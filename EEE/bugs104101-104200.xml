    <WithStack>There are some old translated property files in SSE. They do not contain all 
the messages that we currently used in WTP 0.7. Although these property files 
are not being used at all, they are confusing and I think we should clean them 
up for 0.7. Given that we're just removing old translated property files and 
not changing any code, I believe this is a very low risk fix.

Arthur, can you approve this fix for RC2?
The translations for the following files are currently in our builds:
org.eclipse.jst.jsp.ui\templates\jspdefault-templates.properties

The translations (and only the translations) can be deleted now that they are 
repackaged in NL fragments.

David, I've attached the patches to fix this bug.  If it gets approved for 
RC2, please release.  Thanks.
Approved subject to agreement from David that this will have no impact.
Yes, no impact, just property files. 
Amy, you attached sse.core patch twice ... what that just a browser click error? 
Or ... is there yet another patch you intended to include?


accident.  sorry.  I went ahead and just made one obsolete.

    <WithStack>This bug was introduce around 3.1M6, as it was not reproducable in 3.1M4. It's 
still a problem in the release build and seems to be directly related to 
changing the implementation of Properties from using a table to using a tree 
control. This might be a problem on Windows only.

How to reproduce it:
- implement an IPropertySource and property descriptors which use a label 
provider that gives an image to one or more properties -- the icon is in the 
property display value, not in the property label.
- once there is at least one icon being displayed (in the "Value" column), the 
the text in the "Property" column is indented, as though it were also 
expecting (or requiring) its own image icon.
- if no properties make use of an image, then the whole thing looks fine


Here's an example to give an idea of how it looks:

(with no icon)
+ MyCategory      | 
     MyProperty   | MyValue

(with an icon [*])
+    MyCategory   |
        MyPrope...| [*] MyValue</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The existing GenModel property "basePackage" allows the user to specify the java
package name used when generating the model package.

We have a requirement for api reasons, to differentiate the Interface and
Implementation classes into different packages.

Please add an optional property:  "interfacePackage" or something similar, that
would help this type of setup.  Currently regening and merging in this type of
environment is a nightmare...

Thanks....
We already did this in 2.1.  Select a package in the generator, and look in the
properties under "Package Suffixes".  You'll see all the defaults for the
packages we generate, and you can change any of them.

Each package is named like this:
base package + package name + package suffix

Excellent thanks!!!!!

Is there a new pty file for Rose?   or is this only in the Gen model?
No, there's no new property file and the Rose importer doesn't handle these. 
You'll have to edit them right in the generator.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>To consider with launch simplification:

Currently the property tests for 'isMainType' and 'isApplet' are part of the 
java debug UI plug-in (JavaElementPropertyTester), which means the plug-in 
must be loaded for the property testers to be effective. By moving to the 
launching plug-in the testers will be loaded sooner (as JUI pre-reqs 
lanuching), meaning that the available launch options will be better scoped 
sooner, reducing the available options in the run/debug cascade.
Consider with launching work in 3.2
We should make reusable property tests that are useful for all shortcuts in 
the SDK such as:

* hasMethod (name/signature)
* isSubclass (of fully qualified name)
* references (package name, like 'org.eclipse.swt')

By putting these tests in the org.eclipse.jdt.debug plug-in or the 
org.eclipse.jdt.debug.launching plug-in they will be lower on the food chain 
and more likely be loaded for launch shortcuts to be more 'selective' in the 
UI.

Michael, in light of the fix for bug 112455, does the new property tester just 
consider super classes when testing for applets, rather than supertypes? (Just 
want to make sure this fix does not 'wipe out' the fix to bug 112455).
no, this patch adds in the new PropertyTester but leaves the other one(s) 
alone, just in case they are used elsewhere.

* Added build notes to describe new property tests.
* Changed "hasLibraryRef" to "hasImport" to be more descriptive (I hope :-). 
Fixed bug in "import" test to chech if import exists
* removed the "method visibility" modifier from the hasMethod test. As well, 
added test for main method in binaries as "main, ([Ljava/lang/String;)V"
I've re-worked the property testers:

* Moved to jdt.launching plug-in (I found that the launching plug-in is active when the jdt.debug plug-in is not, and provides better behavior)
* Changed test set to: hasMain, extendsClass, extendsInterface, hasMethod, isContainer, hasProjectNature, buildpathReference
* Supplied updated patches to PDE and JUnit (bug 115008 and bug 125974).
The property tester was incorrectly short circuiting when a java element was a project, pkg root, or pkg. See JavaLaunchableTester in jdt.launching.

    <WithStack>There is no way to move a node in a GEF diagram exclusively through the
keyboard on LINUX.  We have observed this on SUSE Server v9.0 and REDHAT v3.0
both running GTK 2.2.1.

On Windows, this capability is available by navigating to a node using the
arrow keys, and then using the '.' or '&gt;' key to select a "handle" for the node
and then using the arrow keys to move that node around.  This behavior can be
observed using the Logic GEF sample.

On Windows the underlying method on the OS class which performs the work is:

       public void setCursorLocation (int x, int y) {
              checkDevice ();
              OS.SetCursorPos (x, y);
       }

On LINUX it's:

       public void setCursorLocation (int x, int y) {
              checkDevice ();
              /* This is not supported on GTK */
       }

The call that GEF makes to move the cursor has no underlying implementation.

Is there another mechanism that GEF can use to achieve the desired results?
The only platform with accessibility support is win32. Perhaps GTK support has 
improved since that comment was written. Routing to SWT for comment.
For 3.1, we went behind GTK+ and started calling XWarpPointer to implement this
particular call.

Randy, I'm not sure what you mean by "accessibility support", there are lots of
a11y features in GTK+.

    <WithStack>I tried deploying EJb on JonAS but 

1. jonas-ejb-jar.xml was  not generated, so i went to the J2EE Annotations
preference and checked the ejbdoclet  JonAS  for JonAS.

2. jonas-ejb-jar.xml was generated but it is not updated with the beans 
created.

3. The stubs/skeletons code is not generated so beans are not usable at all.
Naci 1 and 2 looks like a xdoclet problem. I am investigating the 3.
Hi guys,

0.7 is approaching fast and this one is showing up since it is 'major'. If you
are planning to fix this, please set the target and try to have a fix within the
next couple days. Otherwise, please drop to P4, target, and provide
justification for deferring. Thanks.
1) Jonas needs a special xdoclet library that needs to be downloaded seperately
from ObjectWeb and copied into the xdoclet lib folder.  The file can be found at:

http://forge.objectweb.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5

for example for Jonas 4.2 download xdocletForJOnAS42.zip
http://forge.objectweb.org/project/download.php?group_id=5&amp;file_id=2945   

2) Jonas requires EJB compiler to preprocess files prior to deployment (unlike
jboss, weblogic, websphere).  I have requested an enhancement at JOnAS newgroups
for this and opened an tracker 
http://forge.objectweb.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=303779&amp;group_id=5&amp;atid=350005

3) JOnAS cannot treat ejb-client.jar properly. Developers will need to create
very plain EJB modules. I opened a bug at JOnAS.


4) Migrated the new generic serverdef from Lomboz to WTP, that integrates JOnAS
ejbjar task into the publish process.  That should provide solution to this bug.
 The solution should be available with RC2.

    <WithStack>When using the FULL_SELECTION Style in a Tree (btw Constructor is not telling
that FULL_SELECTION is allowed) I expected the resulting Tree to still show all
connector lines to indicate the hierachy.

But the Tree is just showing the Elements, indented as the hierachy is, but
missing the connector lines.

Im not really sure this is legal code, but if it isn't eclipse should probably
mark it as such.
There is no such restriction from the language spec.
Closing as javac bug
Reopening. Actually the spec disallow this scenario; though not super clear.

    <WithStack>Debug views need to be more flexible in view updates and allow models to have 
better control on when/how views should be updated.
Created attachment 24870
Design Document on View Update Policy
Under consideration for 3.2
Can we shut this one down now that we have Update Policies for each of our views and we have model proxies and model proxy deltas to allow the model to control the view better?
The view update policy is now static and it's default to update immediately after a model delta event.  Are there plans to make that more pluggable?  Or are we relying solely on model proxy to fire events differently based on some update policy setting?  

We can close this one as this is a generic bug to look at update policies in general.  If we need more enhancements with the current implementation of update policies, we can open new ones.

Sam
We don't plan to make update policies more pluggable in 3.2. The intent is that developers will subclass and create their own update policies as requried. The default policy is to update all the time based on the model proxy. The model proxy allows a model to drive the view updating.

The only other generic update policy we could have is "udpate on demand" - i.e. Refresh (F5). I'm not sure we need that right now.

I agree to close, as we've done what we intended here. More specific bugs can be opened as required.

Marking fixed (update policy == model proxy here).

When selecting a word and invoking ctrl-space and selecting the "comment word"
template a small "empty" message box opens containing an "OK" button, the error
icon (red circle with white cross) and  a headline "Template..." only.

There are no entries in the error log.
I cannot reproduce this problem on Eclipse 3.2 dev stream.
(In reply to comment #1)
&gt; I cannot reproduce this problem on Eclipse 3.2 dev stream.

I tried with Eclipse 3.2M2 and it's still the same. Sorry.

Can I provide addtional information?
Exact steps to reproduce as I must be missing something.
A screen shot of the message box may help in the dianosis as well. Thanks.
Darin, I have the same issue on 3.2M2.

Create templates for Ant and AntTask categories in Ant Editor as in previous
comment.

Open any Ant editor. Select some word or line (e.g. property within project,
some properties or tasks within target), push Ctrl-Space to activate completion
and choose one of these templates. This error popup dialog appear.

I don't think there should be any dialogs like this in first place. Because any
modal popups are really distracting.
(In reply to comment #3)
&gt; Exact steps to reproduce as I must be missing something.
&gt; A screen shot of the message box may help in the dianosis as well. Thanks.
I get the same message box as Eugene but I don't get any entries in the .log
file (well, there is no .log file in .metadata).

I'm using Eclipse 3.2M2 on Windows 2000 with JDK 5 (build 1.5.0_04-b05)

Here are my templates:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;templates&gt;&lt;template autoinsert="true"
context="org.eclipse.ant.ui.templateContextType.task" deleted="false"
description="" enabled="true" name="comment line"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- &amp;#13;
${line_selection} &amp;#13;
--&amp;gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;template autoinsert="true"
context="org.eclipse.ant.ui.templateContextType.task" deleted="false"
description="" enabled="true" name="comment word"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- ${word_selection}
--&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/template&gt;&lt;/templates&gt;

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new workspace
2. Import above templates to ant templates
3. Create java project
4. Create build.xml file
5. Open with Ant Editor
6. &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Space&gt; and select "Buildfile template"
7. Select line with "&lt;/description&gt;" (line 13 in template)
8. &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Space&gt; and select "Comment line -"
9. Dialog Box as attached appears.

CC Tom for the similarities to bug 126662.

Tom can you help out by detailing what was fixed in the Java space to help me more quickly narrow down what needs to be fixed here...or if it is a general bug in the template framework for non Java template completions

&gt; more quickly narrow down what needs to be fixed here...or if it is a general
&gt; bug in the template framework for non Java template completions

The fix was Java(doc) only, and the fix was to use the Position based constructor of DocumentTemplateContext in order to track the active area where the template is being expanded.

The trace in comment 4 seems not related to templates however and I doubt it triggered that "error dialog".

I could reproduce the error, and I believe it is due to a bug in AntContext::getEnd. The method currently returns the length of the active area, but it should return its end offset. The following patch fixed that particular problem in my workspace (beware of line breaks):

Thanks for the help Tom.
This pointed me in the right direction.

There was the bug you found and then we also needed to consider selection when setting up the context.

Fixed in AntContext and AntEditorCompletionProcessor.
I also added the comment templates as defaults so there are changes to ant.properties and ant.xml in the templates folder.
Please verify Kevin.

    <WithOutStack>I added the templates as described in
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41118#c5

When selecting a word and invoking ctrl-space and selecting the "comment word"
template a small "empty" message box opens containing an "OK" button, the error
icon (red circle with white cross) and  a headline "Template..." only.

There are no entries in the error log.
I cannot reproduce this problem on Eclipse 3.2 dev stream.

&gt; I cannot reproduce this problem on Eclipse 3.2 dev stream.

I tried with Eclipse 3.2M2 and it's still the same. Sorry.

Can I provide addtional information?
Exact steps to reproduce as I must be missing something.
A screen shot of the message box may help in the dianosis as well. Thanks.
Darin, I have the same issue on 3.2M2.

Error popup screenshot

Create templates for Ant and AntTask categories in Ant Editor as in previous
comment.

Open any Ant editor. Select some word or line (e.g. property within project,
some properties or tasks within target), push Ctrl-Space to activate completion
and choose one of these templates. This error popup dialog appear.

I don't think there should be any dialogs like this in first place. Because any
modal popups are really distracting.

I get the same message box as Eugene but I don't get any entries in the .log
file (well, there is no .log file in .metadata).

I'm using Eclipse 3.2M2 on Windows 2000 with JDK 5 (build 1.5.0_04-b05)

Here are my templates:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;templates&gt;&lt;template autoinsert="true"
context="org.eclipse.ant.ui.templateContextType.task" deleted="false"
description="" enabled="true" name="comment line"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- &amp;#13;

description="" enabled="true" name="comment word"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- ${word_selection}
--&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/template&gt;&lt;/templates&gt;

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new workspace
2. Import above templates to ant templates
3. Create java project
4. Create build.xml file
5. Open with Ant Editor
6. &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Space&gt; and select "Buildfile template"
7. Select line with "&lt;/description&gt;" (line 13 in template)
8. &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Space&gt; and select "Comment line -"
9. Dialog Box as attached appears.
10. Press "Ok"
11. Nothing happens to build file

Since the GridData field grabExcessVerticalSpace is false for the left table,
the table will be laid out at its preferred height, and the height of the
left cell will never go below that value. This also means that the height
of the entire row (including the right cell) will not go below that value.
The right table is thus prevented from becoming less tall, and that's why
you don't get a vertical scroll bar. I think this is the expected behaviour.
I agree with Florian.</WithStack>

Since the GridData field grabExcessVerticalSpace is false for the left table,
the table will be laid out at its preferred height, and the height of the
left cell will never go below that value. This also means that the height
of the entire row (including the right cell) will not go below that value.
The right table is thus prevented from becoming less tall, and that's why
you don't get a vertical scroll bar. I think this is the expected behaviour.
I agree with Florian.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>If a task is actived in a query category and you close eclipse, you will not
be able to refresh any of the bugzilla stuff since bugs should not be active.

A
work around is to either deactivate the task, or make sure that there is a copy
of that task in another category
Consider if this is easier to fix by bringing up the old query results.  That 
would solve this problem, and make the task list behave the way more like 
people expect it to.  The &lt;needs refresh&gt; thing is still a good idea to leave 
on though, since it's a useful hint.
Solve by: 
- On refresh, if a report is active  but not in any category (e.g. query 
category or task category) then add it to the root, and pop up a dialog saying 
that it was added to the root.
- There could be more than one active bug, and this search could theoretically 
be slow, but the refresh will alsways be dominated by the server job anyway.

This has been fixed by the above method.  It notifies the user that it has been
moved to the root.</WithStack>

WSDL editor does not show Apache Axis generate WSDL files correctly. Basically, 
there's nothing shown in the WSDL editor (I just see the 
Imports/Types/Services/... boxes). Nothing in .log. The WSDL editor shows the 
WSDL wizard generated WSDL files correctly. Perhaps this is a rpc/encoded vs. a 
doc/lit thing? Here's the Apache Axis generated WSDL file:

&lt;wsdl:definitions targetNamespace="http://test" xmlns:impl="http://test"

         &lt;wsdlsoap:address

      &lt;/wsdl:port&gt;

&lt;/wsdl:definitions&gt;

Patch for the missing definition name

The previous patch makes it possible to open WSDL files missing the name definition without throwing an exception, however, the name element would be null instead of the empty string. This is solved in the attached patch.</WithStack>

WSDL editor does not show Apache Axis generate WSDL files correctly. Basically, 
there's nothing shown in the WSDL editor (I just see the 
Imports/Types/Services/... boxes). Nothing in .log. The WSDL editor shows the 
WSDL wizard generated WSDL files correctly. Perhaps this is a rpc/encoded vs. a 
doc/lit thing? Here's the Apache Axis generated WSDL file:

    <WithStack>Using the New wizard to generate an XML file from an XML Schema (either using 
a workspace schema file or a catalog entry) generates the .xml file with a

This prevents opening the file using either the XML editor or a text editor.

Workaround: open with Text editor and click Set Encoding... button to set a

Sorry, all, this was an unintened partial clean-up of some old code that did not

    <WithStack>I posed this question to the newsgroup and it was suggested I entered an
enhancement request for this:

I am having a problem checking out a CVS module alias, (ALL - which
expands to around 50 modules). To be more specific, the created projects
(one per module as expected) are not created a Java projects, ie empty
&lt;buildSpec&gt; and &lt;natures&gt; are empty. I was unable to add a builder
through Eclipse. 

Manually editing the .project files and identifying the src folder in
the build path in Eclipse did not actually identify the src folder, the
icon did not change and the folder still expands one level at a time. 

So starting from scratch and checking out one folder at a time, using
the "Check out as a project configured using the New Project
Wizard" (which is NOT an option when checking out an expanding module
alias) all is well.
This is related to bug 102527. However, it differs slightly in that multiple 
projects are involved. CVS currently does support single project configuration 
(as you have mentioned) because it can make use of support offered by the UI 
and JDT. However, no such support exists for multiple projects. Moving to JDT 
since they would need to provide some means of configuring multiple projects 
for this to work.
Michael, you mention an existing  single project configuration support? What is that exactly?
Martin, I am refering to the New Project wizard which allows the user to pick the type of project. We hacked in support that would open the New Project wizard, catch the creation of the project using a delta listener and then checkout into that project. This works wiuth a single project but obviously doesn't scale well to multiple projects.
I wonder if it would be possible for JDT to auto-detect that new simple projects are actually Java projects? We added the ability to CVS to auto-detected and shae CVS projects that are imported from the file system and added a preference to diable this in the rare cases where the user doesn't want this. Would this be possible for JDT to do? Another option would be to surface some sort of project-type analysis that can be surfaced as API to any import mechanism that they can run at the end of their import. Such a mechanism could even have a wizard page or dialog associated with it that would allow the user to see what types of associations are possible for he projects they have imported. Of course, such a dialog would also need to offer the ability to make the associations.
That would indeed be a good thing to have. Can you or core.resources create an extension point that we can implement?

For the user it might be best if he could specify on check out what the project is: Something like 'Check out as... Java Projects'. I think that might be better than something automatic as a wrong guessed nature is again difficult to fix for the user. And, we're avoiding the problems of choosing if its a Java project or a WebProject.

I guess the importer can also first check is a .projects is a around and only ask the question when not found.

Back to Team.
We'll investigate possible solutions and see what we can come up with.
We do not have the manpower to address this in 3.3.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In FindAction, we call getFullyQualifiedName(ICElement)when the user selects
something from the CView. This appends '::' as it climbs up the CModel. So, if
we selected MyClass in the CView, we would actually search for ::MyClass. This
always leads to no results. Note that search from the Editor and Outline view
work well.

    <WithStack>CVS history view is using a horisontal scroller without word wrap. There should
be an option to enable wrapping.
Created attachment 24881
Patch implementing this functionality

Added an action to view menu for CVS resource history to flip word wrap on and
off. Setting is saved similar to other actions from this menu.
Thanks for the patch
*** Bug 50591 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Patch released. I rearranged the menu ordering and added a separator just to 
separate the text wrapping from the pane showing/hidding.
Thanks Michael. 

By the way, do you know when nightly/integration builds will be resumed for 3.1
or 3.2 stream?
I don't know the exact time but it should be sometime this week (i.e. they are 
doing a hardware upgrade and the plan was to be completed last week).
Verified in I20050808-2000.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>As of Eclipse v3.1, the recommended way to package plugins is as OSGi bundles
(manifest files) and using jar files. Although they are fairly easy to do,
combined these changes will improve unzip/install time, reduce disk footprint 
by
30% or more, reduce startup time, and improve runtime management of the 
plugins.

Steps for creating the manifest file and for defining the plugin packaging in 
one jar( for a concrete sample look at the o.e.h.ui plugin):
- create the Manifest file
Open the plugin.xml file then select on the Overview page the 'create an OSGI 
bundel manifest' option. This will automatically create the manifest file and 
update the build.properties
- set the plugin to be packaged in one jar. To do that:
1.Open the manifest.mf file then delete the Bundle-Classpath header.
2. Change the build.properties: 
Change all occurences of the old jar name to simply a dot. (.) 
There should be one on the bin.includes line. For instance, if your 
bin.includes line used to have core.jar, that will be replaced with a ..For 
instance: bin.includes=about.html,.,META-INF/MANIFEST.MF 
Change source.foo.jar= to source..= (that is source dot dot) 
Change output.foo.jar= to output..= (that is output dot dot) 
There may be others like jars.compile.order, etc 

3.Change the feature :
find all features that list your plug-in and add following to the related 
&lt;plugin&gt; tag:
    unpack="false"


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 90736 ***
Reopen the bug so that this bugzilla can be used to check in the actual work.
org.eclipse.hyades.resources.database has been changed to a JAR, but
org.eclipse.tptp.platform.models was not because o.e.t.p.m is packaged in the
RAC. I'll open a separate defect for o.e.t.p.m and mark this one "FIXED" because
it shows that work was done in 4.1 i1 for this.
Reopening because I found out that this plug-in is used by the stand-alone LTA.
I backed out the change for this defect, and this plug-in should be migrated to
a JAR in 4.2 (or the next API-breaking release).
Changing to 4.2 because this change should not happen in 4.1.
Moving to future because 4.2 is not an API-breaking release.
Can you add  the Manifest file in 4.2
This is not a breaking change
Are you sure that adding a Manifest isn't a breaking change? I thought that adding it meant that the API in the plugin class needed to change, i.e., from this:
	public DatabasePlugin(IPluginDescriptor descriptor) {
to this:
	public DatabasePlugin() {
I thought that the IPluginDescriptor wouldn't work in a plug-in after the "org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility" plug-in wasn't used any more, and that once you created a Manifest that you had to remove "org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility" from the dependencies list?
Yes, you will need to remove the compatibility layer but plugin class is not API so there is nothing to be broken

Pleaes review this with Marius; I don't agree that creating the manifest file and removing the compatibility layer is a breaking change

This change can be done in 4.2
Hi Valentina,

Consulting Marius alone wouldn't be enough because this involves the packaging inside the RAC, and the RAC is extended by some consumers. I thought that the path &amp; structure of the RAC zip was public API because changes to it would require RAC extenders to update their pluginconfig.xml file, and I'm not familiar enough with the RAC to know if the changes would stop there. 

Here's an example response that we received when we changed the RAC path: 
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/tptp-tracing-profiling-tools-dev/msg00081.html

What do you think?

Thanks,
Ruth.
I think we are talking about different things; you are referring to jar packaging while I was asking if the plugin can have the manifest file created and use the osgi bundle instead of the compatibility layer.
There are no plugin packaging or API changes involved in doing that.

I talked to Marius last week and he understood my point and was planning to fix the problem. 
I already did part of it, I will close it today.
I will not convert the plugins to JAR (because we cannot do that in the two plugins that are model related) but I will do the other changes.
Fix in CVS.

    <WithStack>As of Eclipse v3.1, the recommended way to package plugins is as OSGi bundles
(manifest files) and using jar files. Although they are fairly easy to do,
combined these changes will improve unzip/install time, reduce disk footprint 
by
30% or more, reduce startup time, and improve runtime management of the 
plugins.

Steps for creating the manifest file and for defining the plugin packaging in 
one jar( for a concrete sample look at the o.e.h.ui plugin):
- create the Manifest file
Open the plugin.xml file then select on the Overview page the 'create an OSGI 
bundel manifest' option. This will automatically create the manifest file and 
update the build.properties
- set the plugin to be packaged in one jar. To do that:
1.Open the manifest.mf file then delete the Bundle-Classpath header.
2. Change the build.properties: 
Change all occurences of the old jar name to simply a dot. (.) 
There should be one on the bin.includes line. For instance, if your 
bin.includes line used to have core.jar, that will be replaced with a ..For 
instance: bin.includes=about.html,.,META-INF/MANIFEST.MF 
Change source.foo.jar= to source..= (that is source dot dot) 
Change output.foo.jar= to output..= (that is output dot dot) 
There may be others like jars.compile.order, etc

3.Change the feature :

Please carefully review the result of packaging a plugin in a jar ( second 
step in the defect description). There are some scenarios where this will 
break components which depend on the jar name generated by the plugin.
As an example, any plugins generating jars packaged with the RAC runtime 
should not be packaged as a plugin since this can break RAC.

Note that the creation of the manifest file does not affect these 'runtime' 
plugins ( first step in this defect description ); the manifest file can be 
safely created for any type of plugin. This will reduce the eclipse startup 
time since the manifest file is created on the fly when the plugin is first 
loaded

As per the August 5, 2005 Architecture Group call, the following plug-ins will 
NOT be packaged as OSGi bundles/JAR file with a manifest file:

org.apache.jakarta_commons_logging
org.eclipse.hyades.logging.core
org.eclipse.hyades.test.tools.core

However, the following plug-ins will be packaged as OSGi bundles/JAR file with 
a manifest file:

org.apache.jakarta_log4j_logging
org.eclipse.hyades.execution.correlation
org.eclipse.hyades.execution.trace

As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed.

    <WithOutStack>As of Eclipse v3.1, the recommended way to package plugins is as OSGi bundles
(manifest files) and using jar files. Although they are fairly easy to do,
combined these changes will improve unzip/install time, reduce disk footprint 
by
30% or more, reduce startup time, and improve runtime management of the 
plugins.

Steps for creating the manifest file and for defining the plugin packaging in 
one jar( for a concrete sample look at the o.e.h.ui plugin):
- create the Manifest file
Open the plugin.xml file then select on the Overview page the 'create an OSGI 
bundel manifest' option. This will automatically create the manifest file and 
update the build.properties
- set the plugin to be packaged in one jar. To do that:
1.Open the manifest.mf file then delete the Bundle-Classpath header.
2. Change the build.properties: 
Change all occurences of the old jar name to simply a dot. (.) 
There should be one on the bin.includes line. For instance, if your 
bin.includes line used to have core.jar, that will be replaced with a ..For 
instance: bin.includes=about.html,.,META-INF/MANIFEST.MF 
Change source.foo.jar= to source..= (that is source dot dot) 
Change output.foo.jar= to output..= (that is output dot dot) 
There may be others like jars.compile.order, etc 

3.Change the feature :
find all features that list your plug-in and add following to the related 
&lt;plugin&gt; tag:
    unpack="false"

    <WithStack>As of Eclipse v3.1, the recommended way to package plugins is as OSGi bundles
(manifest files) and using jar files. Although they are fairly easy to do,
combined these changes will improve unzip/install time, reduce disk footprint 
by
30% or more, reduce startup time, and improve runtime management of the 
plugins.

Steps for creating the manifest file and for defining the plugin packaging in 
one jar( for a concrete sample look at the o.e.h.ui plugin):
- create the Manifest file
Open the plugin.xml file then select on the Overview page the 'create an OSGI 
bundel manifest' option. This will automatically create the manifest file and 
update the build.properties
- set the plugin to be packaged in one jar. To do that:
1.Open the manifest.mf file then delete the Bundle-Classpath header.
2. Change the build.properties: 
Change all occurences of the old jar name to simply a dot. (.) 
There should be one on the bin.includes line. For instance, if your 
bin.includes line used to have core.jar, that will be replaced with a ..For 
instance: bin.includes=about.html,.,META-INF/MANIFEST.MF 
Change source.foo.jar= to source..= (that is source dot dot) 
Change output.foo.jar= to output..= (that is output dot dot) 
There may be others like jars.compile.order, etc 

3.Change the feature :
find all features that list your plug-in and add following to the related 
&lt;plugin&gt; tag:
    unpack="false"
Please carefully review the result of packaging a plugin in a jar ( second 
step in the defect description). There are some scenarios where this will 
break components which depend on the jar name generated by the plugin.
As an example, any plugins generating jars packaged with the RAC runtime 
should not be packaged as a plugin since this can break RAC.

Note that the creation of the manifest file does not affect these 'runtime' 
plugins ( first step in this defect description ); the manifest file can be 
safely created for any type of plugin. This will reduce the eclipse startup 
time since the manifest file is created on the fly when the plugin is first 
loaded

Done, please note that the Bundle-Classpath header is still there, and that the 
plugins needs to be unpacked (feature). When the complete procedure is 
followed, there are issues at run time with inner classes.

To sum up:
Manifest are created and the build.properties refers to the jar name, not to '.'

    <WithStack>Summary:
For some reasons, I've to start two application servers based on Weblogic v8.1.
These two servers use the same config.xml file and located on the same 
directory but use different start or stop scripts like startWebLogicMib.cmd, 
stopWebLogicMib.cmd, startWebLogicWeb.cmd and stopWebLogicWeb.cmd.

Problem:
After I start these two servers, it will always use the scripts belong to the 
last started server.

Setps:
1. Start the first server. (startWebLogicMib.cmd)
2. Start the second one. (startWebLogicWeb.cmd)
3. Stop the first server. (stopWebLogicMib.cmd)

Result:
It will execute the stopWebLogicWeb.cmd script.

Work around:
I can execute stopWebLogicMib.cmd to stop the server by myself.
This looks identical to the bug (#103705) in which property values are being
shared between generic server instances of the same type; I'm not the owner so I
can't resolve as duplicate but I think that's what should be done here.

Trying to open an xml file with a xsd declaration and a root &lt;project&gt; element +
a &lt;target&gt; element results in a blank editor with the message: "the document is
empty. Right mouse click here to insert content" (right click does nothing)

This is a sample document:

=====
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;configuration&gt;

                &lt;/configuration&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
=====

It seems that, despite of the xsd declaration, eclipse is using the ant editor
for this file. This is the error log:

renaming the root &lt;project&gt; to something different (e.g. &lt;projectx&gt;) and
closing/reopening the file makes the editor work. It also works after removing
the contained &lt;target&gt; element.
A big issue for people using maven (the sample document is a maven 2 pom)
We'll look if can work around for 0.7. 

Fabrizio, can you tell me ... do all "maven" files have the schema defined in them? 

If so, we might be able to work around bug 89195 by defining a "maven content
type" but will have to investigate which would "win" if both claim validity for
this file. And, I assume the file names are always completely open, generic.xml
files, right? (not like "build.xml" is pretty typically "reserved" for ant?) 

&gt; do all "maven" files have the schema defined in them? 
No, the xds is optional (and usually most of the maven project files don't
contain the schema reference)

&gt; And, I assume the file names are always completely open, generic.xml
files, right? (not like "build.xml" is pretty typically "reserved" for ant?) 
No, actually the names are "project.xml" and "maven.xml" for maven 1 and
"pom.xml" for maven 2 (ant the name can't be changed like you can do for ant files)

I tried the suggested workaround: adding a specific pom.xml entry in "content
type"-&gt;"xml" (note, without any special "maven" content type) makes the editor
work correctly. After removing the "pom.xml" entry, leaving only the default
*.xml mapping, the editor fails to load.


Well, I think the best work-around for now -- WTP 0.7 -- is to simply explicitly
list that "project.xml" and "maven.xml" and "pom.xml" are "XML Content Type".
There might be some future improvement from bug 89195 ... but ... not sure how
much can be done -- the overall "element signature" of these two types seems
pretty similar (project, target etc .... I'm not sure there's an easy way to
distinguish 'ant' and 'maven' based on tags. And ... since the maven file names
can not be changed, sounds like a good candidate for a "hard coded" list of files.

The only question if is is "fair" to let each user do this, or "safe" for us to
do it in our distributed plugins. Some reasons it might be not "safe" ... do
other "types of content" assume file names like "project.xml" means something
(besides maven, or do ant users ever use that for their ant files?). 

As I write this, seems not very safe for us to add to the potential for "usurped
content types" ... so, I think best we can do is leave it to users to use the
contentType preference settings, add these three file names explicitly to "XML
Content Type" . That gives them higher priority to be resovled as "XML Content
Type" instead of "Ant Content Type".  Feel free to offer other opinons and/or
suggestions. 

Even though a hassel, I'm not sure we know any way to fix this safely (wihout
adding to the potential for conflicts) other than to let users define themselves
in their own preferences. Therefore, while opened as 'major', I'm setting to
"P4" to indicate no  fix is planned for WTP .7. The "workaround" is pretty easy
to do. 

Long term, the ant content type could be improved to ensure the "peeked at"
element signature really matched the ant content model (for example
&lt;target&gt;1.4&lt;/target&gt; does not seem like a valid ant statement (from what I know
of it), but the ant content type assumes it is. 

Oh, and I should note here, as I have for Ant, we may eventually want to define
some re-usable "content type describers" that take adavantage of a processing
instruction in xml files to unamiguously identify the content type ... such as
&lt;?eclipse-maven?&gt; that users could potentially take advantage of to
unambiguously mark something as a certain type of content. Just an idea. 

Moving back to appropriate priority now that 0.7 is released. 
It's not that easy for the user to set.  I tried without success.

I have associated pom.xml to the XML content type, but then, it is still the ANT
editor that is used.  And of curse, a problem is reported with the first line
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"&gt;

If I go in file association, and I add pom.xml (and put XML Editor as the
default), when I open the file, I still get


!ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui 2 2 2005-07-16 12:36:53.593
!MESSAGE StructuredTextEditor being used without StructuredDocument

!MESSAGE         Unexpected IDocument implementation:

So either, the workaround doesn't work, either I miss something when setting the
preferences.  And the second case, it means that something is not intuitive enought 
This remains a year later a very annoying bug, and the workaround doesn't work - although the content styling changes is "maven.xml" is assigned to be of XML type, WST still applies validation rules for Ant, and for example complains on the following maven file:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project default="full" &gt;
	&lt;goal name="full"&gt;
		&lt;attainGoal name="jar:install" /&gt;
	&lt;/goal&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;

"Default target full does not exist in this project".

That "target" message doesn't some from WST ... it comes from ant component. 
And, I believe, only when opened with the ant editor. And, to make it worse, I think once the ant editor creates the marker, its never gets removed, which I mention just because I wonder if there error message of yours has just been "hanging around" for a long time? Or ... does it just appear at some point. 


Is there any way to get rid of marker at all?  This is VERY annoying.

(In reply to comment #9)
&gt; That "target" message doesn't some from WST ... it comes from ant component. 
&gt; And, I believe, only when opened with the ant editor. And, to make it worse, I
&gt; think once the ant editor creates the marker, its never gets removed, which I

&gt; "hanging around" for a long time? Or ... does it just appear at some point. 
&gt; 
The behavior doesn't play well with maven, which uses the "project" root tag.
The original problem described in comment #0 seems to be fixed. I can double-click an XML file with those contents and it opens up the WST XML editor just fine. I do get hit with what's described in comment #8 though since Eclipse opens that file up with the Ant editor.

I am not sure what a correct solution would be. How would the Ant plug-in know that that file is not actually an Ant build file?

It does look like you can work around this by using 'Open With' to use the XML editor (and then forever and after Eclipse should use that editor when you double-click), though.
(In reply to comment #8)
&gt; "Default target full does not exist in this project".

WST doesn't do anything with Ant, it's Ant telling you that particular message.


(In reply to comment #13)
&gt; (In reply to comment #8)
&gt; &gt; "Default target full does not exist in this project".
&gt; 
&gt; WST doesn't do anything with Ant, it's Ant telling you that particular message.
&gt; 

What Nitin says is correct.  If you open this with the WTP XML editor there is no validation error message reported.  If you open it with the Eclipse ANT editor then you get the error message for comment #8.   Nitin can this one be closed now?

Verified in WTP 3.2 that file with project does not give any error when opened with WTP XML editor. Can be closed
From reviewing the comments it sounds like the original problem has been fixed and the other issue from comment 8 isn't a WTP issue. Resolving. If this is still an issue, please reopen the bug. Thanks.</WithStack>

I tried the suggested workaround: adding a specific pom.xml entry in "content
type"-&gt;"xml" (note, without any special "maven" content type) makes the editor
work correctly. After removing the "pom.xml" entry, leaving only the default
*.xml mapping, the editor fails to load.


Well, I think the best work-around for now -- WTP 0.7 -- is to simply explicitly
list that "project.xml" and "maven.xml" and "pom.xml" are "XML Content Type".
There might be some future improvement from bug 89195 ... but ... not sure how
much can be done -- the overall "element signature" of these two types seems
pretty similar (project, target etc .... I'm not sure there's an easy way to
distinguish 'ant' and 'maven' based on tags. And ... since the maven file names
can not be changed, sounds like a good candidate for a "hard coded" list of files.

The only question if is is "fair" to let each user do this, or "safe" for us to
do it in our distributed plugins. Some reasons it might be not "safe" ... do
other "types of content" assume file names like "project.xml" means something
(besides maven, or do ant users ever use that for their ant files?). 

As I write this, seems not very safe for us to add to the potential for "usurped
content types" ... so, I think best we can do is leave it to users to use the
contentType preference settings, add these three file names explicitly to "XML
Content Type" . That gives them higher priority to be resovled as "XML Content
Type" instead of "Ant Content Type".  Feel free to offer other opinons and/or
suggestions. 

Even though a hassel, I'm not sure we know any way to fix this safely (wihout
adding to the potential for conflicts) other than to let users define themselves
in their own preferences. Therefore, while opened as 'major', I'm setting to
"P4" to indicate no  fix is planned for WTP .7. The "workaround" is pretty easy
to do. 

Long term, the ant content type could be improved to ensure the "peeked at"
element signature really matched the ant content model (for example
&lt;target&gt;1.4&lt;/target&gt; does not seem like a valid ant statement (from what I know
of it), but the ant content type assumes it is. 

Oh, and I should note here, as I have for Ant, we may eventually want to define
some re-usable "content type describers" that take adavantage of a processing
instruction in xml files to unamiguously identify the content type ... such as
&lt;?eclipse-maven?&gt; that users could potentially take advantage of to
unambiguously mark something as a certain type of content. Just an idea. 

Moving back to appropriate priority now that 0.7 is released. 
It's not that easy for the user to set.  I tried without success.

I have associated pom.xml to the XML content type, but then, it is still the ANT
editor that is used.  And of curse, a problem is reported with the first line
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"&gt;

If I go in file association, and I add pom.xml (and put XML Editor as the
default), when I open the file, I still get


!ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui 2 2 2005-07-16 12:36:53.593
!MESSAGE StructuredTextEditor being used without StructuredDocument

!ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui 2 2 2005-07-16 12:36:53.593
!MESSAGE          Input Name: pom.xml

!ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui 2 2 2005-07-16 12:36:53.603
!MESSAGE         Unexpected IDocument implementation:
org.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.editor.text.PartiallySynchronizedDocument

So either, the workaround doesn't work, either I miss something when setting the
preferences.  And the second case, it means that something is not intuitive enought 
This remains a year later a very annoying bug, and the workaround doesn't work - although the content styling changes is "maven.xml" is assigned to be of XML type, WST still applies validation rules for Ant, and for example complains on the following maven file:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project default="full" &gt;
	&lt;goal name="full"&gt;
		&lt;attainGoal name="jar:install" /&gt;
	&lt;/goal&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;

"Default target full does not exist in this project".

That "target" message doesn't some from WST ... it comes from ant component. 
And, I believe, only when opened with the ant editor. And, to make it worse, I think once the ant editor creates the marker, its never gets removed, which I mention just because I wonder if there error message of yours has just been "hanging around" for a long time? Or ... does it just appear at some point. 


Is there any way to get rid of marker at all?  This is VERY annoying.

&gt; 
The behavior doesn't play well with maven, which uses the "project" root tag.
The original problem described in comment #0 seems to be fixed. I can double-click an XML file with those contents and it opens up the WST XML editor just fine. I do get hit with what's described in comment #8 though since Eclipse opens that file up with the Ant editor.

I am not sure what a correct solution would be. How would the Ant plug-in know that that file is not actually an Ant build file?

It does look like you can work around this by using 'Open With' to use the XML editor (and then forever and after Eclipse should use that editor when you double-click), though.
(In reply to comment #8)
&gt; "Default target full does not exist in this project".

WST doesn't do anything with Ant, it's Ant telling you that particular message.

&gt; &gt; "Default target full does not exist in this project".
&gt;

&gt; 

What Nitin says is correct.  If you open this with the WTP XML editor there is no validation error message reported.  If you open it with the Eclipse ANT editor then you get the error message for comment #8.   Nitin can this one be closed now?

Verified in WTP 3.2 that file with project does not give any error when opened with WTP XML editor. Can be closed
From reviewing the comments it sounds like the original problem has been fixed and the other issue from comment 8 isn't a WTP issue. Resolving. If this is still an issue, please reopen the bug. Thanks.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Working on a project with a couple of thousand classes, it's often usefull to
disable the auto-build to be able to save changes but not yet activate them.
Eclipse currently has an all or nothing situation which is very inconvenient at
certain time.
It would therefore be very easy to have a build class/folder/package (sub)menu.
Please explain "very inconvenient at certain time"
In my case, especially when working on refactorings.
I like to be able to just recompile a package of a class instead of the whole
project. 
The idea is to be able to type and modify code, save the files, maybe see some
possible warnings but not yet overwrite the old ones.
This is not a functionality I need on a day-to-day basis, to do my work but it
would come in handy now and them.

The compile action in the popupmenu when called from the Java-view would only be
visible when build automatic is turned of.
The Java builder is only a participant in the general builder framework. What
you request would require to change the overall build manager.
Moving to platform.

to the document during setDocument. 

Either we need to remove need for that listener stuff or change to 'connect' 
pattern so more obvious is needs to be disconnected. 

For .7, we will minimize changes and just call 'setDocument(null)' when model 
is released, but that's not a good API contract to try and document.
Not sure what to do with this one.  In which class is this setDocument method, I don't see it in IStructuredModel.  My guess this is something that is no longer an issue but some further input would be appreciated.
No plan to change.</WithStack>

          <Line>(see below). This is normal. "</Line>
          <Line />
          <Line>This problem fell through the cracks in 3.1.  Please tell people to first set</Line>

          <Line>won't get the transient error marker and you wouldn't need to mention it.</Line>
          <Line>We will fix this for 3.1.1 (i.e. if the product name is not set in the editor,</Line>
          <Line>we will add an extra field to the wizard) as this seems to be an unpleasant</Line>

          <Line>Updated, added source.</Line>
          <Line>Part 1 has been published, closing.</Line>
          <Line>thanks for the great tutorial (wanted to start with rcp since a while ago ;-)</Line>
          <Line>a few things:</Line>
          <Line>part 2 says " In part 1, we implemented one of the simpler methods,</Line>
          <Line>getInitialWindowPerspectiveId" -- but there's nothing in part 1 mentioning this, seems it</Line>
          <Line>belongs to the "Hello"-template?</Line>
          <Line>there are several code snipptes but nothing about the files those snipptes fit into, a short info</Line>
          <Line>about the file's name would be very nice so a newbee like me knows which files to change ...</Line>
          <Line>Parts 2 and 3 are in the process of being rewritten, see bug 104170 and bug</Line>
          <Line>104171. Until that's done they're not going to match up, sorry.</Line>
          <Line>Part 2 has been updated now.</Line>
          <Line>Based on some feedback I've gotten on this article, I'm thinking of retooling it to get rid of the feature and making the example product plug-in based. The main reason is that it seems that hardly anybody uses just the plugins in the base rcp feature, and this has caused more than one person to stumble despite a note about that in the article. Anybody have any objections to this simplification?</Line>
          <Line>Update for 3.1.2</Line>
          <Line>A new version has been published of all three parts.</Line>
          <Line>Minor, but confusing:</Line>

RCP Tutorial part 1 draft 1

Reassigning to me; interested parties please add yourself to the cc list.

Here's the first draft of the new tutorial, part 1. It was a bit more of a
rewrite than I first thought. I decided to go the full feature-product-native
launcher route that is the recommended best practice althought it made the
tutorial a little longer. Let me know what you think.

Like part 1, I plan for parts 2 and 3 to be similar to the scope of the current
parts but with a much heavier emphasis on using the PDE wizards and editors
than before.

Note that I plan to split up this bugzilla entry to just have one bugzilla per
part; I just think it will be easier to keep the attachments and comments
straight that way and it also lets me publish them on different schedules.
Split off part 2 into bug 104170, and part 3 into bug 104171.
I recommend to have a small "agenda" at the beginning of the first article (like
you may know from presentations). It should describe (very short) what the
reader will see in which part of the article series. That way the reader always
knows where he stands when he is following the tutorial and doesn't get this
feeling of being lost somewhere between blocks of instructions. :)
Hi Ed, I just read the revised article and I like it.

I have a few comments from a PDE perspective:

1. it would be better to focus on 3.1 and not dwell on the past, ie. what 
things were like pre-3.1.
Sentences like the ones below are an unnecessary distraction from the nice 
workflow you are describing.

"This (OSGi bundle format) is different from previous versions where it was 
recommended not to select this format." 

and 
"Trying out RCP applications used to be somewhat tedious. You had to create a 
custom launch configuration, enter the right application name, and tweak the 
plug-ins that were included."

2. "Unfortunately the Hello RCP template does not so we'll have to make one."
This was actually done intentionally, specifically for a case like yours (or 
the upcoming RCP book) when someone is trying to demonstrate the creation of a 
product from first principles.  We have richer templates for those who want 
them.

3. "You may see an error appear in the Problems view until you Synchronize 
(see below). This is normal. "

This problem fell through the cracks in 3.1.  Please tell people to first set 
the product name on the overview page and then press New... This way, they 
won't get the transient error marker and you wouldn't need to mention it.
We will fix this for 3.1.1 (i.e. if the product name is not set in the editor, 
we will add an extra field to the wizard) as this seems to be an unpleasant 
first impression to some.


4. "Typically this would not occur unless you are converting an older plug-in 
that did not use MANIFEST.MF into one that does"
This is not correct.  When you create a manifest.mf file for an existing plug-
in, PDE trims down the plugin.xml file to remove all redundant information, 
and only extensions/extension points are left in the xml file.

5. Very flattered that the troubleshooting section has become obsolete :-)

Nice piece of work overall.
Regarding comment #3, the parts are being written sequentially as I get time so
I don't have a table of contents for the other two parts yet.

Regarding comment #4, 1) I wanted some backward looking stuff to help someone
who read the previous version tell what was different. Maybe I overdid it. 2) It
would be better if the templates were more configurable so I could mix and match
what went into it, like a checkbox for a feature, a product, a view, branding,
etc.. 3) ok, 4) I was referring to a manual conversion, I'll make that clearer.

Thanks for the comments.

RCP Tutorial part 1 draft 2

Updated, added source.
Part 1 has been published, closing.
thanks for the great tutorial (wanted to start with rcp since a while ago ;-)
a few things:
part 2 says " In part 1, we implemented one of the simpler methods, 
getInitialWindowPerspectiveId" -- but there's nothing in part 1 mentioning this, seems it 
belongs to the "Hello"-template?
there are several code snipptes but nothing about the files those snipptes fit into, a short info 
about the file's name would be very nice so a newbee like me knows which files to change ... 
Parts 2 and 3 are in the process of being rewritten, see bug 104170 and bug
104171. Until that's done they're not going to match up, sorry.
Part 2 has been updated now.
Based on some feedback I've gotten on this article, I'm thinking of retooling it to get rid of the feature and making the example product plug-in based. The main reason is that it seems that hardly anybody uses just the plugins in the base rcp feature, and this has caused more than one person to stumble despite a note about that in the article. Anybody have any objections to this simplification?
Update for 3.1.2
A new version has been published of all three parts.
Minor, but confusing: 

"Now select the Configuration tab and click Add.... Select the plug-in you just created (org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1) and then click on Add Required Plug-ins." 

Should specify that the coder should "Open the launch configuration for the product" (otherwise it's opaque which "Configuration" tab is being discussed.) 
At that point you're still in the Product Configuration editor, and don't need to open the launch configuration. You select the Overview tab and do something, select the Configuration tab and do something, then select the Overview tab again and do something. So unless I'm missing something (which is possible!) I think it's correct the way it's written.
(In reply to comment #15)

&gt; think it's correct the way it's written.
&gt; 
I see the problem, now -- the issue I was addressing is that the new plugin does *also* need to be added in the "Plugins" tab of the launch-config wizard -- a step I often forget, and which I was looking to see mentioned in the article. 
I've tried running part 1 in latest 3.2 build and found that exporting the project to \deploy folder exports the plugin only, but not the eclipse executable or core libraries- is this the expected behaviour?
Andreas, you probably exported the plug-in instead of the product. If you export the product it should give you the executable and everything else.
(In reply to comment #12)
&gt; Update for 3.1.2

Does this mean the projects in the 'accompanying zip files' will not work with 3.1.1 any more? 

When launching after exporting as described I get:
...
org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The activator org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.Part1Plugin for bundle org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1 is invalid
...
org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException[1]: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.Application
...
(In reply to comment #19)
OK after deleting...unzipping...importing...not changing anything...exporting again.
If you change anything, like the name of your application or the name of your plug-in or the name of your main class, it's hard to find all the places that need to be changed. I've often had this problem when copying projects. This is better in 3.2 but I don't think it's completely automatic yet.
I am following part 1 of the tutorial: http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-RCP-1/tutorial1.html

I am using Eclipse 3.2 (from the Callisto release).

Comment about the section "Making it a product": There is something missing in the description here. When I follow the steps in the tutorial and try to launch my application from the product config file, I get an error that indicates that the splash screen cannot be found.

Found some more info about this in the bug database: bug #66421

I found the solution in comment #24 of that bug: "Ricky, your product configuration is missing the required bundles.  On the configuration tab of your product definition you must click the "Add Required Plug-ins" button to add the necessary bundles to launch."

The tutorial should mention this.
Thanks for the tip Jesper.
I can't get the first part of the tutorial to work with 3.2. I selected to target 3.2 and the check for a rich client application, and the Hello RCP template.

When I try to run it I see several messages about the following:
!MESSAGE Bundle initial@reference:file:workspace/org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1/ [14] was not resolved.

And the following exception:

java.lang.RuntimeException: Application "org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.application" could not be found in the registry. The applications available are: &lt;NONE&gt;.

I looked at the previous posters comments but I can't get that far.

Thanks for any suggestions!!

If I give a 'simple' name to the plugin, as 'proTest' for instance, it works fine.

Any idea?
Thanks in advance!
I've found that some part of the name produces the issue, but I don't know why, I'm an eclipse newbie.

Any other, of bigger lenght works.
I guess it is the "org.eclipse.ui" part.

I am eager to start understanding Eclipse, so I hope an explanation to this issue will come.

Thanks in advance.
Mike
The "Missing required bundle org.eclipse.ui_0.0.0." error is the main clue, I think. Either there's something wrong with your config.ini (probably in the osgi.bundles line), or maybe you're not supplying all the bundles that are required when you deploy the app (or don't have them selected in the plug-ins tab of the launch configuration).

No, the containment of "org.eclipse.ui" in the name of the plugin generates this error.
If I name it "org.eclipse.gui.xxxx", it works fine. I think there's an issue related to an asumption of the Eclipse framework somewhere based on the "org.eclipse.ui" part of the name in Eclipse 3.2.x.
Hi, I'm Floppy and I have this strange problem. I follwed the tutorial, everything went just fine but, when I tried export the product (Eclipse Product export wizard), it gave me an error message and wrote a file with 47 errors:

47 problems (47 errors)

Any ideas. Please help...
Hi, I'm back to tell you that something strange is happening, indeed. If you saw my previous comment, that problem is happening ONLY in Eclipse 3.2.1 (I have M20060921-0945)! In 3.1.1 (M20050929-0840) there is no problem at all.

More than that, in 3.2.1, the plug-ins that were supposed to be exported as .jar's (as the tutorial says), are actually exported as folders, under "RcpTutorial1/plugins".

Is this strange or what? Can anyone enlighten me, please?
Hi, it's me again. I also made it in Eclipse 3.3.0 (I20061214-1445) and it's working. At this point, maybe it's just the version 3.2.* which has a problem?

Can anyone confirm or infirm this?

Florin, as far as I know you're the only one who has run into this problem. I certainly never saw it in various versions of 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3, though I can't say for sure that I tried it in the exact same versions you tried it in. If it were some kind of generic bug I'd expect to see a lot of people complain about it, but since that's not the case I'd suspect something unique in your setup.

It's easy (I've done it several times myself) to get something messed up in the plug-in dependencies or target environment that could give errors like this, especially when migrating from one version of Eclipse to another. Other common problem sources are problems unpacking the zip, unpacking one version of Eclipse on top of another, and I've even seen a corrupt download or two.
(In reply to comment #32)
First of all, thanks for answering.

I don't know what to say/think, it's just what happened to me. I used different Eclipse installations (not unpacking on top of each other). I still have them installed (each of them also contains other working projects). Every time I followed the tutorial's steps and only on one version it didn't work. Maybe it's just something strange (since nobody else stumbled at the same point).

Anyway, I'm happy I have at least to versions that are working, so I got the picture of Eclipse's RCP mechanism and went on. Thanks.
Hi

I've just completed the tutorial and run my first Eclipse Application. Everything works, i can run the Hello World app as a plugin and as a product from inside Eclipse, the one thing i can't get to work is to run the product standalone. I'm getting the following error:

Any ideas? I remade the tutorial 3 times and followed every step exactly as described.

"Select the version of Eclipse you're targeting (at least 3.1), and enable the option to Create an OSGi bundle manifest."

In version 3.3 you have to pick either an Eclipse version OR an OSGi framework not both. Whats the difference between standard OSGi framework and Equinox OSGi framework ?


(I am a beginner of eclipse. I am using version 3.6)
I followed the first tutorial successfully until creating the project and having it displayed. However in the product definition process, when going to the configuration tab and pressing ADD, the popup window that should contain a list of plugins was void. Later on, after hitting synchonize, the product failed to start with the following log:

RCP Tutorial part 1 draft 1

Reassigning to me; interested parties please add yourself to the cc list.

Here's the first draft of the new tutorial, part 1. It was a bit more of a
rewrite than I first thought. I decided to go the full feature-product-native
launcher route that is the recommended best practice althought it made the
tutorial a little longer. Let me know what you think.

Like part 1, I plan for parts 2 and 3 to be similar to the scope of the current
parts but with a much heavier emphasis on using the PDE wizards and editors
than before.

Note that I plan to split up this bugzilla entry to just have one bugzilla per
part; I just think it will be easier to keep the attachments and comments
straight that way and it also lets me publish them on different schedules.
Split off part 2 into bug 104170, and part 3 into bug 104171.
I recommend to have a small "agenda" at the beginning of the first article (like
you may know from presentations). It should describe (very short) what the
reader will see in which part of the article series. That way the reader always
knows where he stands when he is following the tutorial and doesn't get this
feeling of being lost somewhere between blocks of instructions. :)
Hi Ed, I just read the revised article and I like it.

I have a few comments from a PDE perspective:

1. it would be better to focus on 3.1 and not dwell on the past, ie. what 
things were like pre-3.1.
Sentences like the ones below are an unnecessary distraction from the nice 
workflow you are describing.

"This (OSGi bundle format) is different from previous versions where it was 
recommended not to select this format." 

and 
"Trying out RCP applications used to be somewhat tedious. You had to create a 
custom launch configuration, enter the right application name, and tweak the 
plug-ins that were included."

2. "Unfortunately the Hello RCP template does not so we'll have to make one."
This was actually done intentionally, specifically for a case like yours (or 
the upcoming RCP book) when someone is trying to demonstrate the creation of a 
product from first principles.  We have richer templates for those who want 
them.

3. "You may see an error appear in the Problems view until you Synchronize 
(see below). This is normal. "

This problem fell through the cracks in 3.1.  Please tell people to first set 
the product name on the overview page and then press New... This way, they 
won't get the transient error marker and you wouldn't need to mention it.
We will fix this for 3.1.1 (i.e. if the product name is not set in the editor, 
we will add an extra field to the wizard) as this seems to be an unpleasant 
first impression to some.


4. "Typically this would not occur unless you are converting an older plug-in 
that did not use MANIFEST.MF into one that does"
This is not correct.  When you create a manifest.mf file for an existing plug-
in, PDE trims down the plugin.xml file to remove all redundant information, 
and only extensions/extension points are left in the xml file.

5. Very flattered that the troubleshooting section has become obsolete :-)

Nice piece of work overall.
Regarding comment #3, the parts are being written sequentially as I get time so
I don't have a table of contents for the other two parts yet.

Regarding comment #4, 1) I wanted some backward looking stuff to help someone
who read the previous version tell what was different. Maybe I overdid it. 2) It
would be better if the templates were more configurable so I could mix and match
what went into it, like a checkbox for a feature, a product, a view, branding,
etc.. 3) ok, 4) I was referring to a manual conversion, I'll make that clearer.

Thanks for the comments.

RCP Tutorial part 1 draft 2

Updated, added source.
Part 1 has been published, closing.
thanks for the great tutorial (wanted to start with rcp since a while ago ;-)
a few things:
part 2 says " In part 1, we implemented one of the simpler methods, 
getInitialWindowPerspectiveId" -- but there's nothing in part 1 mentioning this, seems it 
belongs to the "Hello"-template?
there are several code snipptes but nothing about the files those snipptes fit into, a short info 
about the file's name would be very nice so a newbee like me knows which files to change ... 
Parts 2 and 3 are in the process of being rewritten, see bug 104170 and bug
104171. Until that's done they're not going to match up, sorry.
Part 2 has been updated now.
Based on some feedback I've gotten on this article, I'm thinking of retooling it to get rid of the feature and making the example product plug-in based. The main reason is that it seems that hardly anybody uses just the plugins in the base rcp feature, and this has caused more than one person to stumble despite a note about that in the article. Anybody have any objections to this simplification?
Update for 3.1.2
A new version has been published of all three parts.
Minor, but confusing: 

"Now select the Configuration tab and click Add.... Select the plug-in you just created (org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1) and then click on Add Required Plug-ins." 

Should specify that the coder should "Open the launch configuration for the product" (otherwise it's opaque which "Configuration" tab is being discussed.) 
At that point you're still in the Product Configuration editor, and don't need to open the launch configuration. You select the Overview tab and do something, select the Configuration tab and do something, then select the Overview tab again and do something. So unless I'm missing something (which is possible!) I think it's correct the way it's written.
(In reply to comment #15)
&gt; At that point you're still in the Product Configuration editor, and don't need
&gt; to open the launch configuration. You select the Overview tab and do something,

&gt; again and do something. So unless I'm missing something (which is possible!) I
&gt; think it's correct the way it's written.
&gt; 
I see the problem, now -- the issue I was addressing is that the new plugin does *also* need to be added in the "Plugins" tab of the launch-config wizard -- a step I often forget, and which I was looking to see mentioned in the article. 
I've tried running part 1 in latest 3.2 build and found that exporting the project to \deploy folder exports the plugin only, but not the eclipse executable or core libraries- is this the expected behaviour?
Andreas, you probably exported the plug-in instead of the product. If you export the product it should give you the executable and everything else.
(In reply to comment #12)
&gt; Update for 3.1.2

Does this mean the projects in the 'accompanying zip files' will not work with 3.1.1 any more? 

When launching after exporting as described I get:
...
org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The activator org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.Part1Plugin for bundle org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1 is invalid
...
org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException[1]: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.Application
...
(In reply to comment #19)
OK after deleting...unzipping...importing...not changing anything...exporting again.
If you change anything, like the name of your application or the name of your plug-in or the name of your main class, it's hard to find all the places that need to be changed. I've often had this problem when copying projects. This is better in 3.2 but I don't think it's completely automatic yet.
I am following part 1 of the tutorial: http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-RCP-1/tutorial1.html

I am using Eclipse 3.2 (from the Callisto release).

Comment about the section "Making it a product": There is something missing in the description here. When I follow the steps in the tutorial and try to launch my application from the product config file, I get an error that indicates that the splash screen cannot be found.

Found some more info about this in the bug database: bug #66421

I found the solution in comment #24 of that bug: "Ricky, your product configuration is missing the required bundles.  On the configuration tab of your product definition you must click the "Add Required Plug-ins" button to add the necessary bundles to launch."

The tutorial should mention this.
Thanks for the tip Jesper.
I can't get the first part of the tutorial to work with 3.2. I selected to target 3.2 and the check for a rich client application, and the Hello RCP template.

When I try to run it I see several messages about the following:
!MESSAGE Bundle initial@reference:file:workspace/org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1/ [14] was not resolved.

And the following exception:


I looked at the previous posters comments but I can't get that far.

Thanks for any suggestions!!
Hello,

I'm an Eclipse newbie. I've followed the steps of plug-in project creating on Eclipse 3.2. I've run the plug-in and I've got the following error dump:

If I give a 'simple' name to the plugin, as 'proTest' for instance, it works fine.

Any idea?
Thanks in advance!
I've found that some part of the name produces the issue, but I don't know why, I'm an eclipse newbie.

Any other, of bigger lenght works.
I guess it is the "org.eclipse.ui" part.

I am eager to start understanding Eclipse, so I hope an explanation to this issue will come.

Thanks in advance.
Mike
The "Missing required bundle org.eclipse.ui_0.0.0." error is the main clue, I think. Either there's something wrong with your config.ini (probably in the osgi.bundles line), or maybe you're not supplying all the bundles that are required when you deploy the app (or don't have them selected in the plug-ins tab of the launch configuration).

No, the containment of "org.eclipse.ui" in the name of the plugin generates this error.
If I name it "org.eclipse.gui.xxxx", it works fine. I think there's an issue related to an asumption of the Eclipse framework somewhere based on the "org.eclipse.ui" part of the name in Eclipse 3.2.x.
Hi, I'm Floppy and I have this strange problem. I follwed the tutorial, everything went just fine but, when I tried export the product (Eclipse Product export wizard), it gave me an error message and wrote a file with 47 errors:

47 problems (47 errors)

Any ideas. Please help...
Hi, I'm back to tell you that something strange is happening, indeed. If you saw my previous comment, that problem is happening ONLY in Eclipse 3.2.1 (I have M20060921-0945)! In 3.1.1 (M20050929-0840) there is no problem at all.

More than that, in 3.2.1, the plug-ins that were supposed to be exported as .jar's (as the tutorial says), are actually exported as folders, under "RcpTutorial1/plugins".

Is this strange or what? Can anyone enlighten me, please?
Hi, it's me again. I also made it in Eclipse 3.3.0 (I20061214-1445) and it's working. At this point, maybe it's just the version 3.2.* which has a problem?

Can anyone confirm or infirm this?

Florin, as far as I know you're the only one who has run into this problem. I certainly never saw it in various versions of 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3, though I can't say for sure that I tried it in the exact same versions you tried it in. If it were some kind of generic bug I'd expect to see a lot of people complain about it, but since that's not the case I'd suspect something unique in your setup.

It's easy (I've done it several times myself) to get something messed up in the plug-in dependencies or target environment that could give errors like this, especially when migrating from one version of Eclipse to another. Other common problem sources are problems unpacking the zip, unpacking one version of Eclipse on top of another, and I've even seen a corrupt download or two.
(In reply to comment #32)
First of all, thanks for answering.

I don't know what to say/think, it's just what happened to me. I used different Eclipse installations (not unpacking on top of each other). I still have them installed (each of them also contains other working projects). Every time I followed the tutorial's steps and only on one version it didn't work. Maybe it's just something strange (since nobody else stumbled at the same point).

Anyway, I'm happy I have at least to versions that are working, so I got the picture of Eclipse's RCP mechanism and went on. Thanks.
Hi

I've just completed the tutorial and run my first Eclipse Application. Everything works, i can run the Hello World app as a plugin and as a product from inside Eclipse, the one thing i can't get to work is to run the product standalone. I'm getting the following error:

Any ideas? I remade the tutorial 3 times and followed every step exactly as described.

Peter.
"Select the version of Eclipse you're targeting (at least 3.1), and enable the option to Create an OSGi bundle manifest."

In version 3.3 you have to pick either an Eclipse version OR an OSGi framework not both. Whats the difference between standard OSGi framework and Equinox OSGi framework ?


(I am a beginner of eclipse. I am using version 3.6)
I followed the first tutorial successfully until creating the project and having it displayed. However in the product definition process, when going to the configuration tab and pressing ADD, the popup window that should contain a list of plugins was void. Later on, after hitting synchonize, the product failed to start with the following log:

    <WithStack>We have had "complaints" from community and committers in WTP that closed bugs
can not be re-opened. 

We have adopted a workflow where verified bugs are (eventually, if not directly)
put into a 'closed' state, and if it was mis-verified, or subsequently
regresses, the community would like to re-open the original bug, instead of
createing a new one that refers to the old one. 

And, in fact, the document on eclipse bug reporting at
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugzilla.html
does state explicitly "And yes, closed bugs can be reopened if need be."

When I originally reported this bug to webmaster, I was told he'd been asked to 
specifically disallow re-opening closed bugs by some committers who found users
were incorrectly re-opening bugs. 

I'm not sure what that was about, but would seem to be more correctly solved by
user education, than by prohibiting it its correct use. 

In either case, either the Eclipse preferred workflow needs to be better
documented and the document at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugzilla.html corrected,
or we should allow users to re-open closed bugs.
I believe this is a debatable issue.

See bug 83068 comment 7 and bug 83068 comment 8

Some projects want to restrict who can change what, and some projects want it
wide open.

I believe these features should be requested against bugzilla itself. I can't do
much other than determine default behavior, and so far it's been as described in
the comments above.

    <WithStack>The Voice Tools Project would like to allow editing of VoiceXML in the JSP 
editor to complete our markup editing environment. I have tried creating the 
following snippet in the JSP editor:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE vxml PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD VOICEXML 
2.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21/vxml.dtd"&gt;
&lt;vxml version="2.1"&gt;

&lt;/vxml&gt;

The editor complains "Unknown tag (vxml)." on the &lt;vxml&gt; tag. In the content 
assist a few HTML-oriented items are proposed (img,table,ul, etc). I believe I 
have defined
a proper entry in the XML Catalog to go with this DTD. Renaming the snippet 
to .xml and loading the XML editor causes validation and content assist to 
work fine.
Its great to get bugs opened from voiceXML project, and I am sure we have a ways
to go to "get it right" for your content type, so I'm sorry to resolve this as
'wontfix' -- and indeed we *might* be able to improve validation and content
assist for cases like this -- BUT, for this specific case, putting in a page 
directive with the content type identified solves the problem. As below. 
The JSP Specification is pretty specific that if "contentType" is not specified,
then text/html is to be assumed -- which I think is all we are trying to follow.
I suppose you'd need something like this contentType=text/xml or ?vxml?
to get it "served" properly to client, also, right? 

Don't hesitate to re-open if I'm missing the point, and don't hesitate to 
open new ones for all the special cases you'll have for us to handle.

When using a table cursor, there are two kinds of table regions
that have the potential to separate the table cursor from the
table selection when clicked on:

1) grid lines (table.getLinesVisible() == true)
2) empty space to the left of the first cell of each row (SWT.FULL_SELECTION)

Expected behaviour:

No matter which part of the table the user clicks on, the
table cursor should follow the table selection as closely as
possible if the selection is changed as a result of the click.

To reproduce the problem, use snippet 96 with an added
table.setLinesVisible(true).

Patch (tested on Windows only)

This new implementation of TableCursor.tableMouseDown first calls
Table.getItem(Point) to find the right item, then checks which
column the given location belongs to, treating a grid line to the
right of a cell as part of its bounds. If this fails, the first column
will be used. If there are no columns, the column will be set to null.
Unless some table widget quirks on other platforms prevent the patch
in comment #2 from working on those platforms, would it be possible
to check it in in time for one of the next milestone releases?
Having just read bug 113105, it seems that the current behaviour of
Table#getItem(Point) (which, as bug 86229 comment #2 says, is intended)
prevents my patch from working for tables without FULL_SELECTION style.

Not sure why anyone would use a table cursor in combination with such
a table, but if it worked in the past then it should continue to do so.
For the time being, please disregard the patch, I'll try to come up with
a new one. Sorry about that.

(On a side note, I /knew/ that there must have been some reason why the
current implementation of TableCursor#tableMouseDown avoided calling
Table#getItem(Point)...)
Created attachment 31913
Updated patch

In the absence of a Table.getItem(Point, boolean) API (-&gt; bug 113105 comment #1)
the best approach I can think of to resolve this bug would be to use the code
from the original patch when FULL_SELECTION is set, thus covering both the trim
area and gridlines, and fall back to the old code when that style is not set.
This at least fixes the most common case.
Ping. Veronika, please let me know if there are any problems with the patch.
I released a variation on this patch.  See below.  I tried to make the non FULL_SELECTION a bit smarter and reuse as much of the same code between the two cases.

Thanks for working on this bug.

However, you've replaced the following lines from my patch:

With this change the column is not set correctly when the user clicks on

    <WithStack>A convention for XML languages is to define a content type that ends in
"+xml", ie "application/voicexml+xml". If one of these is identified the 
default behavior of the JSP editor should be to use text/xml behaviors unless
otherwise defined.

A simple 6-line example of a .jsp file using a simple +xml content type
This seems a small change would get us a long way to supporting more types. 
(without fancy extensions, etc.). 

Phil, would this be a small change in that initializtion code you did?

The code to look at would be:

EmbeddedTypeRegistry#getTypeFor(mimeType)

which returns an embedded type handler. 
The registry could return EmbeddedXML for anything w/ "+xml". 
Currently the registry checks if the mimeType is in any of its
EmbeddedTypeHandler's list of "supportedMimeTypes", then returns that handler.

Instead we might be able to change it to a more flexible call like
"EmbeddedTypeHandler#canHandleMimeType(mimeType)".

Or if we want to better preserve the current behavior, we can default to calling
"canHandleMimeType(mimeType)" only if the type isn't found in the supported mime
type list.
Since the document/partitioner need to be created before the model there's
one other change that would have to be made is in:

StructuredTextPartitionerForJSP#createStructuredTextPartitioner(...)

...

else if (contentType.equalsIgnoreCase(XML_MIME_TYPE) || 
                                               contentType.endsWith("+xml")) {
			result = new StructuredTextPartitionerForXML();
			result.connect(structuredDocument);
		}
...

    <WithOutStack>A convention for XML languages is to define a content type that ends in
"+xml", ie "application/voicexml+xml". If one of these is identified the 
default behavior of the JSP editor should be to use text/xml behaviors unless
otherwise defined.
Created attachment 24891
A simple 6-line example of a .jsp file using a simple +xml content type
This seems a small change would get us a long way to supporting more types. 
(without fancy extensions, etc.). 

Phil, would this be a small change in that initializtion code you did?

The code to look at would be:

EmbeddedTypeRegistry#getTypeFor(mimeType)

which returns an embedded type handler. 
The registry could return EmbeddedXML for anything w/ "+xml". 
Currently the registry checks if the mimeType is in any of its
EmbeddedTypeHandler's list of "supportedMimeTypes", then returns that handler.

Instead we might be able to change it to a more flexible call like
"EmbeddedTypeHandler#canHandleMimeType(mimeType)".

Or if we want to better preserve the current behavior, we can default to calling
"canHandleMimeType(mimeType)" only if the type isn't found in the supported mime
type list.
Since the document/partitioner need to be created before the model there's
one other change that would have to be made is in:

StructuredTextPartitionerForJSP#createStructuredTextPartitioner(...)

...

else if (contentType.equalsIgnoreCase(XML_MIME_TYPE) || 
                                               contentType.endsWith("+xml")) {
			result = new StructuredTextPartitionerForXML();
			result.connect(structuredDocument);
		}
...

Where partitioner for XML is created for contentType ending w/ "+xml".
While this was entered as an "enhancement" by client, I think many end-users
will experience as a "bug" ... and while these other general types will not be
well tested, fixing this at least allows the community to experient with them.

    <WithStack>Currently, if a DTD or XSD is selected in navigator, there is a menu choice for
"generate" which always has just one item. "generate XML", I believe. (pehaps
there's others? generate wsdl? generate jsp?). 

It would be a better, less cluttered, and more consistent UI to simply include 
another item under the "new" menu action, so that if a DTD or XSD was selected,
to allow "new file from dtd" or "new file from xsd" actions. These would do
exactly the same thing as the current "generate" option, but would be a more
consistent, less cluttered approach to "new" things.
Craig, can you get someone to look at coordinating and architecting this "UI"
issue? If not, please reassign to me and I'll see what can be done. 

If you look at a similar paradigm in the Rational based tools (RAD 6.0), yes
they have additional options like: HTML Doc, DTD, Java, DDL, etc.  Though I
agree with you that using a context-sensitive New option would be more natural.

There are some cases (this spans Eclipse subprojects) where these:
new/generate/export/transform concepts are mixed.  For example, to generate an
Ecore/genmodel file from Rose, you need the "New" EMF wizard but to create the
Ecore file from UML2 you do an Export.

Just one persons observations.
David are you envisioning dynamic additions of shortcuts to the New... menu based on selection? Or are you just saying that if user added the New-&gt;XML shortcut to the New menu and clicks New-&gt;XML the wizard should be smart and offer defaults based on the selection (DTD, XSD)?

Gabriel, please clarify the requirement and work with the UI folks to get an oppinion. I am thinking it may be a bit late to change this for WTP 3.0 given all the documentation and downstream adopters implications.

I guess both. It just seems wrong to have the "generate" context menu item, always with one choice (depending on what's selected) ... at least, I've only ever seen one choice. 

And, to me, seems like a "create new" function, so, wondering why we needed a new category in context menu ... but, I'm not aware if any other 'new' items are context sensitive. 

I would appreciate some investigation if UI experts feel this is an Eclipse consistency issue -- or UI Guidelines issue -- but, agree, its getting kind of late and is not an urgent priority. 

As Steve suggests, perhaps this is also a "cross project" issue as well. 
How are "new database tables", "new reporting chart", etc. handled?

    <WithStack>Let say you are building a plugin on top of another library (lets call it 
SleepingBear) - the SleepingBear is undergoing some development, e.g. it 
refactors some internal classes into another new package. 

Now the SleepingBear plugin does and should actually not care about this 
refactoring since its all about internal classes that it never directly uses, 
BUT that is of course not true since when the SleepingBear plugin tries to 
invoke methods in the SleepingBear which depends on these internal classes it 
will get ClassNotFoundExceptions and in some cases that is actually expected 
behavior inside the SleepingBear and thus it falls back to another behavior...
and voila - it affects the behavior of the SleepingBear plugin.

This is something plugin developers can waste hours/days on tracking down until 
they by accident clicks "Add.." under exported packages and sees that a couple 
of new internal packages have been created...

I would really appreciate that the platform team once again considers adding 
back the notion of specifying that a plugin want to exports ALL current and 
future packages from a specific jar. Then when its time to rollout the 
plugindeveloper can restrict its package selection (this could be a warning that 
is shown when exporting a feature/site that contains such declarations)

thank you :)
It is unclear from your description whether you are talking about one or two
plug-ins. I guess it is the latter, because for a plug-in to access its own
classes, you don't have to export anything.
Im talking about the following:

sleepingBear.jar and its other related pure java .jars are bundled up and 
exported in org.sleepingbear.eclipse plugin

Another plugin depends on org.sleepingbear.eclipse


-max
If you are writing a 2.1 style plug-in with the appropriate plugin.xml you will get the type of behavior you want. However this will not have great performance characteristics.
To me the issue being reffered to here is mostly encountered at development time and I believe that the runtime should stay out of this type of business. 

Also note that now PDE does a much better job of indicating things that should not be accessed.

Moving to PDE for resolution.
* has no place in the manifest.mf

As of 3.2M5, PDE has introduced an Organize Manifests wizard which enumerates packages and adds them to the manifest.mf for you.

Also, refactoring/renaming packages now result in correct updating of the manifest.mf to reflect the changes.
These additions are all nice, but does not solve the problem of where a user updates a thirdparty.jar which has a new package which by indirection is used - then it will start failing in very weird ways.

But I guess your answer will then just be to run eclipse in "non-safe" mode...where I would rather have the option of explicitly saying that this lib is simply just a 3rd party lib and whatever package it uses internally I should not be affected by.

(so reopening, just to verify that this what you want)
I am not sure what you mean by "non-safe" mode, nor what this bug has to do with PDE in general anyway..

Moving bug back to Equinox to continue this discussion.
By "non-safe" mode I mean the mode where the package dependencies are simply ignored at runtime. (Can't remember the correct name and if the mode actually still exists, making the package listings a pure build time/verification time issue)
I'm having a hard time understanding the issues here.  Do you have some example plugin projects that we can use to demonstrate the issues?

If packages are truely internal then the developer should never be forced to export the packages.
Its been a while since I created the case - I'll try and create a dummy example.

But until then I'll be more specific about the most recent "accident" I had with this one:

In Hibernate Tools we use the hibernate library. This hibernate library is a jar + a set of other dependencies. I had added them all to my project and exported all the expected public packages. Anyhow everything where working fine and dandy until I updated the hibernate library to a newer release and suddenly weird things started to happening (applications behaved differently than before and sometimes weird ClassNotFound errors occurred).

I finally tracked it down to that in the updated hibernate library a new package had been added (org.hibernate.hql.ast.exec) and this package is completely internal and not ever used from the outside BUT the eclipse classloader prevented classes from this package to load and that is what I'm arguing against.

Why should the classloader prevent this ? The package does not need to be exported at all, but it results in ClassNotFoundException anyway.

Note, the issue only occur if &lt;external plugin&gt; invokes code in &lt;org.hibernate.eclipse&gt; plugin that exports a set of known-packages-at-buildtime for Hibernate.

In this situation the new package content cannot be loaded.

This can happen during development and if users upgrade the libraries which might well occur for 3rd party libs.

Was that better ?
Thanks for taking the time to help us here.  I think the best thing would be to get an example to work with.

Question:
Is the internal package (in your latest example org.hibernate.hql.ast.exec) able to be loaded internally from the bundle which includes hibernate?  Or are you talking about another bundle which depends on your bundle getting CNFEs?
I saw the problem when 

plugin X calls plugin Y which calls code in its bundled hibernate.jar that eventually would load org.hibernate.hql.ast.exec

I did not verify if it was happening if I only used plugin Y.


No fix is planned.  It will break modular boundaries which is never a good thing.  PDE has improved to flag packages which you do not export.
I'm sorry - but the *current* situation breaks modularity since a plugin now has to know about internal package structuring details of its bundled jars.

Since I haven't tried verifying it on 3.3 I'll not reopen this issue now, but will try and create an example of what I mean is bad because it disallows updates for jars/plugins that has no change in their public API (they just changed/added an internal package)


So, in PDE land, we have a compiler preference called, Missing Exported Packages (Preferences-&gt;Plug-in Development-&gt;Compilers-&gt;Plug-ins). By default, this is set to IGNORE. Feel free to set this to ERROR in your project templates to ensure you're never missing an exported package.

Thank you for using PDE :)</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Let say you are building a plugin on top of another library (lets call it 
SleepingBear) - the SleepingBear is undergoing some development, e.g. it 
refactors some internal classes into another new package. 

Now the SleepingBear plugin does and should actually not care about this 
refactoring since its all about internal classes that it never directly uses, 
BUT that is of course not true since when the SleepingBear plugin tries to 
invoke methods in the SleepingBear which depends on these internal classes it 
will get ClassNotFoundExceptions and in some cases that is actually expected 
behavior inside the SleepingBear and thus it falls back to another behavior...
and voila - it affects the behavior of the SleepingBear plugin.

This is something plugin developers can waste hours/days on tracking down until 
they by accident clicks "Add.." under exported packages and sees that a couple 
of new internal packages have been created...

I would really appreciate that the platform team once again considers adding 
back the notion of specifying that a plugin want to exports ALL current and 
future packages from a specific jar. Then when its time to rollout the 
plugindeveloper can restrict its package selection (this could be a warning that 
is shown when exporting a feature/site that contains such declarations)

thank you :)
It is unclear from your description whether you are talking about one or two
plug-ins. I guess it is the latter, because for a plug-in to access its own
classes, you don't have to export anything.
Im talking about the following:

sleepingBear.jar and its other related pure java .jars are bundled up and 
exported in org.sleepingbear.eclipse plugin

Another plugin depends on org.sleepingbear.eclipse


-max
If you are writing a 2.1 style plug-in with the appropriate plugin.xml you will get the type of behavior you want. However this will not have great performance characteristics.
To me the issue being reffered to here is mostly encountered at development time and I believe that the runtime should stay out of this type of business. 

Also note that now PDE does a much better job of indicating things that should not be accessed.

Moving to PDE for resolution.
* has no place in the manifest.mf

As of 3.2M5, PDE has introduced an Organize Manifests wizard which enumerates packages and adds them to the manifest.mf for you.

Also, refactoring/renaming packages now result in correct updating of the manifest.mf to reflect the changes.
These additions are all nice, but does not solve the problem of where a user updates a thirdparty.jar which has a new package which by indirection is used - then it will start failing in very weird ways.

But I guess your answer will then just be to run eclipse in "non-safe" mode...where I would rather have the option of explicitly saying that this lib is simply just a 3rd party lib and whatever package it uses internally I should not be affected by.

(so reopening, just to verify that this what you want)
I am not sure what you mean by "non-safe" mode, nor what this bug has to do with PDE in general anyway..

Moving bug back to Equinox to continue this discussion.
By "non-safe" mode I mean the mode where the package dependencies are simply ignored at runtime. (Can't remember the correct name and if the mode actually still exists, making the package listings a pure build time/verification time issue)
I'm having a hard time understanding the issues here.  Do you have some example plugin projects that we can use to demonstrate the issues?

If packages are truely internal then the developer should never be forced to export the packages.
Its been a while since I created the case - I'll try and create a dummy example.

But until then I'll be more specific about the most recent "accident" I had with this one:

In Hibernate Tools we use the hibernate library. This hibernate library is a jar + a set of other dependencies. I had added them all to my project and exported all the expected public packages. Anyhow everything where working fine and dandy until I updated the hibernate library to a newer release and suddenly weird things started to happening (applications behaved differently than before and sometimes weird ClassNotFound errors occurred).

Note, the issue only occur if &lt;external plugin&gt; invokes code in &lt;org.hibernate.eclipse&gt; plugin that exports a set of known-packages-at-buildtime for Hibernate.

"Swing provides a particularly useful implementation of the Icon interface:
ImageIcon (in the API reference documentation), which paints an icon from a GIF,

*.bmp is not on this list and therefore it does not show up even if it matches
the user defined filter.
Jonathan's correct in that .bmp files are not supported. 
I corrected the script (SwingIconTestCase.htm) by removing this reference and
updated several sentances that have question marks at the end (must be from the

&gt;&gt; Drop the following Swing Containers on to a content pane and verify that an 
image can be added via the various image property and that visual class will 
save without errors.

I was using the visual class created earlier in the scenario.  I noticed that 
adding a JFrame did not give me the usual dialog which prompts for the variable 
name to add to the visual class.  The reason I mention this is because the 
scenario subsequently asks to look at the title bar for the icon to be changed 
and a title bar is only available on a top level window, not a child window.
This same thing occurs for an AWT Frame which is also a top level container.  
Instructions for both of these should state to create a visual class which is 
derived from AWT Frame/Swing JFrame.  JFrame / Frame cannot be inside content 
panel as far as I can tell.

The instructions state this:
# Drop the following Swing Components on to a content pane. And verify that an
image can be added via the icon property and that visual class will save without
errors. And verify  that the source has been updated with code to include the
image upon the swing component:

    * Jbutton
    * JcheckBox
    * JradioButton
    * JtoggleButton
    * Jlabel
    * JOptionPane

JFrame is not in this list.

The instructions then go on to state:

an image can be added via the specific image property and that visual class will
save without errors. And verify that the source has been updated with code to

from the properties.  This should insert the image into the title bar of the jframe.

o        JInternalFrame – Drop a JInternalFrame on to the canvas and select the
frameIcon button  . This should insert the image into the title bar.


Here it is not on the content pane, it is the white canvas.

Maybe the problem is the word "canvas" This means the white surface or what we
call the freeform, which is distinct from "contentPane"</WithStack>

The property to set is 'frameIcon' on the actual JInteralFrame, the content pane
that is a child of the JInternalFrame.
But the wording somewhat confusing for this and the JFrame in that it says to 
"Drop the following Swing Containers on to a content pane and verify that an 
image can be added via the various image property..."

For one thing you can't drop a JFrame onto a content pane, only onto the canvas.

Anyway, to clarify the instructions a bit (hopefully) I changed the script to
read "Drop the following Swing Containers on to the canvas and verify that an
image can be added via the specific image property and that visual class will
save without errors." 
I also highlighted the specific properties to be set (in this case 'frameIcon'
for JInteralFrame) so it will be clear on which property in the property sheet
view to look for.

Could you please review it to see if it meets with your approval? Do you have
any other suggestions for the wording? Here's the link--&gt;

Thanks...

Marco, thanks for the review and suggestion. I updated the script fow dropping
AWT controls (in this case a Frame) onto the canvas to make it more clear.

    <WithOutStack>In executing JVEPROP03 I came across these instructions.

&gt;&gt; Drop the following Swing Containers on to a content pane and verify that an 
image can be added via the various image property and that visual class will 
save without errors.

I was using the visual class created earlier in the scenario.  I noticed that 
adding a JInternalFrame gave me 2 dialogs, one for the content panel and 
another for the internal frame.  Code appeared to be inserted for the content 
panel and for the internal frame but I saw nothing in wither the visual editor 
or running the application.

    <WithStack>We'd like to have warnings about unnecessary Object casting, but also like to be
a bit paranoid about our arithmatic expressions (we like excessive casting
there).  So it would be nice to have an arithmatic or primatives exception to
the unnecessary cast warning option.
Interesting suggestion. What about cast involving autoboxing ?

Integer i = (Integer) 12;
Olivier - this would mean an extra option, #includePrimitiveCast or sthg like this. Would be enabled by default, for backward compatibility.
It is worth mentioning that some casts from primitive types to object types are declared as unnecessary when they are in fact not unnecessary:

    <WithStack>I've seen this a couple of times, here how to reproduce...

Import the 'wsdl' schema file below into your workspace and open it in the XML
editor (or XML Schema editor) : 

&lt;wtp-install-location&gt;\eclipse\plugins\org.wsdl4j_1.4.0\xsd\wsdl.xsd

In the source page, locate the following section :

  &lt;xs:complexType name="tDefinitions" &gt;
  &lt;xs:complexContent&gt;      
      &lt;xs:extension base="wsdl:tExtensibleDocumented" &gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
          &lt;xs:group ref="wsdl:anyTopLevelOptionalElement"  minOccurs="0"  
maxOccurs="unbounded" /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute name="targetNamespace" type="xs:anyURI" use="optional" /&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute name="name" type="xs:NCName" use="optional" /&gt;
    &lt;/xs:extension&gt; 
    &lt;/xs:complexContent&gt;
  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;



Now comment out some tags to produce this...



    &lt;xs:complexType name="tDefinitions" &gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;xs:complexContent&gt;      
      &lt;xs:extension base="wsdl:tExtensibleDocumented" &gt;--&gt;

        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute name="targetNamespace" type="xs:anyURI" use="optional" /&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute name="name" type="xs:NCName" use="optional" /&gt;
&lt;!--      &lt;/xs:extension&gt; 
    &lt;/xs:complexContent&gt;--&gt;
  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;


Notice that the &lt;xs:complexType&gt; element is squiggled even though the document
is well formed.  If we save and reopen the squiggles will be gone ... so seems
like some state isn't getting updated properly as we edit.
Mass transfer from pa to dw. Needs more triage. 

This appears to be fixed now. I'll resolve as fixed.  David any idea what change fixed this?
This is part of a mass update to close out all stale WTP bugs which are in the resolved state without an appropriate targeted version.  If you feel this bug was closed inappropriately, please reopen.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The Debug option does not work for external type generic server configuration.

I configured the JBoss 4.0 as a external type Generic server and started it in
debug mode but cannot debug the applications deployed on that server and also
the status of the server shows as "Started" not "Debugging".

I tried to debug the problem and found an interesting thing. When I stop the
execution during debugging at beginning of the if statement in
ExternalLaunchConfigurationDelegate the server did show the status as
"Debugging" but does not start in debugging mode.

Tim, for you.
What I believe you're seeing is the following: if the remote Java debugging
session is unable to attach to the specified debug port (note: you're server
must start with debugging enabled and be listening on that port), then it will
switch modes from debugging to running and thus display "Started"; you should
see the associated connection error in the log file.

I need to make this debugging connection error more visible to the user.
Created attachment 24982
Patch for *.generic.core

Opens an ErrorDialog when there is a problem launching the remote debugging
session so that it's obvious to the user what happened.
Fixed by the attached patch.
Gorkem: if possible, would be great to get this in for RC2
dropped to HEAD 
Created attachment 25042
Updated patch

Two problems with the previous patch:

1) The error message that was updated somehow got cut off at "...exter" (I
included a \n char in there so I don't know if this might have caused a problem
with the patch application logic)
2) Need to create a new Shell from the workbench display rather than using the
currently active shell as the dialog parent (I think it may be failing now due
to changing the "startBeforePublish" flag to true which results in the publish
dialog shell being the active shell when the error dialog is created).

    <WithStack>I use eclipse3.1 and jdk5.0. I write the code:

when run it , it throws a exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: DESede

	at javax.crypto.KeyGenerator.getInstance(DashoA12275)
	at Skey_DES.main(Skey_DES.java:6)

But when I switch to use jdk1.4 as default jre , there are no problem.
This is a runtime issue, possibly a bug in the JRE itself.
Cannot reproduce on 1.5.0_04.
From reporter:
my system is :

winxp sp2 
jdk1.5.0_02
eclipse3.1 

when i run it in command line , it is no problem . so i don't think this is a
runtime issue.

i attachs two shotsnaps.
Moving to debug for further investigation.

Reporter: can you pls attach snapshots to this bug report directly. Also, do you
still reproduce the issue in Eclipse using latest JDK 1.5 ?
I can't reproduce on 1.4.2_08 or 1.5.0_01. Please try a clean install of 1.5.0.
Unable to reproduce on Apple 1.5.0_02

currently athttp://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-RCP-2/tutorial2.html .
I just wanted to point out that the link "Eclipse Rich Client Platform" in the
References section of Parts 1, 2, and 3 opens up an extra navigation frame when
clicked on. I tried clicking on the link with Firefox 1.0.6 and Internet Explorer 6.
Ewwww, thanks for pointing that out.
Created attachment 28978
Draft of the revised version.

I finally made myself sit down and work on this and came up with the first
draft. Let me know if anything big is missing or wrong with it.
Moving out of the articles inbox -- interested parties please cc yourself.
I've pushed the revised article. Marking as fixed, but if there's a problem with it or any questions you can just add it here.
Seems like there is something missing in the last sentence of the note below plugin.xml part:

"By convention only, package names and ids are lower case and class names"

Nothing critical :-)

I'm waiting for revised part 3 now, great articles anyway.
Good eye, I've fixed the typo. It should have said "...and class names are MixedCase".
Update for 3.1.2
A new version has been published of all three parts.

This has been fixed. It now reads "...class names are Pascal Case".


Why not CamelCase? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase

I never even knew that Pascal Case was a synonym for it until now :-)
Actually that's why it got left blank in the first place, I got distracted looking up the difference between camel case and pascal case. Camel case can mean either ThisCapStyle or thisCapStyle (think 'humps'). Pascal case only means ThisCapStyle.</WithStack>

Is this a big job to update? Is it something that I can help with?
It has to be pretty much rewritten and I'm updating the others to fit better with it too. Other projects have taken me away from it but I hope to get back to it soon.

First draft of new version

I'm still working on it but here's a first draft in case anybody wants to have a look.
A new version has been published of all three parts.
Thanks!  This is great!

I have one problem though.  The note under Menus and Toolbars in part3 says, "See bug x for more information."  What's the bug number?
Fixed reference to "bug x" (should be bug 36968).
OpenViewAction does not exist anymore in 3.2 ?
(In reply to comment #7)
&gt; OpenViewAction does not exist anymore in 3.2 ?

Can you submit a patch?
OpenViewAction is not part of Eclipse; it's a class defined by the RCP Mail template, and it's still used as of 3.3M1. If you look in the zip file that goes with the article you'll find it there too.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Description: Spaces in parameter value entered are trimmed when previewed in 
html.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a ListBox parameter.
2. Import values. 
3. Enter "a" and add to right pane.
4. Enter " a" and add to right pane.
5. Enter "  a" and add to right pane.
6. Preview in html.

Actual result: in drop down list of this parameter, they are all displayed 
as "a".
1) Drop down list is fine.
2) This issue is with default value returned from egnine. Use test case in this
bug, set "  a" as deafult value. The default value returned from engine becomes
""  a"".
Confirmed with submitter, this bug is about drop down list in parameter pane. 
Result of preview is correct. I notice that drop down list in parameter pane 
is not correct while drop down list in "Enter paramters" dialog is correct on 
this test case.
BTW, According to SPEC, the value in selection list of scalar paramter is 
string instead of expression, so we needn't add double quotation marks on a 
constant string. if we set an item in selection list as default value, 
designer will add the quotation marks automatically, because default value is 
an expression.
In eclipse parameter dialog pane, I see no problem in the list.
Note my preview comments, There is a issue with default value returned from
egnine. Use test case in this
bug, set "  a" as deafult value. The default value returned from engine becomes
""  a"".

Please log a seperate bug if necessary.

Please see attached zip file in NewDesignFile4.
The leading blanks are there, but bugzilla upload file trim them. 

Note:Please use zip file to attach design file or some one can find the other 
solution of bugzill.

I think the blanks are there but IE don't show them. Don't open deisng file 
with IE directly, please open them with other editor.
This is a limitation of html option tag. See html content below:

			&lt;OPTION VALUE="&amp;#32;&amp;#32;&amp;#32;a"&gt;"&amp;#32;&amp;#32;&amp;#32;a"&lt;/OPTION&gt;

list values are ok. Space is encoded and perserved. If you choose one of them,
the value will be passed over to engine properly.

No file listed for "*.*" filter when new a flat file data source

steps to reproduce:
1. new a flat file data source and data set.
2. set filter to search "*.*" file as data source


actual result:
No file listed for "*.*" filter when new a flat file data source

expected result:
when set filter to be "*.*" to search file, all the files can be found
The original file filter will attempt to construct a file based on the given 
name, directory and “\” separator. In windows there is no problem but in linux 
the file separator is “/”. Use File.separator instead.

Test Build:20050718
In the original version of SqlDataSetEditorPage, a schema filter will be load 
dynamically depending on the given db when the control is initialized. Once 
the db is shift from not supporting schema to supporting schema, the program 
will try to populate the schema combo box. The combo, however, has not yet 
been initialized because the in original initialization the construction of it 
is excluded.

Change the codes so that the schema combo would be instanced without regarding 
whether it is actually needed or not. If it is not necessary then simply 
disabled it in UI.

Verified Build:20050720</WithStack>

This is likely a dup of bug 94452. Questions:

* what sort of hardware are you using?
* when does the problem occurr (are you showing lots of variables/logical 
structures, etc)?
* if you increase the communication timeout setting in the "Java &gt; Debug" 
preferences, does the problem go away? (say from 3000ms to 5000ms).

As a workaround, you could try the replacement plug-in patch on bug 94452 (3rd 
attachment to the bug).
Sorry for the delay in replying.

My hardware: P4 2.66GHz, 512MB RAM
Problem occurs irrepective of whether I am showing a list of variables or not.
I still get the exception even after increasing communication timeout setting.
I unzipped the attachment from bug 94452 into eclipse directory after removing 
the old org.eclipse.jdt.debug_3.1.0 directory in plugin folder and started 
eclipse. The problem continues to occur even after that. 

Please let me know if you need any further info.

I have an update on this...

I am building an application targeting WAS 3.5 and so am using the following 
java version:
java version "1.2.2"
Classic VM (J2RE 1.2.2 IBM build wn122-20000720 (JIT enabled: jitc))

When using this I am getting the problem.

When I move to the following version, everything is working:
java version "1.5.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0-b64)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0-b64, mixed mode, sharing)

But, I need to debug with IBM java 1.2.2. How do I do that?

thanks.

VM versions 1.2.x do not have JDWP support required for debugging. You can 
copy jdwp.dll and jdwp_g.dll from the bin directory of a 1.3.1 VM to a 1.2.2 
install and hope that debugging works. This worked for me using a Sun VM - not 
sure if it works with IBM VMs. Debugging on 1.2.x is not officially supported 
by Eclipse.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Description: Chinese characters can't be previewed in Eclipse version 3.1 with 
local data source.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a local data source in which there are chinese characters.
2. Preview.

Actual result: you will find "???" is displayed.
I write a test as the following:
public void test1() throws Exception{
	Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");
	Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:test");
	PreparedStatement pStatement = connection.prepareStatement("select * 
from Account");
	ResultSet rs =  pStatement.executeQuery();
	ResultSetMetaData rsdm =  rs.getMetaData();
	while ( rs.next( ) )
	{
		for ( int i = 1; i &lt;= rsdm.getColumnCount( ); i++ )
		{
			System.out.print( rs.getString( i ) + "\t" );
		}
		System.out.print( "\n" );
	}
}
Run it in XP, locale US, language for non-Unicode programs English(US)
The result is:

In the fifth line, what we expect are four chinese characters.
In the case you described, data engine of Birt depends on the data from jdbc, 
so we have nothing to do about it.
I believe it is not a bug of BIRT.

Hmm.  This is very interesting.  For some reason the activitySupport extension point is null.  This should 
never be the case.  I see you have many plug-ins installed... are you also running a modified/patched 
Eclipse base by any chance?
Pascal, do you have any insights here?  Under what circumstances would an extension point we know to 
exist fail to be returned by IExtensionRegistry.getExtensionPoint(...) ?  A casual trot through the code 
makes me think it might be a corrupt table file...

- are you also running a modified/patched 
Eclipse base by any chance?

No I am not. I have downloaded, unzip and started eclipse 3.1. No modifications.
Mo patches.
Just curious is blackdown a supported JRE?
The reporter does not run the latest blackdown BTW.
And the linux in question looks to me like it's a custom build.
And he uses web tools 0.7 which requires GEF &amp; draw2d 3.1 and not 3.01, EMF 2.1
and not EMF 2.0.2 or 2.0.1.
Note also that the install is not straight because the EMF features seems to be
missing too.
Finally it also missing JEM to run WTP.
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drops/S-0.7RC1-200507150303/

This makes for lot of potential problems.
Just my 2 cents.
It is true that I am not using the latest blackdown.
I am working on a custom linux build - I am using Gentoo linux, with kernel 2.6.10.
Part of the plugins are not the latest. Maybe this is the rezson for the error. 
But the problem is that I can not start a runtime workbench.
And in the workbench I want to start the web tools are not included.
This are the plugins I have checked to start with the runtime workbench

I have not included the web tools in the list of plugins to start with the

is this still a problem in Eclipse 3.2 (m5a for example)?
I havent expreriensed any problems using eclipse3.2M5 and M5a
Marking as WORKSFORME. Please reopen if this occurs again.</WithStack>

Hmm.  This is very interesting.  For some reason the activitySupport extension point is null.  This should 
never be the case.  I see you have many plug-ins installed... are you also running a modified/patched 
Eclipse base by any chance?
Pascal, do you have any insights here?  Under what circumstances would an extension point we know to 
exist fail to be returned by IExtensionRegistry.getExtensionPoint(...) ?  A casual trot through the code 
makes me think it might be a corrupt table file...

- are you also running a modified/patched 
Eclipse base by any chance?

No I am not. I have downloaded, unzip and started eclipse 3.1. No modifications.
Mo patches.
Just curious is blackdown a supported JRE?
The reporter does not run the latest blackdown BTW.
And the linux in question looks to me like it's a custom build.
And he uses web tools 0.7 which requires GEF &amp; draw2d 3.1 and not 3.01, EMF 2.1
and not EMF 2.0.2 or 2.0.1.
Note also that the install is not straight because the EMF features seems to be
missing too.
Finally it also missing JEM to run WTP.
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drops/S-0.7RC1-200507150303/

This makes for lot of potential problems.
Just my 2 cents.
It is true that I am not using the latest blackdown.
I am working on a custom linux build - I am using Gentoo linux, with kernel 2.6.10.
Part of the plugins are not the latest. Maybe this is the rezson for the error. 
But the problem is that I can not start a runtime workbench.
And in the workbench I want to start the web tools are not included.
This are the plugins I have checked to start with the runtime workbench

I have not included the web tools in the list of plugins to start with the
runtime workbench.


is this still a problem in Eclipse 3.2 (m5a for example)?
I havent expreriensed any problems using eclipse3.2M5 and M5a
Marking as WORKSFORME. Please reopen if this occurs again.</WithOutStack>

Please Help Me
This scenario is not reproducible in RC1.

There was a defect if you  directly  invoke Create Enterprise Bean Wizard,
and then  choose New "New.." to create a EJB project, 
if this  is what you are doing  then i  suggest to create EJB project  first
and then add Enterprise bean to the project.
I am using WTPM5, Eclipse 3.1, and XDoclet 1.2.3, for ejb generation. And I 
am getting following Exception 
"java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException" 
while trying to create an EJB Project as per the Tutorial which is given at 
http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/testtutorials/M2/ejbtutorial/buildingejbs.html
 So, Please tell me What to do with this 
problem.

Is this the same error, the stack for which you have included?, 
did you use the workaround i mentioned?
At which step are you getting this error?
Yes, First I create the EJB project after that I am try to create an Session 
Bean, But while creating an Ejb project &amp; it's client I am 
getting "java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException" this Exception so please 
tell me what to do to solve this problem, It's very Important for me.
And as said I am following steps given at 
http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/testtutorials/M2/ejbtutorial/buildingejbs.html
  Please Help Me &amp; Suggest me some solution on that

Thanks in Advance

Please Help Me
This scenario is not reproducible in RC1.

There was a defect if you  directly  invoke Create Enterprise Bean Wizard,
and then  choose New "New.." to create a EJB project, 
if this  is what you are doing  then i  suggest to create EJB project  first
and then add Enterprise bean to the project.

This is sticky view behaviour. 

Moving to platform UI to consider the change in sticky view behaviour whereby 
closing of the sticky view in one perspective will affect all the perspective.

Rational:

Sticky views feel like they are 'above' the perspective in that they shift the 
perspective content and persist when perspectives are switched. A mirroring 
behaviour with respect to closing the view would feel more consistent.
I would like this, but it is dependant upon bug 57841.  As it turns out, closing a view in a non-visible 
perspective is really quite tricky.

Nick, feel free to grab this one and the dependent bug if you feel up to a challenge.  ;)

I'm not sure if this is the exact same problem, but sometimes when the
prespective changes automatically to debug or team perspective, the help view
pops up and wont close until eclipse does. Once this happens, I get exceptions
when eclipse shuts down. Error log attached.

    <WithStack>First, thank you for the improvement #59258.

But the implementation has one critical (?) drawback: the files in
&lt;workspace&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/.settings contains platform specific line delimiters.

I shared my settings via Subversion on Windows XP, if I change one setting on
Mac OS, svn recognize changes in all lines. Thus, instead of having just one
changed line, all lines changed.

OK, it is possible to share the settings, but a reliable configuration
management is not possible.
Why .settings is not handled as a text file? In this case, at least on CVS, the
line delimiters are converted when getting the changes.
Check the svn:eol-style property under Subversion. When set to native, this
conversion should be transparent for the user.
Ok to close?
Sorry for any inconveniences and thanks for the hint.

See http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html for further information on
that topic.

    <WithStack>Hi,

We run all our jvms with the following flag

  -Dsun.java2d.noddraw

There is no way to specify this flag to the jvms launched by VE.
This causes VE to crash.

Please provide a way to specify this flag or use all the flags specified to
Eclipse for the VE jvm

Further more - why does VE launch 3 additional jvms in the background ?

Cheers
This is a show stopper for us. Please treat this bug as high priority.
There is a way to specify it.

1) Windows-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;Installed JRE's.
2) Select the jre that you are using, hit "Edit..."
3) Put your arg into the "Default VM Arguments" field.

We have three jvms because:

1) We require one to do introspection for beaninfo.
2) We require one for the VE editor itself to run your editor session.
3) We have a spare sitting around so that when a new one is needed
   it is quickly picked up.

    <WithOutStack>Hi,

We run all our jvms with the following flag

  -Dsun.java2d.noddraw

There is no way to specify this flag to the jvms launched by VE.
This causes VE to crash.

Please provide a way to specify this flag or use all the flags specified to
Eclipse for the VE jvm

Further more - why does VE launch 3 additional jvms in the background ?

Cheers
This is a show stopper for us. Please treat this bug as high priority.
There is a way to specify it.

1) Windows-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;Installed JRE's.
2) Select the jre that you are using, hit "Edit..."
3) Put your arg into the "Default VM Arguments" field.

    <WithStack>the following code doesn't compile with eclipse :

AbstractTest.java:
package test;

public abstract class AbstractTest&lt;Z&gt; {
  
  public abstract MyEnum m(Z z);
  
  public enum MyEnum {
    A,B
  }
}

Test.java:
package test;

import static test.AbstractTest.MyEnum.*;

public class Test extends AbstractTest&lt;String&gt; {
  @Override
  public MyEnum m(String s) {
    return A; // &lt;--- here
  }
}

This corectly compile without the import static or
without the generics.

The infered type of A is AbstractTest&lt;Z&gt;.MyEnum
and not AbstractTest.MyEnum.
It seems that eclipse doesn't considere that
enum {} is a static context (the enum must not
parametrized by Z) in case of static import.

    <WithStack>The printer friendly version of "Eclipse 3.1 - New and Noteworthy"
(http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1-200506271435/eclipse-news-all.html)
contains more items than the parted announcement (eclipse-news-part1.html etc).

E.g. the item "Sharing Java project settings" appears in printer friendly
version in section JDT, but not at eclipse-news-part2.html (the separated JDT
section).

Is that intended?
Reassigning to Platform Doc.
Where do you see a printer-friendly version?  The document linked above
(eclipse-news-all.html) just contains three sections that are linked using tags
within the same document (eclipse-news-all.html#part2 for JDT, etc). Since there
is only one file it must be consistent.  I am looking in the wrong place or has
this been fixed?
Go to http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1-200506271435/

Click on "New and Noteworthy" -&gt;
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1-200506271435/eclipse-news.html

Click on "Printer friendly version covering all of Eclipse." -&gt;
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1-200506271435/eclipse-news-all.html

On that printer-friendly version you'll find a section called "Sharing Java
project settings".

Go back to "New and Noteworthy" -&gt;
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1-200506271435/eclipse-news.html

Try to find the section "Sharing Java project settings" on the pages "Plarform",
"JDT" and "PDE". I had no luck.
When I did the R3.1 N&amp;N, I put the content for each of the sections in separate files, and then hacked an 
ant task that would wrap enough html around the content to produce the two different variants. This 
meant that there was no way to get problems like the one identified in this bug, but required me to do all 
the html editing in plaintext (because the html tools always wanted to "fix" the fragments into complete 
pages).

Adding Dejan to the CC since this sounds like it's at least vaguely related to the "single UA content 
delivery" work he are doing.

    <WithStack>While fixing bug 103767, a conscious choice was made be remove "encodinginfo"
from content models, be cause it did not seem to conceptually belong there, such
information typically being the users preference, and only mattering when saved
(or read). Craig explained part of the historical need for it which we'll have
to put back in some day. For some Schema's or DTD's, if they are written with
certain encodinggs, life shift-jis, and some tags or attributes do indeed use
those characters, then a "generated" XML file might also include those
characters, so to be able to generate it, and save it (without user
intervention) the "best can do" is to assume the same charset as the orignal dtd
or schema. 

Craig and I discuss what I think is the idea way to do this (and still honor the
usres preference in most cases, is to add a check box on generate dialog that
gives the user the choice "use workbench prefernce, use same encoding as dtd, or
use charset xyz (drop down list box).

all content types. 
mass reassignment of my bugs to xml-inbox
Sounds more like an enhancement to me. Feel free to switch it back if it's not.</WithStack>
