Repro:
1. Create a Generic WLS 9.0 server, making sure to modify the setDomainEnv.cmd
script according to bug 103593 in order to enable debug mode.
2. Create a JSP named "testjsp.jsp" (per bug 103874) in the WebContent directory
of a Dynamic Web Project with the Generic WLS 9.0 as the target server.
3. Add a scriptlet such as &lt;% out.println("hello"); %&gt; to the JSP.
4. Set a breakpoint on the line containing the scriptlet.
5. In the Project Explorer, right-click on the JSP and choose "Debug As &gt; Debug
on Server".
6. Choose to switch to Debug Perspective when the dialog appears.

Result: The debugger hits the breakpoint and the editor opens with a "Source not
found." message.
Expected: The debugger hits the breakpoint, the editor opens to "testjsp.jsp"
and indicates the instruction at which the debugger has stopped.

Note: The same scenario works on Tomcat 5.5.
Gorkem: I'm going to look into this a bit more now but do you think this could
be due to differences between TomcatSourcePathComputerDelegate and
GenericServerSourcePathComputerDelegate?
It's most likely that the WebContent folder isn't listed as a
FolderSourceContainer.  The default container for a Java project only provides
the Java build paths, and WebContent is normally not on the build path.
Looks like this is related to logic in the generic server framework level;
assigning to Gorkem per email.
I have done some testing with Jonas and Geronimo and they are working as
expected. The problem exists with WLS only. I now think this is not related to
GenericServerSourcePathComputerDelegate missing something. 
This is not related to server adapter returning deficient source containers. I have done some tracing, WLS prepends jsp_servlet to the generated JSP servlets and as a result source lookup lofigic searches for jsp_servlet\my.jsp for /my.jsp in the source containers and naturally fails. 
I am not sure on how to proceed further in the server adapter to overcome this I am assigning to jst.jsp please let me know if I can do any help.

Sending back to Gorkem.  The JSP component's neither involved in setting up source containers nor paths.

Did you mean WLS is prepending "jsp_servlet." to the classnames it generates (in which case the Generic support might need to support such mangling) or is it writing the wrong source filename or path into the .class file?
Gorkem: assign to me
let me know if I can help.
Thomas just fixed the same problem for our custom WLS adapter; the fix involved the following:

-associating the launchConfigurationType with a custom source locator that extends the JavaSourceLookupDirector
-this custom lookup director contributes a custom ISourceLookupParticipant that extends the JavaSourceLookupParticipant and includes logic to check for and strip off "jsp_servlet\\" from the source name

Although a similar solution could potentially be employed for the generic adapter problem, there are some issues: 

-the generic launchConfigurationTypes are not app-server specific so binding to a source locator that embeds app server-specific logic is a bad solution within the generic server context
-modifying the generic server framework to allow server types to contribute custom source lookup logic would be fairly involved and, even if appropriate for the generic server framework, is out-of-scope for the 1.0 timeframe.

I'm going to differ a decision on this one to you, Gorkem, but my current thinking is that we do one of the following:

-Bind a custom source locator to the external launch config type that includes WLS-specific logic; not a pretty solution but it may be tolerable if WLS ends up being the only generic adapter requiring special treatement (or there are a small number of other cases that can be added to the custom locator as needed)
-Draw the line between generic and custom adapter support on this item (at least for 1.0): only so much functionality can be expected from generic adapters and, for WLS, this is the exactly the type of feature that motivates a custom adapter.

Patch for org.eclipse.jst.server.generic.core

Patch that incorporates Thomas Yip's fix for the WLS JSP debugging src lookup problem: binds a custom extension of JavaSourceLookupDirector (performs WLS-specific modifications to src names) to the "external" launch configuration type (currently used just by the WLS generic servers)

I haven't been able to verify this patch.
I used it to enhance org.eclipse.jst.server.generic.core_1.0.0.jar

   plugin.properties
   plugin.xml
   org\eclipse\jst\server\generic\core\internal\GenericSourceLookupDirector$JspSourceLookupParticipant.class
   org\eclipse\jst\server\generic\core\internal\GenericSourceLookupDirector.class

and replaced with it, the old one. 


However when debugging the JSP, I get the old error
  Source not found
  Edit Source Lookup Path.


Ivan, in doing this "hand patch" ... did you restart with -clean? 

BTW, I think there was a a related patch needed in JSP plugin. 
see bug 103874. 


Ivan: just tried things w/ the jar you sent along and it's not working, however,  it does work for me when I launch Eclipse with my workspace version of org.eclipse.jst.server.generic.core (the one I used to create the patch)

Regarding the fix to org.eclipse.jst.jsp.ui: you should only need that if your JSP is nested inside another folder inside WebContent, however, I think you were having issues w/ a non-nested JSP.

I'll dig around a bit more...
Update with 1.5.1 build (200607272136): This repros with the new generic WLS 9.2 server adapter, as well as the generic WLS 9.0 adapter.
Thanks for the update, Beck. 

Gorkem, sending this along your way since I'd like your input on the required changes here (see comment #9). The current fix requires non-ideal changes to the generic framework (i.e. necessitates binding a WLS-specific source locator to the external launch configuration type).

Until it is feasible to allow generic server types to contribute source locators, I think it is OK in this context to resolve this as "won't fix": only so much functionality is possible with generic servers and, given the special requirements for WLS in this area, full JSP debugging with the generic WLS adapter is not supported.

Note: I had further follow-up coversations with Ivan and he was able to resolve the issue successfully with the patches.
Reassigning this one to Danny since he has some good thoughts about an alternative approach that would fix the issue without impacting the core generic server code.
The alternative approach is to programmaticly add sourceLookupParticipant
in a custom server behavior class, instead of bind Weblogic custom source lookup 
director to generic launchConfigurationType:

(1) have the generic class ExternalServerBehaviour expose a protected method: 
	protected void setupSourceLocator(ILaunch launch) {}
which subclass can override and add additional sourceLookupParticipant.

(2) Weblogic server adapter will have its own ServerBehaviourDelegate,
GenericWeblogicServerBehaviour, which provides a custom sourceLookupParticipant
strip off "jsp_servlet\\" from the source name during source lookup.

Rob, can you review the patch above and what is the process to get it into the build?
yep, I'll give it a look and, assuming everything looks good, commit it HEAD
generic.core patch looks OK. I have committed generic.core patch to the HEAD. just let me know when you are ready to release.
Things look good, Danny; thanks for looking into this one.

Gorkem, I've committed the generic.weblogic changes (along with a small change to GenericServer that fixes the getModuleRootURL() logic for ports different than 80; was adding the numeric value for ':' to the port in that case)

So, go ahead and release the changes to both generic.core and generic.weblogic when you're ready
released
Closing as part of mass query to clean up old resolved bugs in untargetted milestones.
This is pretty important patch, however it has incorrect version number. Actually the bug is solved in 2.x series...

Is there any possibility to backport it to 1.5?
No plans to backport that to 1.5 since the 1.5.x branches are are effectively shutdown now. Future work on the the WLS adapters is now being done via the downloadable versions; if/when possible, you should upgrade to WTP 2.0 and install the downloadable WLS server adapters.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>There are two related parts to this enhancement request.

1. Currently the URI resolver framework chains resolvers, calling every resolver
in the chain and passing in the result from the previous resolver. For example,
if I defined extension resolvers A, B, and C, the framework will run A, send the
result of A to B, run B, send the result of B to C, run C, and send the result
of C back to the caller. This strategy does not allow consistentcy amoung
resolvers. When a resolver is called, it may get the input as specified by the
caller or it may get a resolved result from another resolver. Of more
importance, from what I have seen extension resolvers typlically stand alone,
meaning the result of one resolver is of no interest to another resolver.

I suggest the resolver chaining mechanism be changed to return the first result
located. This solves the first problem mentioned above and should have a
positive performance impact as unnecessary additional resolvers will no longer
be run.

2. The URI resolver framework currently has two stages: prenormalization and
postnormalization. These two stages pose a problem for extension resolvers the
specify a priority. A postnormalization resolver with a high priority will
always be run after a prenormalization resolver with a low priority. The type of
input a resolver requires should not dictate the order in which it is run.

I suggest that the normalize method be called to create both prenormalized and
post normalized inputs that can then be passed to the resolvers depending on the
type of input they require.
A secondary requirement of this change is that extension resolvers return a
common result when they are unable to resolve the resource. For simplicity I
will suggest that they return null. This is open for discussion.

Patch that removes pre/postnormalization stages

This patch:
1. removes the pre/post normalization stages
2. changes the framework chaining to return the first result returned from a
resolver
3. changes the framework to expect a null return value from resolvers that
cannot resolve a given URI
Lawrence, your original comment said "...that the normalize method be called to
create both prenormalized and post normalized inputs..".  If this wasn't a typo
I strongly disagree.  For taglibs the input must be passed to the extension
as-is or lookups can fail.
Nitin, I guess my comment was unclear. What I am suggesting is that the input be
normalized before a resolver is called but that the original input be maintained
as well. So we'll have,

String input;
String normalizedInput;

A resolver will either receive the input or the normalizedInput depending on
whether it is declared as a prenormalization or postnormalization resolver.

In your case, the taglibs will receive the input "as-is".</WithStack>

The string does not appear to be translated for zh_TW.

Look in:
org.eclipse.wst.css.ui.nl1
 org.eclipse.wst.css.ui.internal.CSSUIPluginResources_zh_TW.properties

the following needs to be translated:
  NewCSSTemplatesWizardPage_2=Name
   
Oh ... who should owner be if "needs translation" is the issue? 

Or should this be closed as "worksforme"?

During TVT (i.e. before the eclipse open source project owns the translations) 
we typically provide the pointer to the string as you have done and close the 
bug as invalid because there is no error in the component at that time.  If a 
string makes it all the way through the process untranslated or with an 
improper translation and a bug is created after the component has taken 
ownership of the translations (post IBM contribution to the eclipse foundation 
of the translations) the bug remains open and is resolved as fixed once an 
updated set of fragments are available.  Typically in this case it is left in 
the affected component and the owner is set to Cam.

Excellent, thanks Steve.

    <WithStack>The Property View uses a Tree with the FULL_SELECTION style bit on. If you left-
click anyhere the entry gets selected. However, if you RIGHT-click then the 
selection only occurs if you are over the rightmost label's text.

To repro:

Open the Property View
Select a file in the Package Explorer / Navigator
Left click to select a row
Right click on some other row (outside the label text)...no sel change.

In this particular case it is causing at least one defect (Bug 103547) to occur 
in the Property View...
Here is an SWT snippet:

public static void main(String[] a) {
    Display display = new Display ();
    Shell shell = new Shell (display);
    shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
   
    Table table = new Table(shell, SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.FULL_SELECTION);

Not sure we should fix this.  We are using TVS_FULLROWSELECT and this is what 
Windows is doing (even though it is unwanted).

    <WithStack>This is a defect for all of the test suites owned by the Monitoring Project.

Refactor the TPTP test suite so that the name of the test suite contains the
name of the bugzilla component because this will make tracking test status
easier. When the test reports are generated, the names of the bugzilla
components must be in the report instead of descriptive names. The list of tests
in the report can then be compared to the list of bugzilla components
and any missing test cases will be identified by the Project lead.

Paul recommended that we refactor at the directory level as well for containment
and use the bugzilla component as an additional name space.  

If the test suite contains several functions, you can either use the bugzilla
component name as the name of the test suite or use the bugzilla component as a
prefix, e.g. Platform.Communication_AC and Platform.Communication_RAC to show
test results for both the new agent controller and the existing agent controller. 

Migrating existing test suites:
   1. When the existing test suite contains tests for a single bugzilla
component, just rename the test suite.
	e.g. "Java Profiler" -&gt; Platform.Agents.JVMPI
   2. For cases where the test suite contains tests for multiple bugzilla
components, but the test cases for each component are not shared, then split
that test suite into several, each named according to their bugzilla component.
   3. If multiple test suites provide tests for the same bugzilla component,
merge those tests into one, or into several that are prefixed by the name of the
bugzilla component as explained above.
	e.g. new Symptom DB, import Symptom DB
		If keeping the test suites as multiple suites =&gt; Monitor.UI.SDBEditor_new
Symptom DB, Monitor.UI.SDBEditor_import Symptom DB
		If merging the test suite into a single suite =&gt; Monitor.UI.SDBEditor
   4. If a test suite contains tests for multiple bugzilla components, and the
test cases are used by more than one component, then choose a bugzilla component
to own the test suite. 
	4.1 Create a test suite for that owner component. 
	4.2 For the other bugzilla components, create a test suite and nest the owner
test suite inside to indicate that this test suite depends on the owner test suite. 
   5. In the case when a test suite contains both shared tests and tests that
are not shared, choose an owner bugzilla component for the common tests and
create a test suite for it. Create a separate test suite for the tests that are
not shared. The not-shared suite should nest the common test suite inside to
show that it depends on the common test suite.

Note that the refactoring operation may be a problem since there is an
outstanding defect for renaming test suites
(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83087).

6. Update the the zip file with the ResourceContents test suite inside of
Eclipse (hit F5 to refresh).
7. Open up the "AllTests.testsuite" that is in the grandparent directory. Go to
the Behavior tab, remove the invocation to the old test suite (ABC -
invocation). Insert &gt; Invocation &gt; browse to the new test suite. Save the editor.
8. In the cases where there are other test suites that link to ABC.testsuite,
those also have to be changed, using the same technique as in #7.
9. Delete the ABC.testsuite from CVS, add the BugzillaComponent.testsuite into
CVS, and update the AllTests.testsuite in CVS. 

-Moving test suites-
1. Create a brand new test suite. (Follow the instructions in README.txt.)

2. Manually copy the test cases from the old test suite into the new test suite.
3. Follow #7, #8, and #9.

-Splitting test suites or merging test suites-
If you need to split up tests amongst test suites, then create several new test
suites and add the appropriate tests. Similarly for merging test suites, create
a single new test suite and add the test cases from the old test suites into the
new.

6. Update the the zip file with the ResourceContents test suite inside of
Eclipse (hit F5 to refresh).
7. Open up the "AllTests.testsuite" that is in the grandparent directory. Go to
the Behavior tab, remove the invocation to the old test suite (ABC -
invocation). Insert &gt; Invocation &gt; browse to the new test suite. Save the editor.
8. In the cases where there are other test suites that link to ABC.testsuite,
those also have to be changed, using the same technique as in #7.
9. Delete the ABC.testsuite from CVS, add the BugzillaComponent.testsuite into
CVS, and update the AllTests.testsuite in CVS. 

-Moving test suites-
1. Create a brand new test suite. (Follow the instructions in README.txt.)
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/test-results/platform/org.eclipse.hyades.tests/README.txt?rev=HEAD&amp;cvsroot=TPTP_Project&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

2. Manually copy the test cases from the old test suite into the new test suite.
3. Follow #7, #8, and #9.

-Splitting test suites or merging test suites-
If you need to split up tests amongst test suites, then create several new test
suites and add the appropriate tests. Similarly for merging test suites, create
a single new test suite and add the test cases from the old test suites into the
new.

Testsuites have been refactored for the following components:

Platform.UI
Platform.UI.LogView
Platform.UI.ProbeEditor
Platform.UI.ProfilingPerspective
Platform.UI.SequenceDiagram

Monitor.UI
Monitor.UI.GLARules
Monitor.UI.SDBEditor

Trace.UI
Moving it to I2.
Test suite renaming is done.
As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant enhancements/defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed. If this enhancement/defect is still unresolved and reproducible in the latest TPTP release (http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/), please re-open.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>This is a defect for all of the test suites owned by the Platform Project.

Refactor the TPTP test suite so that the name of the test suite contains the
name of the bugzilla component because this will make tracking test status
easier. When the test reports are generated, the names of the bugzilla
components must be in the report instead of descriptive names. The list of tests
in the report can then be compared to the list of bugzilla components
and any missing test cases will be identified by the Project lead.

Paul recommended that we refactor at the directory level as well for containment
and use the bugzilla component as an additional name space.  

If the test suite contains several functions, you can either use the bugzilla
component name as the name of the test suite or use the bugzilla component as a
prefix, e.g. Platform.Communication_AC and Platform.Communication_RAC to show
test results for both the new agent controller and the existing agent controller. 

Migrating existing test suites:
   1. When the existing test suite contains tests for a single bugzilla
component, just rename the test suite.
	e.g. "Java Profiler" -&gt; Platform.Agents.JVMPI
   2. For cases where the test suite contains tests for multiple bugzilla
components, but the test cases for each component are not shared, then split
that test suite into several, each named according to their bugzilla component.
   3. If multiple test suites provide tests for the same bugzilla component,
merge those tests into one, or into several that are prefixed by the name of the
bugzilla component as explained above.
	e.g. new Symptom DB, import Symptom DB
		If keeping the test suites as multiple suites =&gt; Monitor.UI.SDBEditor_new
Symptom DB, Monitor.UI.SDBEditor_import Symptom DB
		If merging the test suite into a single suite =&gt; Monitor.UI.SDBEditor
   4. If a test suite contains tests for multiple bugzilla components, and the
test cases are used by more than one component, then choose a bugzilla component
to own the test suite. 
	4.1 Create a test suite for that owner component. 
	4.2 For the other bugzilla components, create a test suite and nest the owner
test suite inside to indicate that this test suite depends on the owner test suite. 
   5. In the case when a test suite contains both shared tests and tests that
are not shared, choose an owner bugzilla component for the common tests and
create a test suite for it. Create a separate test suite for the tests that are
not shared. The not-shared suite should nest the common test suite inside to
show that it depends on the common test suite.

Note that the refactoring operation may be a problem since there is an
outstanding defect for renaming test suites
(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83087).
As per AG discussion on 8/5/05, this should be done in 4.1I1 prior to 
reporting test pass results.
-Rename test suites-
1. Rename the actual ".testsuite" file. (Open the "Navigator" view, right click,
"Rename", change the name from "ABC.testsuite" to "BugzillaComponent.testsuite"). 
2. Open the Test Perspective. Open the test suite by double-clicking on it.
Change the "Name" and "Description" to reflect the new name.
3. Open the .testsuite file with WinZip (right-click, Open With, System Editor &gt;
Winzip).
4. Open the ResourceContents file in Notepad. (Double-click in WinZip.)
5. Rename "ABC" to "BugzillaComponent" on the "name" attribute of the "behavior"
element from ABC_behavior to BugzillaComponent_behavior. 
6. Update the the zip file with the ResourceContents test suite inside of
Eclipse (hit F5 to refresh).
7. Open up the "AllTests.testsuite" that is in the grandparent directory. Go to
the Behavior tab, remove the invocation to the old test suite (ABC -
invocation). Insert &gt; Invocation &gt; browse to the new test suite. Save the editor.
8. In the cases where there are other test suites that link to ABC.testsuite,
those also have to be changed, using the same technique as in #7.
9. Delete the ABC.testsuite from CVS, add the BugzillaComponent.testsuite into
CVS, and update the AllTests.testsuite in CVS.

http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/test-results/platform/org.eclipse.hyades.tests/README.txt?rev=HEAD&amp;cvsroot=TPTP_Project&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

2. Manually copy the test cases from the old test suite into the new test suite.
3. Follow #7, #8, and #9.

    <WithStack>This is a defect for all of the test suites owned by the Trace Project.

Refactor the TPTP test suite so that the name of the test suite contains the
name of the bugzilla component because this will make tracking test status
easier. When the test reports are generated, the names of the bugzilla
components must be in the report instead of descriptive names. The list of tests
in the report can then be compared to the list of bugzilla components
and any missing test cases will be identified by the Project lead.

Paul recommended that we refactor at the directory level as well for containment
and use the bugzilla component as an additional name space.  

If the test suite contains several functions, you can either use the bugzilla
component name as the name of the test suite or use the bugzilla component as a
prefix, e.g. Platform.Communication_AC and Platform.Communication_RAC to show
test results for both the new agent controller and the existing agent controller. 

Migrating existing test suites:
   1. When the existing test suite contains tests for a single bugzilla
component, just rename the test suite.
	e.g. "Java Profiler" -&gt; Platform.Agents.JVMPI
   2. For cases where the test suite contains tests for multiple bugzilla
components, but the test cases for each component are not shared, then split
that test suite into several, each named according to their bugzilla component.
   3. If multiple test suites provide tests for the same bugzilla component,
merge those tests into one, or into several that are prefixed by the name of the
bugzilla component as explained above.
	e.g. new Symptom DB, import Symptom DB
		If keeping the test suites as multiple suites =&gt; Monitor.UI.SDBEditor_new
Symptom DB, Monitor.UI.SDBEditor_import Symptom DB
		If merging the test suite into a single suite =&gt; Monitor.UI.SDBEditor
   4. If a test suite contains tests for multiple bugzilla components, and the
test cases are used by more than one component, then choose a bugzilla component
to own the test suite. 
	4.1 Create a test suite for that owner component. 
	4.2 For the other bugzilla components, create a test suite and nest the owner
test suite inside to indicate that this test suite depends on the owner test suite. 
   5. In the case when a test suite contains both shared tests and tests that
are not shared, choose an owner bugzilla component for the common tests and
create a test suite for it. Create a separate test suite for the tests that are
not shared. The not-shared suite should nest the common test suite inside to
show that it depends on the common test suite.

Note that the refactoring operation may be a problem since there is an
outstanding defect for renaming test suites
(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83087).
-Rename test suites-
1. Rename the actual ".testsuite" file. (Open the "Navigator" view, right click,
"Rename", change the name from "ABC.testsuite" to "BugzillaComponent.testsuite"). 
2. Open the Test Perspective. Open the test suite by double-clicking on it.
Change the "Name" and "Description" to reflect the new name.
3. Open the .testsuite file with WinZip (right-click, Open With, System Editor &gt;
Winzip).
4. Open the ResourceContents file in Notepad. (Double-click in WinZip.)
5. Rename "ABC" to "BugzillaComponent" on the "name" attribute of the "behavior"
element from ABC_behavior to BugzillaComponent_behavior. 
6. Update the the zip file with the ResourceContents test suite inside of
Eclipse (hit F5 to refresh).
7. Open up the "AllTests.testsuite" that is in the grandparent directory. Go to
the Behavior tab, remove the invocation to the old test suite (ABC -
invocation). Insert &gt; Invocation &gt; browse to the new test suite. Save the editor.
8. In the cases where there are other test suites that link to ABC.testsuite,
those also have to be changed, using the same technique as in #7.
9. Delete the ABC.testsuite from CVS, add the BugzillaComponent.testsuite into
CVS, and update the AllTests.testsuite in CVS. 

-Moving test suites-
1. Create a brand new test suite. (Follow the instructions in README.txt.)
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/test-results/platform/org.eclipse.hyades.tests/README.txt?rev=HEAD&amp;cvsroot=TPTP_Project&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

2. Manually copy the test cases from the old test suite into the new test suite.
3. Follow #7, #8, and #9.

-Splitting test suites or merging test suites-
If you need to split up tests amongst test suites, then create several new test
suites and add the appropriate tests. Similarly for merging test suites, create
a single new test suite and add the test cases from the old test suites into the
new.

    <WithStack>I'm not sure which component handles validation of web.xml and ejb-jar.xml
files, so I'm opening the bug here. Please feel free to move it.

When I'm using RC1 and not connected to the internet, errors appear against the
DD files. There are two problems:

1) The error description is just "java.sun.com" and doesn't tell the user what
the actual problem is. (can't connect to internet to validate against the schema)

2) Not being able to validate a DD should not be an error. In my case, the files
were correct (they were the initial ones generated from our project creation
wizards), so showing an error message was pretty user un-friendly. At most this
should have been a warning, and even then it's a little ugly. In my case, I
would prefer to have never seen this message at all - it should almost be a
preference.
Should be resolved with the new caching scheme
I don't mean to play "hot potato" but I think you missed part of the
significance of Tim's comments, Chuck. Mainly, if the schema is not available
(either because no net work, or because not yet cached (and, don't forget,
caching can be set off), then at most there should be a warning that "schema
could not be loaded" ... which, I believe is what the XML Validator does ... is
there other "validation" you are doing, or forcing that had a stronger requirement? 

If not, please return to me, and we'll investigate xml validator further. I
suspect main xml validator bug here is the "java.sun.com" part, 
described in Bug 104454. 

Chuck, do your web and ejb validators call the xml validator explcitly? Is there
mulitiple validation going on in that case?

I'll pipe in now. The XML validator is probably the one producing these
messages. Several problems with disconnected validation have been brought to
light recently. These types of problems are difficult for the XML validator to
diagnose at this point as the problem may be that the file cannot be located
because there is no internet connection or because the file does not exist.
Currently Xerces handles many of the network connections and the associated errors.

Tim, you suggested two possible solutions.
1) Show a warning message that says the file cannot be validated because a
specific resource cannot be located.
2) Do not show any warning or error when the file can't be validated because a
remote resource is unavailable.

I think a combination or 1 and 2 will work best. Show warning messages if there
is no internet connection but have a preference to turn off the warning messages. 

Comments?

I'll need to investigate to see how I can override the Xerces network resolution
and determine that a network connection is not present.

I'm going to wait for Chuck to respond about the EJB and Web validators before
taking ownership of this bug.
Thanks Lawrence, I'll pipe in on the warning ... I think should always be a
warning since 1) it might be invalid we do not know (just one per resource,
though, not other warnings/errors on that file), and 2) users can turn off
warnings already in preferences, so not worth adding prefernce clutter. 

I agree with keeping preference clutter to a minimum. We can go with no
preference unless a specific requirement emerges.
Our validators don't invoke the XML validation  (they run seperatly).
And concentrate on aspects not covered by the basic schema validation.

I have also seen this, and a warning is appropriate - I agree with David, we
should avoid the pref.

Patch that fixes the IOException error messages and addresses a possible infinite loop.

This patch incorporates a fix from Nitin's patch.

I've changed the following errors to warnings. Tim's reported problem is fixed
by the first message.

Unable to connect to host: "{0}". -&gt;
The file cannot be validated as the host "{0}" is currently unreachable.

File not found: "{0}". -&gt;
The file cannot be validated as the XML Schema "{0}" that is specified as
describing the syntax of the file cannot be located.

Connection problem: connect
The file cannot be validated as there was a connection problem.
I should add that the fix does not handle 2.4 deployment descriptors. These
descriptors reference a J2EE schema. A warning is produced when the schema
cannot be read but the files are declared invalid as a definition for the root
element cannot be located. The error message in this case is more informative
but should probably not be displayed if the schema cannot be located. 

The fix for the 2.4 deployment descriptor is a higher risk as it will probably
involve a larger change to the validator. At this point I think the fix for the
messages Tim has pointed out as well as the fix for the possible infinite loop
Nitin has provided a patch for should be addressed. I will continue to work on a
solution for the 2.4 deployment descriptor.
Nitin and Tim, if you're satisfied with the proposed fix as is I will request
approval from the PMC for 0.7. Please take a look ASAP. 

Thanks.
Yup, I'm satisfied with the proposed patch.

    <WithOutStack>I'm not sure which component handles validation of web.xml and ejb-jar.xml
files, so I'm opening the bug here. Please feel free to move it.

When I'm using RC1 and not connected to the internet, errors appear against the
DD files. There are two problems:

1) The error description is just "java.sun.com" and doesn't tell the user what
the actual problem is. (can't connect to internet to validate against the schema)

2) Not being able to validate a DD should not be an error. In my case, the files
were correct (they were the initial ones generated from our project creation
wizards), so showing an error message was pretty user un-friendly. At most this
should have been a warning, and even then it's a little ugly. In my case, I
would prefer to have never seen this message at all - it should almost be a
preference.
Should be resolved with the new caching scheme
I don't mean to play "hot potato" but I think you missed part of the
significance of Tim's comments, Chuck. Mainly, if the schema is not available
(either because no net work, or because not yet cached (and, don't forget,
caching can be set off), then at most there should be a warning that "schema
could not be loaded" ... which, I believe is what the XML Validator does ... is
there other "validation" you are doing, or forcing that had a stronger requirement? 

If not, please return to me, and we'll investigate xml validator further. I
suspect main xml validator bug here is the "java.sun.com" part, 
described in Bug 104454. 

Chuck, do your web and ejb validators call the xml validator explcitly? Is there
mulitiple validation going on in that case?

I'll pipe in now. The XML validator is probably the one producing these
messages. Several problems with disconnected validation have been brought to
light recently. These types of problems are difficult for the XML validator to
diagnose at this point as the problem may be that the file cannot be located
because there is no internet connection or because the file does not exist.
Currently Xerces handles many of the network connections and the associated errors.

Tim, you suggested two possible solutions.
1) Show a warning message that says the file cannot be validated because a
specific resource cannot be located.
2) Do not show any warning or error when the file can't be validated because a
remote resource is unavailable.

I think a combination or 1 and 2 will work best. Show warning messages if there
is no internet connection but have a preference to turn off the warning messages. 

Comments?

I'll need to investigate to see how I can override the Xerces network resolution
and determine that a network connection is not present.

I'm going to wait for Chuck to respond about the EJB and Web validators before
taking ownership of this bug.
Thanks Lawrence, I'll pipe in on the warning ... I think should always be a
warning since 1) it might be invalid we do not know (just one per resource,
though, not other warnings/errors on that file), and 2) users can turn off
warnings already in preferences, so not worth adding prefernce clutter. 

I agree with keeping preference clutter to a minimum. We can go with no
preference unless a specific requirement emerges.
Our validators don't invoke the XML validation  (they run seperatly).
And concentrate on aspects not covered by the basic schema validation.

I have also seen this, and a warning is appropriate - I agree with David, we
should avoid the pref.

Patch that fixes the IOException error messages and addresses a possible infinite loop.

This patch incorporates a fix from Nitin's patch.

I've changed the following errors to warnings. Tim's reported problem is fixed
by the first message.

Unable to connect to host: "{0}". -&gt;
The file cannot be validated as the host "{0}" is currently unreachable.

File not found: "{0}". -&gt;
The file cannot be validated as the XML Schema "{0}" that is specified as
describing the syntax of the file cannot be located.

Connection problem: connect
The file cannot be validated as there was a connection problem.
I should add that the fix does not handle 2.4 deployment descriptors. These
descriptors reference a J2EE schema. A warning is produced when the schema
cannot be read but the files are declared invalid as a definition for the root
element cannot be located. The error message in this case is more informative
but should probably not be displayed if the schema cannot be located. 

The fix for the 2.4 deployment descriptor is a higher risk as it will probably
involve a larger change to the validator. At this point I think the fix for the
messages Tim has pointed out as well as the fix for the possible infinite loop
Nitin has provided a patch for should be addressed. I will continue to work on a
solution for the 2.4 deployment descriptor.

    <WithStack>If an EL region appears in an "arbitrary" text node, and content assist
requested there, a nasty error dialog pops up about a null pointer comes up. 

Looking at the code, this was basically due to an assumption that a (dom) text
node is always one structured document region. 

This main fix, to avoid the NPE is pretty simple, which is to get the region
directly from the document, instead of the DOM. I beleive this is a "contaner
region" so that would have to be interated through to work correctly for EL
regions in text nodes. 

In fact, this still doesn't fix content assist there, since we are also checking
to see if its an "attribtute value region". But, since I'm not sure what other
work/assumptions are being made ... or will need to be made ... to get this to
work correctly, I will just avoid the NPE for now, for RC2. The functional
enhancement can some later.
Ted, I've committed changes that fix the NPE to HEAD, but won't release 
for build until you review and confirm agreement. 

Please see

JSPELContentAssistProcessor.java 
revision 1.3

(And, actually, I'm having trouble confirming CA still works with your latest 
EL parser changes ... I'll take a closer look later). 

Thanks. 
Start with pageContext. I've turned off completion on the maps due to lack of 
interesting use cases.

Could you let me know what you changed?  It looks like you did the reformat 
trick so I'm having a hard time picking out the change in the diff.

IDOMNode xNode = null;
IStructuredDocumentRegion flat = null;

I could get content assist to work if I put in whole word "pageContext" ... 
I thought there was more than that (such as complete 'pageContext' itself. 


The change you've made looks fine.  I'm still getting the hang of the right way 
to do document traversals.

As an aside, the java source compare showed 20 or so changes.

Right now we complete on pageContext members and taglib functions.  We should 
be able to add contect variables without too much problem.  I will open a bug 
for that.

first patch
Hey Jeff,

I made the code adhere to our conventions, cleaned it up, and committed it. 
Also, note that I put up instructions for a convenient way to work with AJDT 
installed: http://eclipse.org/mylar/dev.html

I had to remove most of the extension points in plugin.xml because these 
should not duplicate the ones in mylar.java.  Those extensions will run with 
AspectJ around since the mylar.java plug-in will be loaded.

Let me know if you have any questions about what's been done so far.  Also, 
note that the plug-in is not starting up right now.  I know how to fix that, 
but first wanted to check why you had two different plug-in classes.
In light of the fact that the core org.eclipse.mylar.java stuff moslty works for
AJDT (e.g. Package Explorer and Outline filtering) I think that the first thing
to do to make progress on this task is for us to Outline the things that don't
work.  Ideally that would be done in conjunction with a user interested in using
Mylar with AJDT, so I'll see if I can solicit someone.  
I would like this report to be a discussion of what it means for Mylar to
support AJDT well, and then have specific tasks become seperate reports.  Thanks
to AJDT's increasing compatability with the JDT's Java Model the Mylar Java
stuff already goes part of the way to supporting AJDT.  What we need now is
someone interested in using both to outline and prioritize the key things that
don't work well (e.g. wanting the mylar glasses for the xref view).  

Matt, Ron, and Ramnivas, I have added you to this report in case you are
interested in trying the Mylar UI and commenting.  There's a 5 minute tutorial
video at: http://eclipse.org/mylar/doc/demo/mylar-demo-03.html  If you have not
made it to Phase 1 of the user study email mylar@cs.ubc.ca to get the update site.
Any bad interactions between Mylar and AJDT should now be made seperate bug reports.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If javadoc warnings for the scope protected and above are enabled, there should
be  no missing comment warnings for any members of a member with a visibility
less than protected.

E.g. 

public class A {
  private class Bla extends AbstractAction {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
      ...
    }
  }
}

There should be no "missing javadoc" warning, since the whole class will never
get into the javadoc because of private visibility... So pretty sensless to
issue a warning and especially if one uses a lot of inner/anonymous classes this
is more than annoying. And because of the bunch of warnings I've seen a lot of
people starting to ignore/filter out or even disable those warnings. And thus
finally makes the complete warning system superfluous or at least to degrade its
usage to not production ready ...
Moving to JDT/Core. 


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 86769 ***
It might be a duplicate, but 86769  has been marked as resolved, which isn't
true ...
It's *really* a duplicate.
Bug 86769 was marked as RESOLVED but status was LATER. That means bugs is NOT
resolved but will be fixed later...
This is the way bugzilla works. If you think this behavior is not good, please
open a requirement against it...

patch 1 of 1
The attached patch is ready to be committed. I realize it's likely too late to 
get this into 0.7 but since the fix is so simple and low risk, I decided to 
attach the patch anyway. The problem is that ClientRuntimeSelectionWidget is 
not calling the right getter on ProjectSelectionWidget to get the project name 
and ear project name for validation purposes. Instead, it's calling a getter 
that really should be removed entirely from the class since it does not return 
the currently selected value of these fields but rather what they were when the 
page initially came up. I'd like for this to be in 0.7 because it's a pretty 
fundamental problem with page 3 validation (client wizard only), could be very 
annoying and limiting to users, and the fix is extremely low risk.
I've reviewed the fix and, its simplicity weighed against the prospect of 
blocking users who have more than one type of server, something that would not 
seem uncommon, agree we should pull this into RC2. Committed and released, 
v20050719_1900.

    <WithStack>Debug a program having 2 threads with register view open, the program stops 
after breakpoint hit, then select another thread or stack frame, the register 
value remain unchanged.
Is this on a single core or a multi core system? Which debugger are you using?
If you run you debugger outside of the CDT does you get the results you expected?
Selection of a stack frame or thread doesn't force the reevaluation of register 
values. 
Fix in the head.

Mikhail, could you verify this, if your tests are satisfactory
we can consider, this last issue fixed(and finally release CDT-3.0)

Thanks.
Fixed.
Verfied.
There is still a minor defect : 

Each time the stackframe is switched, CDT has to query GDB again for the 
register list, which is very slow if GDB has a very long register list. In 
some cases, the register value is not changed at all, and it is not necessay 
for CDT to query GDB.

For example, when a breakpoint hits, the user switches back and forth between 
different stackframe to inspect the register value, in this case, to re-query 
the register state is not necessary.

Can somehow CDT implement a cache mechanism, so that in such cases, CDT does 
not re-query GDB for register value? 
The performance issue is I think a separate issue.  I think it belongs in its 
own PR;  the issue that was filed has been fixed.  Determining update policies 
for the debug views is currently being debated in the DSDP Project's Device 
Debugging sub-project.  I think it's appropriate to approach this separately 
as a post-3.0 task, aligned with DSDP.
Moving to future to keep of 3.0 gating list. Mikhail, please review and adjust
as you see fit.
I agree with Chris. I've submitted a new bug for the performance issue

I fixed the sample code.  The line causing the error was this one:

echo "There was an error processing this request".

The "." at the end assumed a concatination, hence uncommenting the following
echo command caused a boo boo.

    <WithStack>The clear context action fails for a BugzillaTask in a query since it is really
a BugzillaHit that is wrapping a BugzillaTask.
So should we try to make this work?  Are you doing anything in your own 
workspace to work-around this limitation, or just not clearing contexts?  
Admitedly I almost never do it myself unless I'm testing...
The only workaround that exists is to create a bugzilla task with the same bug 
id outside of the query so that it is a regular task.  I do use this on 
occasion, especially when exploring and the context becomes overrun with 
information that is not useful to the task and I want to start fresh.
OK, let's leave it as a limitation for now, since there is a clear work-around 
and it's not clear how much this feature will get used.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When using a subset view in Navigator (for example, by performing a 'go into'
command into a displayed folder), Navigator can become non-functional under the
following condition:
 - The project in which the folder was last time displayed no longer exists.

When this happens, Navigator shows an empty panel, with the name of the subset
in which it was at the last Eclipse exiting; at this point there is no way to
get out of that non-existent subset; Navigator displays the message: "you
attempted to go into a closed project: ProjectName. Please open the project and
try again." (The message is displayed two times and then there is no progress.)

As the project ProjectName no longer exists, there is no easy way out of this
'deadlock' situation. The one work around I found was to re-create a similar
project, with a similar folder structure, go back to Navigator, then succesfully
press the up arrow until the subset mode is fully exited, and then finally
restart Eclipse and delete the dummy project.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Working in RC1, I logged some non-SOAP messages in the TCP/IP monitor. I then
selected a message and chose to validate it. The WS-I SOAP validate dialog
appeared. I chose a location, clicked finish, and nothing happened. 

I haven't yet tested this with a SOAP message but hopefully this problem only
occurs with non-SOAP messages. With non-SOAP messages the WS-I SOAP validate
button should be disabled (this will probably require a new hook in the TCP/IP
monitor that allows you to get the content type) but at least the dialog should
inform you that you cannot validate non-SOAP messages.
Created attachment 43608
patch to org.eclipse.wst.wsi

Non-SOAP messages typically have an empty body.  This was causing the
validator to throw a NPE while generating the log.wsimsg file   The NPE was
going undetected and causing the termination of the validation process.  So
actually, if your monitor were to capture a mixture of SOAP and non-SOAP
messages, you would get the same lack of a result.

I have attached a patch that detects request or response messages with empty
headers or bodies and omits them from the generated log file.  If this causes
no messages to get logged, the validator will pop up an error dialog informing
the user of this and stop the validation process at that point.

This zip file contains a new project (since no test project currently exists for org.eclipse.wst.wsi.ui).  The test class in this project shows how an empty header or body on a request or response will cause a NPE.
ping? Status update?  There's a patch and junit test for this.  Any possibility of getting it addressed?</WithStack>

Walter, interested in fixing this bug? 

This should be relatively easy as javaEE's api's are stable. What's the status on this one?
The status is that this is still an interesting idea, but we don't have people to work on this just now.  We would accept high quality patches, though.
Bug 280115 fixes content assist for pageContext
- Limitation, right now this only appears to work when the EL is in tag attributes, further work is needed to eliminate this limitation.

As far as code assist for the maps, what would be given in the code assist dialog.  As far as I understand it the keys for the map are determined at run time and thus we have no way of determining what keys to code assist with during development. Please correct me if I am mistaken.
Bug 281508 fixes content assist for EL that is not in attributes.  Again this content assist for the implicit objects only works on pageContext because the others are maps and as far as I can tell from what I was reading about EL there is no way to know what will be in these maps before run time so content assist cant suggest anything for them.  If I am wrong in this regard please let me know what you would expect to see for content assist for the maps.
I am thinking that when invoking content assist in this context ${ | } the implicit objects themselves should be suggested.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Currently if you have a jar in your classpath, you can, using the build path ui,
add in native library paths. You should be able to do this for your source code
too so that when launching the project any native required by the code being
developed should be able to access its own dlls.

I tried, for the heck of it, to manually update the .classpath file and add the
appropriate elements for a library to the src classpath entry and it launched
fine and added that to the library path. So it looks like the base code for
using it is already there.

Thanks.

    <WithStack>The Agent Controller does not currently perform the necessary tasks on start 
up.  It does not register signal handlers, and it does not have a way of 
waiting for server threads to complete.

The previous version waited for server threads at the end of its 
initialization, but now that those threads have been moved to transport layers 
it is unclear how the equivalent function can be accomplished.
Kevin,

I know you did some work with this.  Is it finished?
I uncommented the section of AgentController.c that dealt with linux signal 
handlers.
needed to back out this fix... we need to understand how this is effecting 
console.
Is this still an issue?

Yes... this issue is specific to linux. We do not create signal handlers on AC startup.
Retarget to 4.3.

We don't have a specific user-level bug associated with this and it's too risky at this point in the release to mess with the signal handlers.
Retargeting to future as 4.3 is closing down to all non-essential bug fixing.
Transferring ownership of new agemt controller issues with no specific target date to Mikhail for consideration in future releases.

The problem is that preference pages don't know each other. So they can not coordinate who is going to ask for the rebuild.

I implemented a kind of hack to use a preference setting in the default settings to signal that a build has been requested. Works for all subclasses of OptionsConfigurationBlock

If you open a file containing single carriage return characters (\r as opposed to paired \r\n) the comment

    <WithStack>Every GUI item which is disabled should have a tooltip explaining why it is
disabled and what the user has to do in order to enable it. This does not only
apply to the WTP but is especially important there due to the many and widely
dispersed parameters which determine the state of a GUI element.

Eg when doing the first tutorial I get to the point where it says:
" 3. [...] Type the Servlet Name, "XDcoletHelloWorld". Make sure "Generate an
annotated servlet class" is checked. "

The box is disabled. I have no idea why. I double checked all settings and still
have no clue. A simple tooltip saying "no available for XXX" would be extremely
helpful here. This is just one of several examples I have come across while
trying the tutorials.
As there are potentially many places where options are disabled can you please
specify the ones you've come across (that have confused you) so I have a list to
start with. 

After I get a list I'll speak with the component owners to see what can be done.

Thanks.
Unfortunately I didn't write them down until I decided to write the bug report.
It would be better anyway to have a general policy here than to go by what is
particularly confusing to me. This is probably different for other users with
different backgrounds and level of experience. I would propose the following
guidelines regarding this problem:

* Every widget when disabled should display a tooltip stating:
  - why it is disabled.
  - what the user has to do to enable it.
* Widgets can be excepted from this policy if the position and context of the
widget make this obvious; such as indented under another, deselected widget.
* Widgets definitely have to have such a tooltip where the controlling
parameters can not be set from the same widget group or even dialog page.
Janet, this request is to have a tooltip explaining why a disabled element in the GUI is in fact disabled. Is there a consistent way that the platform handles this type of information? Is the consistent way not to have the information available?
I don't think there has ever been a requirement/bug to have tooltips on disabled icons to explain why they are disabled. So there wouldn't be a consistent way to display the information.

However, it's ideal to use the dynamic help that was implemented in Eclipse 3.2M5 to store this type of information.
I'm going to close this bug as won't fix. A lot of infopop (F1) documentaion has been added since this bug was opened.

Please open new bugs for specific cases where you find documentation lacking.

I still think that any disabled GUI element should have a tooltip explaining its state (and how to change it), but this is probably not the right place for this discussion.
Feel free to bring up the conversation on the wtp-dev@eclipse.org list or on one of our weekly open status calls [1].

    <WithStack>Scenario:

-Create a new Dynamic Web Project (not a flex project)
-Add some simple content
-Assign the project to the WLS 9.0 generic server runtime
-With autobuild turned off and without explicitly executing a build on the
project, execute RoS for an html file under WebContent

Result: the generic server Ant publish task fails because the .deployables dir
has not been created.

Expected: Although I have auto-build turned off, I do have the "Build (if
required) before launching" pref enabled, so I would expect this project to be
automatically built before the publish attempt is made.
note: using the 7/19 I-build 
Dropping severity and reassigning; I had been expecting that the "build (if
required) before launching" would also apply to server launch config delegates
(i.e. LaunchConfiguration.launch() would be calling
ILaunchConfigurationDelegate2.buildForLaunch()), however, that doesn't appear to
be happening due to the fact that Server is calling the
ILaunchConfiguration.launch(String, IProgressMonitor) with the result that the
build flag defaults to true; Tim: should the server framework be respecting the
build before launch pref?). The issue of whether the server framework should
also be handling builds automatically on module launch is a completely separate
item (this would be a nice service to provide and could either be exposed via
another server pref like "build (if required) before running modules" or the
value of the existing build before launching pref could be assumed to hold for
both cases).
Hi Rob,

I agree that we should be honoring the 'build before launch' preference, and I'd
lean towards reusing the existing run/debug preference instead of creating
another preference. The reason we're calling the launch(String,
IProgressMonitor) instead of the other method is simply that this code was
written pre-3.0 when the other methods didn't exist.

Although I agree we need to do this, is it really critical for 0.7? The build
preference is on by default and we've had this behaviour the entire time. It's
not too unreasonable to tell users that they have to build before RoS. I think
we can move this one to P4 and fix in M8.
hey Tim: I agree that this can be pushed out.
Will target to fix in M8.
I've fixed the problem by triggering a build on every server start, although
this probably is no longer necessary due to the removal of the .deployables
directory. I did not add a preference for this yet (it is always on) and we'll

if another preference should be added.

Changes dropped to HEAD, and I'll tag for this week's I-build.
Were we not able to use the 'build before launch' preference?
The debug 'Build before launch' preference is only in the UI layer and does not
work if people call the debug API directly. In this case we're in a core
(non-UI) plugin, so it doesn't make sense to try to reuse that preference.
Just tested this with RC4 and, for a generic WLS 9.0 server, the project was not built on server start or ROS (I had auto-build turned off): obviously, the underlying server code has changed substantially since this fix was first put in and the removal of .deployables removes much of the motivation behind the original issue.

Tim: should I still be expecting to see a build triggered on server startup?
Closing.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Scenario:

-Create a new Dynamic Web Project (not a flex project)
-Add some simple content
-Assign the project to the WLS 9.0 generic server runtime
-With autobuild turned off and without explicitly executing a build on the
project, execute RoS for an html file under WebContent

Result: the generic server Ant publish task fails because the .deployables dir
has not been created.

Expected: Although I have auto-build turned off, I do have the "Build (if
required) before launching" pref enabled, so I would expect this project to be
automatically built before the publish attempt is made.
note: using the 7/19 I-build 
Dropping severity and reassigning; I had been expecting that the "build (if
required) before launching" would also apply to server launch config delegates
(i.e. LaunchConfiguration.launch() would be calling
ILaunchConfigurationDelegate2.buildForLaunch()), however, that doesn't appear to
be happening due to the fact that Server is calling the
ILaunchConfiguration.launch(String, IProgressMonitor) with the result that the
build flag defaults to true; Tim: should the server framework be respecting the
build before launch pref?). The issue of whether the server framework should
also be handling builds automatically on module launch is a completely separate
item (this would be a nice service to provide and could either be exposed via
another server pref like "build (if required) before running modules" or the
value of the existing build before launching pref could be assumed to hold for
both cases).
Hi Rob,

I agree that we should be honoring the 'build before launch' preference, and I'd
lean towards reusing the existing run/debug preference instead of creating
another preference. The reason we're calling the launch(String,
IProgressMonitor) instead of the other method is simply that this code was
written pre-3.0 when the other methods didn't exist.

Although I agree we need to do this, is it really critical for 0.7? The build
preference is on by default and we've had this behaviour the entire time. It's
not too unreasonable to tell users that they have to build before RoS. I think
we can move this one to P4 and fix in M8.
hey Tim: I agree that this can be pushed out.
Will target to fix in M8.
I've fixed the problem by triggering a build on every server start, although
this probably is no longer necessary due to the removal of the .deployables
directory. I did not add a preference for this yet (it is always on) and we'll
see the reaction to this in the builds before deciding if this is necessary or
if another preference should be added.

    <WithStack>VE is not handling correctly components that inherit from the standard SWT one.

To reproduce the issue:
1/ Create a new MyTable component, extending the Table one (override 
checkSubclss() method)
2/ Create a new MyTableColumn component, inheriting from TableColumn
3/ Drag &amp; drop MyTable into a composite
4/ Drag &amp; drop MyTableColumn on the table

=&gt; The code is not generated correctly, as it assumes that SWT controls cannot 
be derived.

Joe Winchester is aware of this issue but I don't have his ID to assign the 
bug to him :-)
Joe, are we really going to handle this?  This is officially unsupported by the
SWT folks so I'm not sure we should support it either...

What is the use case for this?
Dave - I agree that this isn't officially support and to subclass anything 
other than Composite or Canvas requires the user to override the checkSubclass
() method and is basically a hack.  What we need to do is focus on having a 
good framework for a controller/wrapper/delegate such as JFace and publishing 
the tutorial/docs on this and then folks who want to effectively add behavior 
to an SWT widget can do so with strategy containment (which JFace viewers are 
an example of).  Once 3.1 is cooked (which is today and I was up till 3am 
fixing last minute bugs) doing JFace is probably the highest line item and I 
hope to work on it next week.  I will take a look at what it takes to allow 
TableColumn subclasses to be allowed because it might be a very simple fix in 
which case I'll report back what the change would be and what its impact is 
and then we can decide whether to check in a patch or not - JRW</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I don't think I was seeing this prior to switching "startBeforePublish" to true

to be triggered when modifications had been made since the last publish).

Could setting startBeforePublish to true cause this behavior?

fyi: I'm using the 7/19 I-build (plus the most recent from HEAD for the various
generic server plugins)
Hi Rob,

This didn't change as a result of switching to startBeforePublish. It has always
done a publish before Run on Server, just to make sure that things are in sync.

Publish is meant to be like building the workspace. When in doubt, a 'client'
should always publish. The server adapters should have enough information (it
has information on whether the module is new/changed/not changed/removed, and
for each module it can also get the list of resources or the delta since the
last publish) and be smart enough to not (or incrementally) publish when possible.

I think the 'when in doubt, publish' paradigm is correct, and although we could
make the publish on Run on Server optional like the 'publish when starting'
option, that's not really the problem here since it should be incremental even
when the user clicks Publish in the Servers view. I'm guessing that either a
particular server (or maybe the generic framework) is always triggering a full
publish, even if nothing has changed.

Given the above, I'm going to return this bug as invalid. Please feel free to
reopen if you have issues with my comments, and otherwise open a new bug or
reopen this one against a particular server that is not supporting incremental
publishing, or is publishing when there are no changes.
hey Tim, thanks again for the detailed explanation; I must have only started
noticing once the publish got pushed after the startup; yeah, the issue I'm
having is with the a generic server that's using the AntPublisher - I'll talk to
Gorkem and see if it makes more sense to try and add something into the generic
server framework level or just augment the Ant publish script to do minimal work
if things haven't changed.

    <WithStack>This bug is file against RC1.

WebResource.getPath() works for a Web Project, if the source folder is
WebContent, which is used the standard WTP Web App project wizard.

For custom file layout, the method return an incorrect path. An extra "\&lt;Folder
Name&gt; is appended.

For example, the source folder is "web", and the jsp is "foo.jsp". The path
returned is "\web\foo.jsp", instead of just "foo.jsp".

The problem doesn't occur with Servlet.
Fix released 7.20 should make it to this evenings build.
Verified fixed in RC5.

1/ Create a Web Project using default setting.
2/ Rename WebContent to Web
3/ update .wtpmodules

    <WithStack>Kihup,
we need JUnit coverage for this problem we encountered.  See bugzilla 104120.
We should also test other missing attributes.
Keith,
As discussed.
I am re-assigning this defect to you.
Thanks.
Perhaps Gabriel can assist with this Valentin.
Should we target this for 1.5.1 or 2.0?

Just adding a proper link to the original bug for which we need a JUnit test https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104120.

Created attachment 44560
Junit test for the missing name attribute
Created attachment 44592
New (more complete) updated Junit test
Created attachment 44655
Final Junit testing patch

    <WithOutStack>Kihup,
we need JUnit coverage for this problem we encountered.  See bugzilla 104120.
We should also test other missing attributes.
Keith,
As discussed.
I am re-assigning this defect to you.
Thanks.
Perhaps Gabriel can assist with this Valentin.
Should we target this for 1.5.1 or 2.0?

Just adding a proper link to the original bug for which we need a JUnit test https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104120.

Created attachment 44560
Junit test for the missing name attribute
Created attachment 44592
New (more complete) updated Junit test
Created attachment 44655

    <WithStack>In tracking down odd validator messages, I stumbled across this method:

 protected void addValidationMessage(XMLValidationInfo valinfo, IOException
exception)
  { 
    String messageStr = exception.getMessage();
	Throwable cause = exception.getCause();
	while(messageStr == null &amp;&amp; cause != null){
		cause = exception.getCause();
		if(cause != null){
			messageStr = cause.getMessage();
		}
	}
  .
  .
  .

If the original IOException has a "cause" but that cause has no message, an
infinite loop will occur because the "cause" local variable can never become
null within the while loop.

The handling of the exception and cause objects further down is also causing
strange validation messages.  For instance, an inability to download the a
system referenced DTD such as
http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-jsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd results in a validation
marker with just "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-jsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd" as
the error's message.
In light of "out of the box" experience for disconnected users, see Bug 104413, 
we might want to consider fixing this for RC2 if simple and safe.

    <WithStack>The remote resources cache starts a Job when the cache plugin is loaded. 
Currently the Job keeps running by rescheduling itself to run once per hour.

This isn't necessary, is it?  The Job can be scheduled for the first time when a
lookup is required and should be allowed to be unscheduled when it's not being
used any more.  Am I not missing the reasoning behind the rescheduling?
Nitin, you're right. This is something I just hadn't got around to fixing. I'll
fix this post 0.7 so the job is only scheduled if there are resources that could
not be cached.
I've modified the cache to only schedule a job when there are resources to cache. There will only be resources to cache when the resources were previously requested and the cache was unable to cache them for some reason (such as no internet connectivity).

This fix has been released on 20060412 for WTP 1.5M6.
Verified in WTP 1.5 RC5a

Hi - Are you adding a Job rule with the specific projects?   Looks like jdt is
using the workspace root, so this rule may need to include that.
Chuck, I am not sure why you assigned this to me. Did you mean to assign it to 
Nitin?
Looking at the stack again... do we want to open this against jdt?

The platform is in the middle of a close resource action, and the container is
just calling: JavaCore.getClasspathContainer() - which gets the rule conflict.

Not sure why this should be illegal.

I'll move to jdt.

Moving to Platform/Resources.
Closing a project uses a project-level scheduling rule. The call to
JavaCore.getClasspathContainer() can actually modify resources, and in order to
do that it uses the workspace root as the scheduling rule (and it has to). One
cannot try to begin a rule that is more comprehensive than the current rule.
Thus, calling that method from a resource change listener is not safe. Also,
doing so from a PRE_CLOSE resource change listener is not valid either.
A similar issue in PDE: bug 94435.
Looks like the jdt team will consider a fix in 3.2....

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 94764 ***
Bug 94764 is in Platform/Resources, not JDT, and is only about improving error
reporting, so this problem will still occur even if that bug is fixed.

It is wrong to call JavaCore.getClasspathContainer() from a PRE_CLOSE resource
change listener, because it may create resources, and you are not allowed to do
so from this type of resource change listener.
Ok Kostantin, looks like this is back to you again...

JavaCore.getClasspathContainer() can't be called on the PRE_CLOSE event, so maybe
listen for this in your FlexibleProjectContainer$Listener class?
Thanks for doing the legwork to investigate this. I committed the fix. Haven't released it as there are other changes in the plugin. This may or may not be in RC1.

    <WithStack>Description:
Image can't display if name includes Chinese

steps to reproduce:
1.Add a image 
2.Switch to Properties, choose source to "file"
3.Set a valid URL, such as "file:///D:/shu/image/logoÍ¼±ê.jpg" and click OK
4.Click "..." button again to show the expression builder and click OK
5.Preview

Expected result:
No error

Actual result:
Chinese character can't display correctly. It shows 
like "file:///D:/shu/image/logo??.jpg". and error throws out when preview
Chinese character can work under Chinese system.
I don't think we anticipate Chinese characters works all right under English 
system
Verified in Build Eclipse3.1 20050721.
This bug is because of locale.</WithStack>

It might be worth thinking about whether o.e.text needs a UI agnostic *editing

services currently managed by the viewer but really not depending on the

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a parameter named "&amp;lt;".
2. Preview. 
3. Parameter dialog pops up.

Actual result: "lt;" appears instead of "&amp;lt;".
parameter dialog uses "IScalarParameterDefn" to get parameter name. If you set
the name to &amp;lt;, the getName() method returns a "&lt;". Is it expected?
I have checked it, Engine never returns "&lt;" if name set to "&amp;lt;".
we can reproduce this bug on Designer. 
if we name parameter as "&amp;lt;", the design file should be written as &lt;scalar-
parameter name="&amp;amp;lt;"&gt;. we should not write design file directly as 
&lt;scalar-parameter name="&amp;lt;"&gt; to reproduce this bug.
This bug exists in paramter dialog, while not exist in parameter pane, so the 
value returns from engine is correct.

    <WithStack>1)Allow the separation of the testcase name and the test method.
	This feature allows the user to call the same test method with 
different test names and avoids unnecessary code being written.A good example 
for this is a situation where one might have to run the same test on different 
versions of the same product.Using this framework he would use the same test 
method with different test names thus completing the tests.

The user can use the getTestMethodName() and setTestMethodName(String) to get 
and set the test method. By default the test case name is the name of the test 
method.

2)Allow test methods to have parameters.
	In general if you are using the above feature you would expect to be 
allowed to pass parameters to your test method. This is not allowed in regular 
junit and has been added as a feature in DynamicTestCase. You will have the 
flexibility to pass any number of parameters to your test method.

The user can use the getParameter() and setParameter(Object[]) to get and set 
the parameters to your test method.

These two features add a lot of flexibility to the junit framework and will 
avoid duplication of reusable code.

There has to be UI support to allow the user to specify the test case name and 
test method to be called and link datapools for parameters.

I will also attach the code for doing the described operations that can be 
used.
Created attachment 25031
Code and samples that show how things work....

You can use DynamicTestCase.java and IDynamicTest.java directly ... there are
also some samples that can be used ...

If you think that this is a feature that can be included then you will have to
come up with ways to specify the test methods and their parameters in the
.testsuite files. :-)
Maybe i should have opened separate features for the different items ... but 
couldnt figure out how to go about doin that ... if you need anything feel 
free to contact me :-)

    <WithStack>Hello, when creating JavaScript inside a JSP HTML page, Java variables definied 
in a for loop are not recognized in an embedded Java expression.

I'll attach a small example to this bug report that spits the error message "i 
cannot be resolved" although the page itsself renders fine. In the OpenMDX code, 
there are about 45 places that thrigger this wrong error message.

The interesting thing is that this is only triggered in the first occurence 
(inside the &lt;script&gt;-Tags, and not for the second one (that is in the body).
Created attachment 25032
Test jsp file that triggers the error message
Thanks the the sample file ... we need as many test cases as we can get. 
We'll look at problem and fix for 1.0 release. 


Thanks. Can you reproduce it?
Glad you asked ... no, I can not reproduce it. I tried on latest build (I 7/22)
if you can reproduce it on latests builds, please re-open ... perhas with any
other info that might help us to reproduce. (configuration file, or log file?
... available from Help About box). 

Hello,

Maybe it is of importance that I open the file inside a "simple" java project, 
not inside a J2EE project. I just installed the WST via Help/Software Updates/
Find and Install into a rather unconfigured eclipse 3.1, and the i is marked 
with a red curly line.

I'll attach the zipped project directory, as well as my config files to this bug 
report.

The used versions (as shown from the Product Configuration page) are listed in 
the config.details I'll also attach.

This is the zipped minimal project directory that shows the bug.
Mass transfer from pa to dw. Needs more triage. 

This is not reproducible in 3.2

with a red curly line.

I'll attach the zipped project directory, as well as my config files to this bug 
report.

The used versions (as shown from the Product Configuration page) are listed in 
the config.details I'll also attach.

This is the zipped minimal project directory that shows the bug.
Mass transfer from pa to dw. Needs more triage. 

This is not reproducible in 3.2
Per Ian's analysis, unreproducible in WTP 3.2.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>I have reproduced this bug on text editor and java editor.

Scenario:
- create a new file with 3 lines of text inside and save
- Delete the 2 last lines
- Save
- Undo Typing (the 2 deleted lines come back and the file can be saved)
- Delete the last line: here it is the bug =&gt; The file cannot be saved anymore !!

For the scenario purpose, I start with a new file, but it works with an existing
file.

This bug has been also reproduced on Eclipse3.1RC4 on Linux Debian as OS.
Works for me using R3.1. Maybe I did some steps wrong, e.g. "Delete the last 2
lines" can be accomplished in many different ways ;-).

Please provide more detailed steps if you see this using R3.1 or newer.
To delete a bunch of lines, I select them, and use the delete key. The 2 lines
must be deleted at once.

If I use the "delete line" key, I am not reproducing the bug (the 2 lines are
deleted independantly).

I produced also it on eclipse 3.1RC3 on windows XP (so, seems not to be linked
to OS).
3.1RC3 is a release candidate and not R3.1. Did you see it on R3.1?

Can you provide selection and caret for each step, e.g. do you have

111
222
333&lt;caret&gt;&lt;eof&gt;

or
111
222
333
&lt;caret&gt;&lt;eof&gt;
I produced the bug on eclipse 3.1 (final release) on linux debian.
I also produced the bug on eclipse 3.1RC3 on windows XP.

It works with both your scenarii:
This is the step I followed with the 1st scnenario

&lt;caret&gt;333&lt;eof&gt;

with &lt;caret&gt; to &lt;eof&gt; selected 
=&gt; hit the "delete" key

Bug: the file cannot be saved now


Hope you have enough data :)

The editor thinks the file is not dirty (no * in the tab). Looks like a
modification stamp bug.
Cannot reproduce with I20051222.

I believe this could be bug 109104 which is in 3.1 has been fixed in 3.1.1 and 3.2 M2.

    <WithStack>It seems like when the Java compiler is called from within an Ant build file (as
generated by the PDE), then the compiler does not respect the compiler problem
severity levels configured in the preferences or at the project level.

So if I for instance in the preferences "Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Errors/Warnings" set
the level of "Potential programming problems &gt; Serializable class without
serialVersionUID" to "Ignore" then I still get a warning when I compile the
plugin project using the PDE generated Ant build.xml.
This is a problem with the build script.
Moving to PDE/Build
PDE build is not workspace aware meaning that it will ignore all the project
settings such as encoding, warning level, jre level, etc.
pde.build will use the property javacWarnings.&lt;libraryName&gt; from the plugin's build.properties file.

This property should be a list of the kinds of warnings we want the compiler to report.  ex:
 javacWarnings..= semicolon, syntheticAccess, nls

These are passed directly to the compiler using the commandline argument -warn
Currently they are passed as "-warn:&lt;warnings&gt;" rather than "-warn:+&lt;warnings&gt;" which means the default warnings will still need to be listed.

We would need the pde.ui to write this information to the build.properties file
re comment 3:
these javacWarning.* keys are too advanced and require a complicated UI, which may not after all be better than the source page.
They do not warrant adding them to the Build page of the editor.

The user can always use the source page.

Proper pde/build documentation of this key should be enough
Bug 123597 covers the documentation of these properties

    <WithStack>3.1, dual-processor machine

I tried to start eclipse with an existing workspace, but it wouldn't show the
workbench window after having shown the startup progress dialog. The CPU is at
100%, which indicates that both processors are under heavy load.

Stacktraces look like the one below.

I'm not sure whether JDT/Core is the right component for this bug. But I assume
that classpath containers should not be initialized concurrently.

Classpath containers are allowed to be initialized concurrently. The
infrastructure is handling these (in theory).

Since both offending threads are pointed at PDE container init, will move PR there. 

Wassim - could it loop indefinitely ?
After killing the vm and restarting, it hung again with the same stacktrace.
After killing again and restarting again, I was not able to reproduce any more
(I did several shutdown/restart cycles, which all went well).
I made a change to how access to the HashMaps is synchronized.  Reopen, if you 
can still reproduce in the coming builds.
I noticed a fix was already reported in bug 103410 and fix applied to head and 
3.1.1 streams.  I will mark this as duplicate.
Marking as duplicate, but merging the additional fix into 3.1.1 stream, 
because the hash maps are static, so the synchronization should be on the 
class.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 103410 ***
*** Bug 112663 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 112920 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>3.1, dual-processor machine

I tried to start eclipse with an existing workspace, but it wouldn't show the
workbench window after having shown the startup progress dialog. The CPU is at
100%, which indicates that both processors are under heavy load.

Stacktraces look like the one below.

I'm not sure whether JDT/Core is the right component for this bug. But I assume
that classpath containers should not be initialized concurrently.

Classpath containers are allowed to be initialized concurrently. The
infrastructure is handling these (in theory).

Since both offending threads are pointed at PDE container init, will move PR there. 

Wassim - could it loop indefinitely ?
After killing the vm and restarting, it hung again with the same stacktrace.
After killing again and restarting again, I was not able to reproduce any more
(I did several shutdown/restart cycles, which all went well).
I made a change to how access to the HashMaps is synchronized.  Reopen, if you 
can still reproduce in the coming builds.
I noticed a fix was already reported in bug 103410 and fix applied to head and 
3.1.1 streams.  I will mark this as duplicate.
Marking as duplicate, but merging the additional fix into 3.1.1 stream, 
because the hash maps are static, so the synchronization should be on the 
class.

User can add a driver from "Manage JDBC Driver",then the Dataset will become 
valid,do not need to switch to "Data Source" Page any more.
It works in 20050817's build.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Currently, the detail formatter preferences page allows detail formatters to be

1) Label: DetailFormatter, or Eclipse default if no DetailFormatter

   DetailPane: DetailFormatter, or toString if no DetailFormatter

effectively, and in fact I had to try the middle option to see what it actually

However, despite these options, there is no way to do what I want:
4) Label: DetailFormatter, or EclipseDefault if no DetailFormatter
   DetailPane: toString


Instead of just adding a fourth option to the dialog, I propose that the single
set of radio buttons at the bottom is broken up into two sets:
a) What to display against the label
- EclipseDefault
- toString
- DetailFormatter, or toString if no DetailFormatter
- DetailFormatter, or EclipseDefault if no DetailFormatter

b) What to display in the detail pane
- toString
- DetailFormatter, or toString if no DetailFormatter

Note, that this may affect interaction with Structure formatters and create even
more combinations, I haven't thought about that.

The warning message on the Java Compiler project properties page should link to
Java Build Path as well. I suggest to replace the "Configure..." link by two
links "Configure Installed JREs" and "Configure Build Path...".

The "Configure Build Path..." should just go to the Java Build Path page iff the
page is a properties page. If it is in the main preferences, it should show the
dialog to select a project for project-specific options.
The second suggestion is probably not very useful. You don't want to go to all
of the projects through the project list dialog.

Patch 1: "Creating a datapool" topic

I intend to submit this patch in four parts:

(1) "Creating a datapool" topic. This topic includes/included many outdated
components as described below.
(2) "Tutorial: Creating a datapool driven JUnit test application". A tutorial
prepared as a replacement for the "Accessing a datapool from a Hyades test"
topic. (I am just waiting to confirm a software defect before submitting this
tutorial.)
(4) Images related to parts 1 and 2.
(3) General review of other datapool sections, including "Datapool structure",
"Opening a datapool", and "Editing a datapool". Also, updating related
references to include the new tutorial.

=================================================
104481 Patch Part 1: "Creating a datapool" topic
=================================================
- A number of UI names were not accurate. For example, in the process of
opening the New Datapool wizard the "New &gt; Test Artifact" option is now "New &gt;
Test Element". Also, now "Datapool" is listed in the "Test Assets" folder
rather than "Test Elements".
- The procedure claimed you can access the New Test Artifact dialog from the
file menu. This is no longer the case for the Test Element dialog. (Note: you
can however, access the New Datapool wizard directly using the file menu).
- The proecedure claimed that the Datapool overview pane appears after you
first create the datapool. In the current UI, the first datapool equivalence
class appears. I updated the related graphic.
- I added a new graphic for the overview pane  (I intend to attach it
separately, with all other images related to this defect).
- Added information about the CSV file structure, including equivalence class
information. The new example illustrates a CSV file with two equivalence
classes. (Note however, the import does not succeed with two equivalence
classes &gt; defect 111444.)
- The documentation claimed that the UI qualified row indeces using equivalence
class names (for example equivalenceClass1::0). With the new tabbed view, this
is no longer the case.
- The documentation claimed that if equivalence class names are NOT specified
in the CSV file, each row will be imported as belonging to a separate
equivalence class. This is no longer the case. All imported rows are grouped
under a single equivalence class.

Patch 2: "Tutorial: Creating a datapool driven JUnit test application"

========================================================================
104481 Patch Part 2: "Tutorial - Creating a datapool driven JUnit test
application".
========================================================================

 Note: currently the tutorial does not work due to an assumed sofware defect
(see 111622). If the software defect is confirmed and fixed, then this tutorial
is complete as is (except for the final non-essential screen shot). If it turns
out that there is a missing element or error in the tutorial, then this patch
will be marked as obsolete and an additional patch submitted. Thus, it would be
nice if bug 111622 can be resolved/rejected as soon as possible.

============================================================================

I developed a complete tutorial to replace the "Accessing a datapool from a
Hyades test" section.

Here is why replacing the section with a tutorial is a good idea:

- A portion of the material is outdated as reported in the original posting.
- The section does not show the user how to set up the JUnit tests in the first
place.	It only shows the user how to substitute values from a datapool into an
existing non-test application. A comment says "// Lines from test ommitted...",
but, from the context, it isn't really obvious what the test would look like.
- The application itself is too complicated. When we are trying to show our
TPTP test features, it is nice to work from a simple and generic application
(i.e. so the user focuses primarily on our technology).
- The example is based on someone who went to "www.amazon.com and searched for
a book named 'atonement'." ... In any case, the title "atonement" is probably
not suitable. (I hope the localizers don't try to translate it).
- The java.io import was missing for the File class.
- The following library import statement was missing:
d:\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.1.0.jar
- Other datapool libary paths were out of date (as noted in the initial
posting).
- An overview tutorial seems to be the right way to start off the test
documentation.

General tutorial notes:
- The tutorial shows you how to set up a simple "shopping cart" application,
create standard TPTP JUnit tests (using hard coded data values), and then
integrate a datapool using the datapool API. 
- I updated the library names and paths in the tutorial (along with detailed
instructions to add them to the java build path using Eclipse).
- Note: an enhancement request (111517) has been issued for the wizard to add
these libraries automatically.
- I added "Related tasks" and "Related concepts" links.
- Stay tuned for images related to this tutorial.

=========================================================

"Datapool structure" concepts/cdatapools.htm
---------------------------------------------
&gt; Clarified the purpose of using a datapool.
&gt; I removed the statement "For the purposes of performance testing, you can
think of an equivalence class as just a named row index, displayed in the
leftmost datapool column (row::0, row::1, row::2, for example)." First of all,
it is not really useful to think of an equivalence class as a named row column
(infact, it is confusing). Secondly, the UI has a new tabed view and the row::1
syntax does not appear.
&gt; I removed the statement "Equivalence classes are important for low-level
tests that software developers use to test their source code. " because I think
equivalence classes are more generally applicable (e.g. Equivalence classes can
group related data for organizational purposes). Please let me know if you
disagree.
&gt; Added an overview description to the first paragraph.
&gt; Added &lt;h3&gt;Performance testing example&lt;/h3&gt; to start the performance testing
example paragraph.
&gt; Added a Related tasks link to the tutorial (patch 2).

"Editing a datapool" /tasks/teditdp.htm
-----------------------------------------
&gt; The new screen shot in 101306 is also included in this feature.
&gt; I removed the paragraph starting with "Before you can add data to a datapool,
it must contain at least one equivalence class"... In the current UI, the
equivalence class is added automatically.
&gt; The "add record" and "add equivalence" class dialogs no longer exist in the
current UI.
Ruth - following images have to be deleted: ../images/eqdlg.gif
../images/rowdlg.gif
&gt; I moved the Overview tab diagram and description to the "Editing a datapool
section". I originally added this to "Creating a datapool" in patch 1. However,
this section seems a more appropriate place and we probably shouldn't
have it in both places.
&gt; Added a Related tasks link to the tutorial (patch 2).

"Opening a datapool" /tasks/topendp.htm
-----------------------------------------
&gt; This section claimed that the Overview tab appears when you double-click a
datapool. In fact, the datapools first equivalence class appears.
&gt; Added a Related tasks link to the tutorial (patch 2).

"Creating a datapool" tasks\tcreatedp.htm

Adds note to run Agent Controller and a few doc tweaks/fixes

- Added a note to run the Agent Controller in the prerequisites section.
- Changed the procedure to run the tests as a TPTP test rather than a standard
JUnit test.
- Fully qualified the File class as java.io.File.
Abdullah, I believe that the patch that you submitted for 111622 was built on
top of this patch, and so I applied the patch for 111622 and didn't apply this
one. I think that this bugzilla was fixed at the same time as 111622 and so am

Yes, that's correct. The file submitted in the 111622 includes all the updates.

void func()
{
  boolean bool = open();
}

In Eclipse 3.1 I get a warning for that : "bool is never read". The 
corresponding "Quick Fix" completely removes the line :-/
Very bad. It would be better if just the assignment to the variable bool would 
be deleted ...

void func()
{
  open();
}

Cheers - Marcel.
Moving to JDT/UI
Technically, the behavior is correct, since the initializer belongs to the
declaration, and the quick fix is called "Remove declaration of 'bool' and
assignments without possible side effects".

However, I agree that the initializer should not be removed unless it's a
constant expression. For complex initializers such as ...
  boolean bool = open() &amp;&amp; open();
..., this may however introduce syntax errors.

Hmm - syntax error ?

the quick fix says "remove declaration of ... and assignments without possible 
side effects" 

in my example above

boolean bool = open();

the quick fix not only removes the assignment, it does ALSO remove the method 
invocation !

Agree ?

    <WithStack>Using Tomcat 5.5.9 on the 7/19 i-build; the server was running and I executed a
"debug on server" command for a JSP that belonged to a dynamic web project
already deployed to the server; as expected, it offered to restart in debugging
mode but the shutdown hung.
Hi Rob,

I couldn't reproduce with 5.5.9 or another version I tried. Can you reproduce
every time, or is there something I might be missing?
Just tried again and I was able to repro; some other odd things I'm seeing: 
-even when I stop the server I get a dialog asking me if I'd like "start in
debug mode" due to the breakpoints in the workspace
-when I execute a debug on server, I get both a "must restart in debugging mode"
dialog following by the dialog that asks if I want to start in debug mode due to
the breakpoints
-when I killed my test eclipse I was left with a dialog indicating that it was
waiting for the publish step to complete (no cancel or close on that dialog)

Need to redo this with tracing on for Tomcat..

OK, tracing didn't really clear anything up but it is successfully stopping and
starting before it hangs (I'm assuming this is a deadlock involving the various
IServerListeners and other threads that are created during server start - I'm
going to have to debug the execution to figure out what's going on); externally
stopping the Tomcat server broke the deadlock and allowed the debugging session
to launch (although it failed since the server was terminated).

Probably won't be much help, but here's the tracing output (I've noted with a
***hang*** where it hung; that stack trace is one I included in an existing
Trace call so ignore)

I am also having trouble reproducing this.  I'm curious if there is anything in 
the dynamic web project beyond some simple "test" JSPs?

Tomcat has the "feature" of hanging during shutdown if a webapp doesn't fully 
clean itselft up.  However, it takes a bit of effort to create a webapp that 
exhibits this behavior.
Given the age and number of code changes since the bug was reported, I'm going to assume that this issue is no longer a problem.  Though the hang actually occurred, I'm marking it as WORKSFORME to avoid implying that any changes were made to address this particular issue. If the issue resurfaces, a new bug report with new details would probably be appropriate.
This is part of a mass update to close out all stale WTP bugs which are in the resolved state without an appropriate targeted version.  If you feel this bug was closed inappropriately, please reopen.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Using Tomcat 5.5.9 on the 7/19 i-build; the server was running and I executed a
"debug on server" command for a JSP that belonged to a dynamic web project
already deployed to the server; as expected, it offered to restart in debugging
mode but the shutdown hung.
Hi Rob,

I couldn't reproduce with 5.5.9 or another version I tried. Can you reproduce
every time, or is there something I might be missing?
Just tried again and I was able to repro; some other odd things I'm seeing: 
-even when I stop the server I get a dialog asking me if I'd like "start in
debug mode" due to the breakpoints in the workspace
-when I execute a debug on server, I get both a "must restart in debugging mode"
dialog following by the dialog that asks if I want to start in debug mode due to
the breakpoints
-when I killed my test eclipse I was left with a dialog indicating that it was
waiting for the publish step to complete (no cancel or close on that dialog)

Need to redo this with tracing on for Tomcat..

OK, tracing didn't really clear anything up but it is successfully stopping and
starting before it hangs (I'm assuming this is a deadlock involving the various
IServerListeners and other threads that are created during server start - I'm
going to have to debug the execution to figure out what's going on); externally
stopping the Tomcat server broke the deadlock and allowed the debugging session
to launch (although it failed since the server was terminated).

Probably won't be much help, but here's the tracing output (I've noted with a
***hang*** where it hung; that stack trace is one I included in an existing
Trace call so ignore)

I am also having trouble reproducing this.  I'm curious if there is anything in 
the dynamic web project beyond some simple "test" JSPs?

Tomcat has the "feature" of hanging during shutdown if a webapp doesn't fully 
clean itselft up.  However, it takes a bit of effort to create a webapp that 
exhibits this behavior.
Given the age and number of code changes since the bug was reported, I'm going to assume that this issue is no longer a problem.  Though the hang actually occurred, I'm marking it as WORKSFORME to avoid implying that any changes were made to address this particular issue. If the issue resurfaces, a new bug report with new details would probably be appropriate.
This is part of a mass update to close out all stale WTP bugs which are in the resolved state without an appropriate targeted version.  If you feel this bug was closed inappropriately, please reopen.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>While associating context with tasks is useful, Mylar core has support for 
working with composite contexts (e.g. when multiple tasks are active).  In 
order to support interaction modes that don't require on diligently 
activating/deactivating tasks, we should expose a better UI for working with 
these composite contexts.  For example, all of the task contexts in a category 
could form a composite context that's always available via Open Type and 
content assist.  These composite contexts will probably have a more coarse 
granularity, and be more closely releated to working sets.
Done as part of context API clean up.  Changes listed in porting guide.  Global contexts are now supported ensuring that we can add facilities like those suggested in the description post 2.0.  However, we do not currently have a driver for such a facility.  Open Type already reverts to the workspace history open type so it works well enough when no task is active.

*** Bug 106828 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
reconcile(...) works during typing but when the file is opened the JME is
thrown. This is the same behavior as in 3.0 but in 3.1 we made the editor's
reconciler more stable so that it does not crash but logs the exception.

Since the reconciler works during typing I suggest to handle save and open as well.
Problem happened when the working copy was consistent and force problem
detection was on.

Changed ReconcileWorkingCopyOperation to not compute problems if the project
doesn't have the Java nature in this case.

    <WithStack>Today, user has to run the adapter before getting validation done.

There are two types of validation done by GLA runtime:  

1) It does schema validation on the GLA adapter file itself against the GLA
adapter schema files.  This is done when configuring the adapter in the runtime.
 When in the GLA editor this validation is done when the adapter file is saved
and also when it is run.  In both cases errors found are shown in the Problems
view.  Note, this schema validation is only done when eclipse is running with an
IBM JDK.  The Sun JDK does support XML schema validation.   I don't know what
the Sun XML validator is that Lennart mentioned.

2) In the GLA formatter component when it creates the CBE, it checks for all of
the mandatory CBE fields before returning the CBE.  If the CBE is missing
mandatory fields, an error message is logged and the CBE is not returned.  When
in the GLA editor the GLA formatter is only executed when the adapter file is
run and any missing CBE field errors found are displayed in the Problems view.

The GLA runtime cannot perform any validation on the CBE's it generates until it
tries to generate them during execution of the adapter.  The GLA only knows
about CBE's in the formatter and outputter components.  Checking for the
presence of rules for the mandatory CBE fields when the adapter is saved would
have to be done by the GLA editor UI.  It sounds like Lennart wants that kind of
CBE validation.
Please raise the priority to P2
Update component
Candidate for 4.2
Adding myself to cc list so I will get notified when "Design Summary" section of the design document is completed.
My comments in upper case:

In the GLA formatter component when it creates the CBE, it checks for all of the mandatory CBE fields before returning the CBE. If the CBE is missing mandatory fields, an error message is logged IN HGLA.LOG
Here's the user comment:

Q: 3A1 (2) Could this be improved by TPTP bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104487?
A: Yes.  CBE validation would improve this to a 3.  If the GLA would then tell the user what to update, this could potentially score higher. (i.e., don't just say "CBE Validation failed" but bring the user to the exact field that failed, provide a recommendation on how to correct the error, and allow the user to correct.)

Here's the definition for 3A1:

Anticipates and prevents problems - Applications need to be operational for extended periods of time. To reduce downtime, offerings need to be self-healing where possible so problems don't interrupt operations.

A validate button is available on the Parser and parser subelements. The action validates the completeness of the parser subcomponents by validating the content against the cbe schema

mandatory fields, an error message is logged and the CBE is not returned.  When
in the GLA editor the GLA formatter is only executed when the adapter file is
run and any missing CBE field errors found are displayed in the Problems view.

The GLA runtime cannot perform any validation on the CBE's it generates until it
tries to generate them during execution of the adapter.  The GLA only knows
about CBE's in the formatter and outputter components.  Checking for the
presence of rules for the mandatory CBE fields when the adapter is saved would
have to be done by the GLA editor UI.  It sounds like Lennart wants that kind of
CBE validation.
Please raise the priority to P2
Update component
Candidate for 4.2
Adding myself to cc list so I will get notified when "Design Summary" section of the design document is completed.
My comments in upper case:

In the GLA formatter component when it creates the CBE, it checks for all of the mandatory CBE fields before returning the CBE. If the CBE is missing mandatory fields, an error message is logged IN HGLA.LOG
Here's the user comment:

Q: 3A1 (2) Could this be improved by TPTP bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104487?
A: Yes.  CBE validation would improve this to a 3.  If the GLA would then tell the user what to update, this could potentially score higher. (i.e., don't just say "CBE Validation failed" but bring the user to the exact field that failed, provide a recommendation on how to correct the error, and allow the user to correct.)

Here's the definition for 3A1:

Anticipates and prevents problems - Applications need to be operational for extended periods of time. To reduce downtime, offerings need to be self-healing where possible so problems don't interrupt operations.

fixed

A validate button is available on the Parser and parser subelements. The action validates the completeness of the parser subcomponents by validating the content against the cbe schema

    <WithStack>I believe there is a problem with the way that images are handled for
TableItems when running on a Windows system with a reduced colour map.

Specifically, a GIF which is a solid colour that has an RGB value of
(76,178,76) - a sort of off-green - gets rendered as grey when it's
used as the image in a TableItem.  The same GIF file, in the same
application, displays correctly if it is used e.g. as the image for a
Button.

The program below creates a window that contains a button and a table;
for both button and table, I do a "setImage()" specifying the same
Image resource.  If I use a solid red square, the image is rendered
correctly in both cases.  If I use the green, then only the image on
the Button is OK.

This problem has been seen in various cases, all in situations where
the Windows system has minimal colours available, e.g. I can reproduce
it when using a remote desktop to a Windows system and specifying
8-bit colours.  Higher levels of colour don't see the problem.  I see
the problem with 3.0 and 3.1 Eclipse.

I hope this describes the problem OK, I can provide "redblob.gif" and
"greenblob.gif" if you want them.

for value type classes like

it would be useful to have a quick fix to create a constructor to init all those
fields.
Ie.
 	public A(int length, String name, int width) {
		this.length = length;
		this.name = name;
		this.width = width;
	}	

there's a separate source action for that but it's a little heavyweight for this. 

At least, a quick fix to *open* the 'Create Constructor using fields' could be
offered (pre-select the field checkboxes then, please)
I don't think we should add a quick fix for this specific task, since there are
too many unknowns to guess. The source action is IMO better suited since it asks
the relevant questions and gives more flexibility. And you can always assign a
keybinding to it ;-).

Moving to Martin to close or fix.

    <WithStack>It would be an interesting and very handy feature if Mylar would authomatically
switch active context, for example when user try to open or jump into some class
that is already in a lanmark of some other non active task. 

So, it would close unrelated editors and reopen those who hab been used with
selected task. That should improve user experience with task list quite a lot.

I imagine button on a Mylar tasklist view that would activate this
functionality, otherwise classes will be added to the current context.
This is a very neat idea, and I really like the notion of using landmarks to 
determine when a programmer has switched contexts without specifying or 
realizing it.

It'll be hard to get the UI right to start with, but we can iterate by 
incorporate feedback and usage data.  Let me know what you think of the 
following:
- you navigates to an element that is a landmark in another task context
- you're notified of the related contest by an in-place view (so that it's not 
modal and won't stick if you ignore) which shows the current task and the task
(s) containing landmarks for that element
- you now have the option of selecting the other task to have both active, or 
onloy one of the two active

Note that this will require Mylar core to support a large number of 'inactive' 
contexts that it can query, which is scheduled for 0.4 (August).

It also gives me another idea: what if we have an quick-key in-place popup 
that shows all the tasks contexts that you've had active, say in the past 5 
days or something, sorted by time that each has been active (we keep track of 
that).  That way switching between tasks should be as convenient as  hitting 
Ctrl+E to toggle between editors.  Think that would work?

I wonder if this will be too disruptive to the programmer to pop-up views, 
even if they are in-place. Some alternatives to consider might be to do so 
analysis in the background to determine the possibility that two contexts 
overlap. If the programmer moves to a different context with low likelihood of 
overlap, just switch to the other task automatically. Another approach (likely 
complementary) would be to use dependencies to predict which contexts the 
programmer means as they navigate to some place in a project and then if there 
is more than one possibility to add the interactions to each possible context 
speculatively, backing out of ones that become less likely. You'd probably 
still need to gather info from the programmer about which is right, but you 
might be able to delay until you are more sure.

I totally agree!

That is actually I've suggested an easily accessible switch on task view that
can activate task auto switching.

In a worst case user can just activate previous task again. You can probably
provide a back/forward actions to simplify that.

I also don't think that quck switch view is really needed. You supposely have
view all the time and it can be activated with Alt-Shift-Q or Ctrl-F7

(likely 
&gt; &gt; complementary) would be to use dependencies to predict which contexts the 
&gt; &gt; programmer means as they navigate to some place in a project and then if 
there

&gt; It sounds too complicated ad as a result difficult to understand for an 
average

Yup, its not simple, but not likely that complicated. Most of it would be 
hidden and its "success" would be only if it did the right thing a high 
proportion of the time and was somewhat obvious why it failed when it didn't.

What we need on the list (and this bug report provides) is a future 
enhancement for backing up on contexts so not matter what mechanism one can 
return to a previous point (although its not trivial to get a UI that allows 
one to specify "the right point").


Very interesting stuff!  So it sounds like this should lean towards being more 
implicit (e.g. no popups), be explicit about working implicitly (e.g. with a 
button to indicate that automatic context switching is enabled), and also be 
loud enough so that when it's wrong the user can back out of the switch.  

Eugene: personally I do always have the task list up, so don't see any need 
for a fast view either.  And thanks to the filters I don't usually see a 
scrollbar in my task list.  But even with just the explicit task switching 
support, I'm *really* starting to want the back/forward functionality that you 
suggest, and was tempted to add it a couple of weeks ago since we already have 
all the structure needed to make that work.  Could you submit a seperate 
enhancement request for that?  

Gail: in the long term I think you're hit the point on the head that this is 
about traversing through contexts, and related to this idea of rollback.  On 
the bright side the core already has the pieces to support this, since it can 
roll-back a context to a given event (e.g. a task activation, dunno, as you 
say figuring out what the right points are will be hard).  Also, while the 
core supports this, I think that making a good UI for it will be both very 
interesting and very hard.  It immediately makes mething of timelines and 
navigation trees for representing this aggregate "workspace context" that's 
composed of task contexts and punctuated by implicit or explicit task context 
switches.
Mik, do you want to reopen this discussion?
What I would like is for us to try out the simplest thing first: automatically activating a task when a bug is opened.  An enabler for this is that we no longer go to the server on open.  What I think we need for this to work well is:

1) Task activation needs to do a more thorough restore of the UI, probably right down to maintaining editor locations.  This may be possible with Eclipse's editor mementosl, but it would really help if they gave us bug 138666

2) Activation needs to become way faster.  The above bug would take care of most of that.  If we keep contexts zipped on disk that should take care of the time doing IO.

In order for us to start experimenting with this I'm bumping the priority of the long-standing bug 125938.  Once we have some experience with this let's consider the implicit activation of tasks.
It looks like a typo in above bug number.

    <WithOutStack>It would be an interesting and very handy feature if Mylar would authomatically
switch active context, for example when user try to open or jump into some class
that is already in a lanmark of some other non active task. 

So, it would close unrelated editors and reopen those who hab been used with
selected task. That should improve user experience with task list quite a lot.

I imagine button on a Mylar tasklist view that would activate this
functionality, otherwise classes will be added to the current context.
This is a very neat idea, and I really like the notion of using landmarks to 
determine when a programmer has switched contexts without specifying or 
realizing it.

It'll be hard to get the UI right to start with, but we can iterate by 
incorporate feedback and usage data.  Let me know what you think of the 
following:
- you navigates to an element that is a landmark in another task context
- you're notified of the related contest by an in-place view (so that it's not 
modal and won't stick if you ignore) which shows the current task and the task
(s) containing landmarks for that element
- you now have the option of selecting the other task to have both active, or 
onloy one of the two active

Note that this will require Mylar core to support a large number of 'inactive' 
contexts that it can query, which is scheduled for 0.4 (August).

It also gives me another idea: what if we have an quick-key in-place popup 
that shows all the tasks contexts that you've had active, say in the past 5 
days or something, sorted by time that each has been active (we keep track of 
that).  That way switching between tasks should be as convenient as  hitting 
Ctrl+E to toggle between editors.  Think that would work?

I wonder if this will be too disruptive to the programmer to pop-up views, 
even if they are in-place. Some alternatives to consider might be to do so 
analysis in the background to determine the possibility that two contexts 
overlap. If the programmer moves to a different context with low likelihood of 
overlap, just switch to the other task automatically. Another approach (likely

I totally agree!

That is actually I've suggested an easily accessible switch on task view that
can activate task auto switching.

In a worst case user can just activate previous task again. You can probably
provide a back/forward actions to simplify that.

I also don't think that quck switch view is really needed. You supposely have
view all the time and it can be activated with Alt-Shift-Q or Ctrl-F7

Truncations
TVT bugs being deferred to M8....
I cannot reproduce this problem in the listed locales (Hungarian, Czech and 
German). The buttons are not truncated in half.
It could be the screen resolution.  They are running at 1024x768, what are you 
running at?
I'm running 1024x768 as well. RHEL 3.
code is in CVS
The trunction is still present in the following languages:

Czech
Hungarian
Japanese
German

The truncation is still at the lower part of all three buttons and the right
hand side of the middle button.  This cannot be fixed by adjusting translation,
either the font size of the button text needs to be decreased or the buttons
need to be made larger.
Neeraj, I notice there are 0.7.1 changes in the following plug-ins that have 
not been released to the 0.7.1 map files:

org.eclipse.jst.common.navigator.java
org.eclipse.wst.common.frameworks.ui

Since there's no "HEAD" builds in the 0.7.1 stream, we must release our changes 
in order to get them into a build. Should the above change be released?
We need the fix. This is a must  fix problem for tester.
The fix was dropped in M8, is this what you used for testing?
This is a English version problem as well in Linux.  Therefore, this is not a
TVT bug.  I will attach a screenshot from the English version.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 104850 ***
Neeraj, please see Jeff's comment 7.  This needs to be in 0.7.1.  The M8 
target milestone is for 1.0.  I believe the M7.1 target milestone is for 0.7.1
One of the things that we are confused about right now is the screen shot 
posted on 08/16. Can Matt or Steve clarify whether that screen shot is just bad 
and we should ignore it?
I tried this scenario on both WinXP and RHEL 3.0, I cannot reproduce the 
problem. Perhaps this is one of those font size/resolution issues?
The screen shot in comment 12 looks wrong to me too.  Matt, please update as 
appropriate.
