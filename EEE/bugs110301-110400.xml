    <WithStack>When deleting components ('delete content'), the buckminster metadata is not
updated (i.e. removed)
Apparently, a persistent property on a resource is removed prior to the
PRE_BUILD and POST_CHANGE events and there are no other events that are sent
when a resource is removed. Hence, there's no way to register an event handler
that traps the removal of a resource that has a certain property assigned.

A redesign of the WorkspaceInfo was needed in order to keep track of the
resources that reflect a component. We now maintain a Map in memory. Each time a
resource is removed, it's full path (relative to the workspace) is used as the
key for a lookup in this map. If a corresponding UUID is found, then we know
that the resource is a component.

    <WithStack>Although it seems not to be an official 'style', some people write:
     return(expression);
rather than
     return expression;

At the moment there is no control over the 'return' format, but
automatically a space is retained after the keyword.
As such is implemented for 'methods' there should be an entry that
controls 'return' in the same way with respect to white space anywhere.
;JOOP!
The space is optional only if the following expression is a parenthesized
expression or a cast expression.
Do you see another case that should be supported?

If the space is optional, then why does the formatter add it in any case?

    methodCall(n);     // Can be parameterised to remain as this.
    return(version);   // No way to prevent insertion of a space.
Ctrl/F :
    methodCall(n);     // Can be parameterised to remain as this.
    return (version);   // No way to prevent insertion of a space.
;JOOP!
I didn't say it was already optional.
I am simply saying that if we make it optional, this option would work only for
cast and parameterized expressions. For other types of expression, the space is
mandatory.

Well, if it would solve the sample I gave, I should be satisfied.

Fixed and released in HEAD.
Regression case added in
org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.formatter.FormatterRegressionTests.test606.
This needs to be added in the code formatter preference page. See bug 111139.
I will rename the option
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BEFORE_PARENTESIZED_EXPRESSION_IN_RETURN.

Fixed and released. Adapted regression tests. Nothing is done for cast
expression, prefix expressions or string literals.

    <WithStack>Most projects in the Eclipse bugzilla are pure Java. Yet, the defaults for
Hardware and OS in the bug-entry page are set according to the configuration on
the reporters machine (at least I think it is). I think a more sane default for
both of those values would be 'All'.

If the fields should be interpreted as 'The bug only happens on this
hardware/OS', then there's a *lot* of bugs incorrectly entered today due to the
defaults.

Even projects that are not entirely pure Java (platform and swt comes to mind)
probably have very few bugs that truly are related to a specific hardware or OS.
My guess is that they too would benefit from a default of 'All'.
&gt; If the fields should be interpreted as 'The bug only happens on this
&gt; hardware/OS', then there's a *lot* of bugs incorrectly entered today due to the
&gt; defaults.

i nterpret it rather as "i do experience that bug on that platform" -- there are probably very 
few people using eclipse on all supported platforms and thus being able to report a well-founded 
"all" as platform.

but generally i think a bug-report-wizard from inside eclipse would be far better (as most kde-
applications do). there should be an entry in e g "help" called "report new bug" which opens a 
browser with the bugzilla using application-specific informations (hardware, os, version, ...) 
thus ensuring the integrity and reliabilty of these informations. 
(In reply to comment #1)
&gt; i nterpret it rather as "i do experience that bug on that platform"
&gt;
But using Java you are in &gt; 90% of the cases likely to experience it on other
platforms as well. Look at this feature request. Who cares if I entered it using
my PC and Windows XP?

IMHO, those fields should be set when it *matters*. Not otherwise.

&gt; there are probably very few people using eclipse on all supported platforms
&gt; and thus being able to report a well-founded "all" as platform.
&gt; 
That's just the point. Nobody can make that claim. 'All' is equal to 'does not
apply'. In essence, if you don't know, don't enter the information. A value of
'N/A' would be even better.

&gt; using application-specific informations (hardware, os, version, ...)
&gt; thus ensuring the integrity and reliabilty of these informations. 

That's an exceptionally great idea. Perhaps another feature request?

I agree that in many cases, the OS doesn't matter. However, I think you are 
underestimating how often it is relevant. There are many UI and file system 
subtleties that arise on various platforms. As a component maintainer, I 
prefer to be able to see from what platform the bug originated. I can then 
make the call as to whether the bug is relevant on multiple platforms. I would 
definitly NOT be happy if the default for hardware and OS were changed to be 
ALL by default.
-1 !!

The hardware and OS fields should be interpreted as, "this is the environment in
which I encountered the bug".  The bug owner can decide whether they believe
that is relevant to the bug in question.  Changing the default to "all" would
effectively throw away information that may prove to be valuable in some cases.
 I agree that for lots of Java code with no JNI component, this information does
not turn out to be useful.  However, as the maintainer of a large amount of file
system I/O code, I can say that the behavioral differences across OSes and
hardware is often significant, and I would be thrown in the dark by losing this
information.  You may argue that the reporter can set this information later if
it matters, but in many cases the reportor simply doesn't respond to follow-up
questions, so we need to gather as much information as possible in the initial
report.
I guess it all depends on how you interpret the fields. I've always read them as:
"If you know that your problem is specific to this platform, then enter the
information". I can see how your interpretation makes a lot of sense too so I'm
closing this request.

I think we should get an error 'Type T cant be found' and it should be possible
to provide a default implementation for a generic method specified on an interface.

====

I have an error in ExtendProduct aspect on method getTarget(). I give
the code below
Does somebody have an idea?
This error is :
can't override Link&lt;Revision&gt; AssociationSource&lt;Revision&gt;.getTarget()
with Link&lt;T&gt; AssociationSource.getTarget() return types don't match

Moreover, one advice having a generic type of return gives a similar error.
Was this feature implemented in the last version of apectj.
Thanks.

This sample code :

public class Link&lt;T&gt; extends SoftReference {

       }

       public void AssociationSource.setTarget(Link&lt;T&gt; _target) {

       declare parents : Product     implements AssociationSource&lt;Branch&gt;;
       declare parents : Branch      implements
AssociationSource&lt;Revision&gt;;
}
Ok, i've started on this bug - on my way to looking at the real problem I'm
failing with an NPE for this program:

import java.lang.annotation.*;
import java.lang.ref.*;

class Product{}
class ProductType{}

       public Link&lt;T&gt; AssociationSource.getTarget() {

   @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
   public List&lt;T&gt; getEndPoints() {
       return (List&lt;T&gt;)get();
   }

}

The types 'Branch' and 'Revision' are missing from the program, but that
shouldnt cause:

6 errors

The NPE is fixed.

The other problem occurs because we don't parameterize ITDs for application to a
particular type.  E.g.

List&lt;T&gt; I&lt;T&gt;.foo() { return null; }

when a type A that looks like this:

class A implements I&lt;String&gt; {}

has matched, should be targetted with a parameterized form of the ITD:

List&lt;String&gt; I.foo() { return null; }

i'm in progress of fixing this.
I've created multiple cases for this problem, they are in CVS and I'm working
through them - the full description of what I am doing is going into bug 112105
Fixed all interesting cases covered by this bug ... bug 112105 will now continue
the ITD generics work.  Closing this one when build is through...
yey!  fix available.</WithStack>

The NPE is fixed.

The other problem occurs because we don't parameterize ITDs for application to a
particular type.  E.g.

List&lt;T&gt; I&lt;T&gt;.foo() { return null; }

when a type A that looks like this:

class A implements I&lt;String&gt; {}

has matched, should be targetted with a parameterized form of the ITD:

List&lt;String&gt; I.foo() { return null; }

i'm in progress of fixing this.
I've created multiple cases for this problem, they are in CVS and I'm working
through them - the full description of what I am doing is going into bug 112105
Fixed all interesting cases covered by this bug ... bug 112105 will now continue
the ITD generics work.  Closing this one when build is through...
yey!  fix available.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Making use of the javaw.exe.manifest file to apply the Windows XP look-and-
feel to SWT controls is causing some weird rendering behavior in some SWT 
controls in the attached plugin.  Some effects are seen when 
javaw.exe.manifest is copied to the JRE (1.4.2) bin directory, and others are 
seen if javaw.exe.manifest is copied and renamed to java.exe.manifest.  Having 
both files present (java.exe.manifest and javaw.exe.manifest) causes both 
types of problems to appear at once.  

Attached plugin makes use of a TabFolder and also a ScrolledForm 
(org.eclipse.ui.forms.widgets) containing Label and Text controls.  

No manifest file used:  
All controls rendered properly.  No problems here, except that Windows XP look-
and-feel is not used.

javaw.exe.manifest file used: 
Windows XP look-and-feel doesn't seem to be applied used, but the Text 
controls in the ScrolledForm have become varying heights, resulting in the 
text within to be cut off.  Tabs on TabFolder are unaffected.

java.exe.manifest file used: 
Windows XP look-and-feel is applied, but the tabs on the TabFolder are 
rendered upside down.  Text controls in the ScrolledForm are unaffected.

Both manifest files used: 
Windows XP look-and-feel is applied, but now both problems exist.

See attached screenshots for more detail (affected areas highlighted).  

Plugin (including source) is also attached.

This error was originally found on an Eclipse 3.0.2-based product, but was 
checked against 3.1 and found there as well.  If any fix is proposed, would 
like to have a version for 3.0.2 as well.

The appearance of the tabs with the java.exe.manifest is a duplicate of bug
87540.  You should add yourself to this bug report.

As far as the problem you are seeing when javaw.exe.manifest is present, this
seems to be a bug a UI Forms.  UI Forms is using the file "javaw.exe.manifest"
as an indicator that the Windows Theme is in effect  This is incorrect. The
manifest file must match the executable used to launch the application.  In your
case you are launching with java (not javaw) and therefore the UI forms should
be looking for java.exe.manifest.  Alternatively, you could try launching your
application with javaw instead of java.

However, I think you are going to have trouble even with javaw.  The reason is
that your FormAttatchments are using fixed heights for the labels and text
widgets.  This is bad use of the FormLayout.  If the user has specified a
different default font (which happens with different WIndows themes) or is
running on a different operating system, these fixed heights will be wrong and
most likely text will be clipped.  I have modified your form attatchments below
to use the default height of the widgets

While I agree that a best practice here would not be setting the heights of 
the text and label widgets, the code that this was based on was originally 
generated by a visual SWT editor (Instantiations SWT Designer), which seems to 
have automatically put the heights on the controls.  In the screenshots 
provided, the font has not changed, but the heights certainly seem to have 
changed.  

So are you stating that the height "squishing" (for lack of a better term) is 
not a bug, but a design issue?

If that's the case, then the bugs here are the tab issue (dup of bug 87540, 
like you mentioned) and the UI forms issue where it assumes javaw.exe.manifest 
is always the theme indicator (instead of checking for the actual java 
executable used during launch).  Is this correct?  
The height of the widget is determined not only by the font size. It is up to 
the theme how much padding it wishes to put around the text, sometimes space 
is left for a groovy effect when the widget is "hot" (mouse enters the bounds 
of the widget) etc.

For you, on one hand borders were drawn by the OS and on the other hand they 
were drawn by UI Forms. If the code was generated with UIForms drawing the 
border then the widget was probably sized to not have borders (created with 
style SWT.NONE) and UIForms would draw the border on the parent.  Now you run 
the code with the manifest and the borders are included in the widget (created 
with style SWT.BORDER).  The space needed by the widget for the borders is 
subtracted from the total height making the internal text area squished.

In general, hard coding sizes is an extremely non-portable way of writing a 
GUI.  Are you sure Instantiations SWT Designer always hard codes these values?
Not sure about SWT Designer.  The code originated from a customer using that 
tool.
Veronika, was a bug ever filed about the UI forms issue in comment #6?  I noticed that bug 105056 describes the same issue, and I bet there are more.

Please note that :
- My dynamic web projects are in CVS
- They have been check-in from a Windows platform. (exactly same eclipse version)
- There is a project dependency on a normal java project (the java sources)
- It only fails on a linux platform. The people on Windows can create war files
just fine.

Please have a look,

I have found the source of my error.

When I checked out the project from CVS, the "Java JAR Dependencies" of my 
project on the other project were not checked.
This is rather strange because the person who checked in the project had it 
checked.

After activating this dependency, the .deployables directory was correctly 
filled out and the exporting to WAR-file worked.

Perhaps it would be nice to give a more "user friendly" error message should 
this error occur.

Anyway, it works for me.

Greetings,

Thanks for verifying. Closing bug.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Arthur will extract information from Bugzilla and autmatically merge it with 
the manually written milestone_plan.xml information to produce integrated 
reports. If the Bugzilla information is acceptable, we can reduce some 
duplication of effort.
Accepted.
I've generated buglist-report.html documents that list the bugs for each
component and target milestone. The reports link to the milestone plan items and
report discrepencies.
I've now linked these reports from the /webtools/plans/1.0/ index page. I'm
marking this as done. However, I'd like to use PHP to apply the stylesheets but
I need the Webmaster to enable it. Vote for bug 112149.

    <WithStack>Arthur will reorganize the Web site as per the proposal on the mailing list:

Some of you have complained about the current process for updating the 
milestone and test plans since it involves checking out and building the entire 
Web site, which is now too bulky. Also, all Eclipse projects have been asked to 
clean up their sites so that the old plans are not cluttering up the Web pages. 

We have been holding off doing a major reorg of the Web site because the entire 
Eclipse Web site is going to be upgraded by the Phoenix project. However, we 
need to update our 1.0 and 1.5 plans now and can't wait any longer for Phoenix. 

This note proposes a new structure, cooked up by Lawrence and me, that will 
address the build problem and simplify cleanup at the end of each release. 
Please review it and respond by Thursday. In the absence of any objections 
voiced at our status call on Thursday, we'll proceed with the plan.

1. We will keep the 0.7 plans in the current structure to avoid broken links. 
These pages will be moved after Phoenix gives us automatic redirection 
capability. 

2. We will create a new directory structure for all current and future plans, 
as follows:

/webtools/plans/&lt;release&gt;/&lt;subproject&gt;/&lt;component&gt;/&lt;milestone&gt;/

The directory will contain only the milestone and test plans for that component 
and milestone. For example,

/webtools/plans/1.0/wst/server/M8/milestone_plan.xml

contains the milestone plan for M8 of the server component of WST in WTP 1.0.

3. Each release will be a project and have a build script. You'll only have to 
check out the release portion of the Web site from CVS to update your plans. 
The build script will roll up your component plans into the master plans. For 
example, to update the plans for WTP 1.0, check out the project:

/webtools/plans/1.0

4. Tutorials will go into the community part of the Web site and be kept 
current, i.e. we will not keep tutorials for all milestones, just the current 
one. Users will be expected to upgrade to the latest milestone.

5. There are some very bulky UML models with generated HTML. These will stay in 
the old directory structure. However, the source for the model (not the 
generated HTML) should be checked into the development CVS repository, NOT the 
Web site CVS. The HTML for the model will always be up to date, i.e we will not 
have versions of the models for each milestone since they are too bulky and are 
more like Javadoc than normal Web pages. If you need an old version of a model, 
get it from the dev CVS.

6. Design docs will stay in the old directory structure and always reflect the 
current milestone, i.e. we do not have per milestone design docs. The source 
for the design docs should be checked in with the Java source code in the dev 
CVS.

7. The API Javadoc will be removed from the Web site and packaged in the 
Eclipse Online Help system Web site. We will add a redirect to the new location.

8. The top level Web pages will point to the current plans. We will also have a 
page for the archived and future plans.

The above guidelines will keep the milestone-dependent parts of the Web site 
lean and easy to update.
Accepted. Work has begun.
I have moved all the WTP 1.0 milestone and test plans into /webtools/plans/1.0
and updated all the links to these plans from /webtools/jst and /webtools/wst.

Next step is to verify that /webtools/plans/1.0 can be checked out as a project
and built independently.
The WTP 1.0 plans can now be checked out as a project and built independently.

The next step is to add the plans to the milestone overview and generate the
reports. Then update the links to all the reports to point to the 1.0 plans.
Part of a mass update. Based on 9/22/2005 development review meeting, it's 
determined this was an open bug/enhancement with tartget mistakenly set to M8. 
Since this will not be in M8, I am changing to "unspecified". 

If this is an error, please correct (for example the bug really has been fixed
in M8, change back to M8, and "fixed".)

The reorg is complete. However, the milestone plans will continue to be 
refined. I will be adding reports generated from Bugzilla. See bug 110312. I am 
closing this action item now.

current milestone, i.e. we do not have per milestone design docs. The source 
for the design docs should be checked in with the Java source code in the dev 
CVS.

7. The API Javadoc will be removed from the Web site and packaged in the 
Eclipse Online Help system Web site. We will add a redirect to the new location.

8. The top level Web pages will point to the current plans. We will also have a 
page for the archived and future plans.

The above guidelines will keep the milestone-dependent parts of the Web site 
lean and easy to update.
Accepted. Work has begun.
I have moved all the WTP 1.0 milestone and test plans into /webtools/plans/1.0
and updated all the links to these plans from /webtools/jst and /webtools/wst.

Next step is to verify that /webtools/plans/1.0 can be checked out as a project
and built independently.
The WTP 1.0 plans can now be checked out as a project and built independently.

The next step is to add the plans to the milestone overview and generate the
reports. Then update the links to all the reports to point to the 1.0 plans.
Part of a mass update. Based on 9/22/2005 development review meeting, it's 
determined this was an open bug/enhancement with tartget mistakenly set to M8. 
Since this will not be in M8, I am changing to "unspecified". 

If this is an error, please correct (for example the bug really has been fixed
in M8, change back to M8, and "fixed".)

The reorg is complete. However, the milestone plans will continue to be 
refined. I will be adding reports generated from Bugzilla. See bug 110312. I am 
closing this action item now.

    <WithStack>Lawrence will reorganize the tutorials as per the following proposal which was 
discussed on the mailing list:

Some of you have complained about the current process for updating the 
milestone and test plans since it involves checking out and building the entire 
Web site, which is now too bulky. Also, all Eclipse projects have been asked to 
clean up their sites so that the old plans are not cluttering up the Web pages. 

We have been holding off doing a major reorg of the Web site because the entire 
Eclipse Web site is going to be upgraded by the Phoenix project. However, we 
need to update our 1.0 and 1.5 plans now and can't wait any longer for Phoenix. 

This note proposes a new structure, cooked up by Lawrence and me, that will 
address the build problem and simplify cleanup at the end of each release. 
Please review it and respond by Thursday. In the absence of any objections 
voiced at our status call on Thursday, we'll proceed with the plan.

1. We will keep the 0.7 plans in the current structure to avoid broken links. 
These pages will be moved after Phoenix gives us automatic redirection 
capability. 

2. We will create a new directory structure for all current and future plans, 
as follows:

/webtools/plans/&lt;release&gt;/&lt;subproject&gt;/&lt;component&gt;/&lt;milestone&gt;/

The directory will contain only the milestone and test plans for that component 
and milestone. For example,

/webtools/plans/1.0/wst/server/M8/milestone_plan.xml

contains the milestone plan for M8 of the server component of WST in WTP 1.0.

3. Each release will be a project and have a build script. You'll only have to 
check out the release portion of the Web site from CVS to update your plans. 
The build script will roll up your component plans into the master plans. For 
example, to update the plans for WTP 1.0, check out the project:

/webtools/plans/1.0

4. Tutorials will go into the community part of the Web site and be kept 
current, i.e. we will not keep tutorials for all milestones, just the current 
one. Users will be expected to upgrade to the latest milestone.

5. There are some very bulky UML models with generated HTML. These will stay in 
the old directory structure. However, the source for the model (not the 
generated HTML) should be checked into the development CVS repository, NOT the 
Web site CVS. The HTML for the model will always be up to date, i.e we will not 
have versions of the models for each milestone since they are too bulky and are 
more like Javadoc than normal Web pages. If you need an old version of a model, 
get it from the dev CVS.

8. The top level Web pages will point to the current plans. We will also have a 
page for the archived and future plans.

The above guidelines will keep the milestone-dependent parts of the Web site 
lean and easy to update.
I've relocated the WTP tutorial content under community/tutorials. All tutorials
are self contained in their own folder for easy maintenance.

    <WithStack>I am using eclipse 3.2M1. But this phenomenon was seen in R3.1 as well.
 
for no apparent reason eclipse did not allow me to Open Project for closed 
Project sometimes, the context menu item was grayed out, or even had no "Open 
Project" context menu item. Afte restart the Eclipse, I could solve this 
problem. But it will come back after restarting of eclipse several times.

This problem seem to appear randomly but some times per day. So I hope Eclipse 
team can do some researches on this problem, and solve it. I like Eclipse very 
much:)

Notes: 
my OS - XP
JDK - JAVA 5 (maybe it's the problem?I will test this)
If need, I could provide some snapshots about this problem:)
I believe this is a dupe but I can't find the original bug.  I THOUGHT it had been fixed some time ago, 
possibly in the 3.1 timeframe.
Can you attach your error log?

Created attachment 27415
snapshot 02 of this problem (normal condition)
My Eclipse SDK version(3.2M1):
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050811-1530

In fact, I found this problem before several months when I use R3.1. I guessed 
it could be reported and fixed in 3.2M1. But not^_^ Yesterday I met a thread in 
a IBM web forum which said the same problem. So, I believe it's not a 
individual case:) 

I guess 2 reasons for this problem:
1&gt;Java5?(I using JDK 1.5.0_05-b05, but I have met this problem under 
b02/b03/b04)
2&gt;plugin conflict?(But Most of plugins of my using is delivered to R3.1)

this looks a lot like bug 68179 
I recheck the error log and make some tests. I highly guess this is the plugin 
conflict problem. I am using oxygen 6.1 plugin to deal with xml files. Today I 
disabled/re-enabled the oxygen. I have not met this phenomenon again. So, maybe 
it's just a small problem(due to the plugin, not the Eclipse itself^_^). I will 
make more tests recently. I hope the bug could be closed soon^_^
Today I make more tests. I am very sure that the oxygen xml editor plugin crash 
the "Open Project" context item of Eclipse. It should be not the bug of 
Eclipse. Sorry for disturbing. I like Eclipse really^_^ How to close this bug 
thread?I think it can be closed^_^
Closing this bug as INVALID as the bug is being logged against a different
product.  Thank you for investigating and clarifying this issue.</WithStack>

Project sometimes, the context menu item was grayed out, or even had no "Open 
Project" context menu item. Afte restart the Eclipse, I could solve this 
problem. But it will come back after restarting of eclipse several times.

This problem seem to appear randomly but some times per day. So I hope Eclipse 
team can do some researches on this problem, and solve it. I like Eclipse very 
much:)

Notes: 
my OS - XP
JDK - JAVA 5 (maybe it's the problem?I will test this)
If need, I could provide some snapshots about this problem:)
I believe this is a dupe but I can't find the original bug.  I THOUGHT it had been fixed some time ago, 
possibly in the 3.1 timeframe.
Can you attach your error log? 
 
(In reply to comment #2)
&gt; Can you attach your error log?

snapshot 01 of this problem (nonnormal condition)
Created attachment 27415
snapshot 02 of this problem (normal condition)
My Eclipse SDK version(3.2M1):
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050811-1530

In fact, I found this problem before several months when I use R3.1. I guessed 
it could be reported and fixed in 3.2M1. But not^_^ Yesterday I met a thread in 
a IBM web forum which said the same problem. So, I believe it's not a 
individual case:) 

I guess 2 reasons for this problem:
1&gt;Java5?(I using JDK 1.5.0_05-b05, but I have met this problem under 
b02/b03/b04)
2&gt;plugin conflict?(But Most of plugins of my using is delivered to R3.1)

this looks a lot like bug 68179 
I recheck the error log and make some tests. I highly guess this is the plugin 
conflict problem. I am using oxygen 6.1 plugin to deal with xml files. Today I 
disabled/re-enabled the oxygen. I have not met this phenomenon again. So, maybe 
it's just a small problem(due to the plugin, not the Eclipse itself^_^). I will 
make more tests recently. I hope the bug could be closed soon^_^
Today I make more tests. I am very sure that the oxygen xml editor plugin crash 
the "Open Project" context item of Eclipse. It should be not the bug of 
Eclipse. Sorry for disturbing. I like Eclipse really^_^ How to close this bug 
thread?I think it can be closed^_^
Closing this bug as INVALID as the bug is being logged against a different
product.  Thank you for investigating and clarifying this issue.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>As discussed at the JDT summit here some use cases for AST recovery.

- statement recovery
  
  foo() ==&gt; foo();

- method invocation recovery

  foo(10, ==&gt; foo(10) or foo(10, null, ...) where null is the default value for
  the missing parameters.

  Having this recovery allows selecting 10 and extract it to a local or method
  without completing the invocation.
- anonymous class recovery

Runnable runnable= new Runnable() {
   ru&lt;Ctrl+Space&gt;

    <WithOutStack>As discussed at the JDT summit here some use cases for AST recovery.

- statement recovery
  
  foo() ==&gt; foo();

- method invocation recovery

  foo(10, ==&gt; foo(10) or foo(10, null, ...) where null is the default value for
  the missing parameters.

  Having this recovery allows selecting 10 and extract it to a local or method
  without completing the invocation.
- anonymous class recovery

Runnable runnable= new Runnable() {
   ru&lt;Ctrl+Space&gt;
}

should still return node and binding for anonymous class

WSAD or WTP?
No response to the question from Chuck, and we have had no similar reports and
several positive tests of the TCP/IP monitor.

If this is a WTP issue and you can still reproduce, please reopen a give further
details into what the problem is.
This bug was moved to 'closed' state, since it is so old is is assumed its dup, invalid, or worksforme resolution is no longer in qustion and the bugzilla needs no further attention. Feel free to re-open, or open a new bug, if this semi-automatic processing was done in error in this case.</WithStack>

The search engine should optionaly return the local variable when searching for
reference to a type.

This should be an option (flag on SearchEngine#search(...) ?) and the local
variable should be returned using a new API (SearchMatch#getReferingElement()
?), SearchMatch#getElement() should still return the enclosing method.
*** Bug 111215 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Note that bug 111225 wants type parameters as enclosing elements as well.
Type parameters are currently not a requirement, but I think it would be more
consistent if those would be resolved as well.
We should try to deliver this soon, so UI can leverage this within M4.

Patch to implement this functionality

Note that this is a workspace patch which contains 2 projects:
  - org.eclipse.jdt.core
  - org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.model
I just tried the patch and it works fine for temporaries and variables in for loops, but it seems getLocalElement() returns null for method parameters and exception variables:

public class Foo extends Exception { &lt;-- search for references to "Foo"
	void foo(Foo foo) { // &lt;- no local element
		Foo foo2; // &lt;- local element
		
		try {
			throw new Foo();
		}

		for(Foo foo3;;) {} // &lt;- local element

New version to implement this functionality

New version after a loooong discussion with Markus... ;-)

Main changes are:
1) SearchRequestor is unchanged. That means that search engine *always* reports 
   local element (and other elements, see below...).
   Note that this behavior may change if performance tests (not written yet)
   show that it's too much time consuming...
2) localElement is now implemented only on TypeReferenceMatch instead of
   SearchMatch. This change has been done to avoid pollution of existing other
   kind of matches as currently only type reference matches need it.
3) Add otherElements on TypeReferenceMatch to address multiple fields
   declaration. Search engine reported only one match for type reference on
   multiple fields declaration which was problematic for this refactoring
   functionality.
   Markus, note that I didn't create subclasses as we talked about. While
   implementing it sounds that other elements may also be implemented at this
   level as they can also be considered as specific information of a type
   reference match.
4) I fixed problems with method parameters and catch exception declaration.
If I see that right, getOtherElements() will return either IFields (additional elements) or ILocalVariables (additional localElements). This should be documented, e.g.:
/**
 * Returns other enclosing elements of this search match.
 *
 * If {@link #getLocalElement()} is not &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, these may be other
 * local elements such as additional local variables of a multiple local
 * variables declaration. Otherwise, these may be other elements such as
 * additional fields of a multiple fields declaration.
 * 
 * @return the other elements of the search match, or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if none
 */
Thanks! 

One more thing: Local variables inside initializers are not yet reported (local element is null).

    <WithStack>It is currently difficult to read the macro that is included in plain text in
the test suite editor.

A 4th page should be included that displays the macro in a styled text with
proper colouring and formatting.  A tree representation of the xml fragment
would also be useful.
Moving the priority to 1.

I suspect you don't use EMF for this editor.
Would be better if you can create a schema for the macro XML and use EMF to generate the editor (based on EMF.Edit and EMF.Editor frameworks), you'll get a very rich editor with undo/redo capabilities and Properies view integration.

The tree view includes the shell and the individual commands that fall under them.  e.g. The user modifying a text box and pressing the ok button on the dialog will appear as:

TestCase
  |__ Wizard Dialog ID
          |__ modify (Line Number: x-x)
          |__ select (Line Number: x-x)


Why do you need + decorator on the leaf nodes?
The leaf nodes don't have a + on them.
You're probably talking about "CreateProbeFile", "WorkingWithProbesAndImports", and etc...
These aren't leaf nodes.  They're test cases. 
The leaf nodes are item-select, select, modify, etc...

Turning off Firewall in XP fixed the problem, although attempting to modify 
firewall settings to not affect eclipse didn't work (unless I'd missed or not 
done something properly).


I've found that PDFs seem to have a similar issue.  Given you have the Firewall 
on, if you start the IDE, go to Help, and try to print a PDF will fail and 
you'll get the message:
"The document could not be printed."
At the moment, I'm only getting this failure on the first attempt to print 
since last starting the IDE. After the failed attempt, I can print w/o 
problems.  However, I did earlier (and I don't now) get the "Can't print" 
behaviour repeatedly until I tried printing the same page again in which case 
it seems to have switched to this new improved behaviour.
Similar to the HTML issue, it seems that whether you block or unblock, you can 
only count on ~100% printing reliability if you turn off the XP firewall.
This problem didn't occur on Win2000-SP4.

    <WithStack>If I want to fiddle with the layout of an object, it seems unnatural to have to
change the layout property in the properties view, and then go to "Customize
Layout" to set other stuff.
Noel,
All the properties of a layout are in available in the property sheet (PS) view.
If there are properties missing in the PS and are in the Customize Window for
that layout, this is a bug. Please note them here and I'll aim to fix them in
the next release.

For layout settings and manipulation, the PS is the very basic way to change to
the properties of either the containers layout or the layout "constraints" of
the children (e.g. "NORTH", "SOUTH", etc. for BorderLayout). 
VE provides the Customize Window for certain layouts in order to help categorize
and display some of the most commonly edited properties of either the layout or
the contraints. For example, the GridBagConstraints used for children of a
container with GridBagLayout can be fairly complex, so all the properties are
provided in the Customize Window with visual helps (such as the compass for the
anchor property).
Of course, VE provides settings by just drag/drop and moving components within
these containers. The Customize Window is there for settings that can't be done
alone in the graph view through manipulating the components.
If you have suggestions for how the VE can improve the user experience in this
area, please add them to this bug report.
Thanks... Peter Walker
I guess I am just used to the Netbeans VE, which has a drop-down for changing
the layout manager on the "customize layout" dialog.

It just seems counter-intuitive to have to go somewhere else.

(I am not saying that the property-sheet should not display the layoutManager
property - just that when I right click "customize layout" and I can't change
the layout, at first I was very confused.)
Sorry... I misunderstood the problem. I thought you were talking about changing
the properties of a specific layout. 
And yes... you are correct in that it is very inconvenient to have to change the
layout in the property sheet and then go to the Customize Layout window to work
with it more.

In VE 1.2, we have made changes to improve this:
There are separate VE preferences pages for both Swing and SWT that allows you
to select the default layout manager you would like to use when you drop a
container (e.g. JPanel). So instead of using the default FlowLayout (default
layout manager for JPanel), you can select GridBagLayout as your default.
Also, to make it easier to change the layout once you've dropped it the
container, a drop down menu was added next to the toolbar action on the main
Eclipse toolbar for 'Customize Layout'. This drop down meny works the same as
the property sheet drop down menu for the 'layout' property.

What I believe you are suggesting here is to add the capability to change the
layout from the Customize Layout window itself. This is a good suggestion and
we'll look at it for an enhancement in 1.2.
One additional capability I failed to mention is a 'Set Layout' cascading menu
tha was added to the context menu of the container... allowing you another way
to change the layout manager without having to go to the property sheet view.
All these changes were recently added and should be available in the next 1.2 build.
Peter,
In the current HEAD the "Set layout&gt;" is not on the Container/Composite sub 
menu any more.  There is a drop down list beside the button that launches the

    <WithOutStack>If I want to fiddle with the layout of an object, it seems unnatural to have to
change the layout property in the properties view, and then go to "Customize
Layout" to set other stuff.
Noel,
All the properties of a layout are in available in the property sheet (PS) view.
If there are properties missing in the PS and are in the Customize Window for
that layout, this is a bug. Please note them here and I'll aim to fix them in
the next release.

For layout settings and manipulation, the PS is the very basic way to change to
the properties of either the containers layout or the layout "constraints" of
the children (e.g. "NORTH", "SOUTH", etc. for BorderLayout). 
VE provides the Customize Window for certain layouts in order to help categorize
and display some of the most commonly edited properties of either the layout or
the contraints. For example, the GridBagConstraints used for children of a
container with GridBagLayout can be fairly complex, so all the properties are
provided in the Customize Window with visual helps (such as the compass for the
anchor property).
Of course, VE provides settings by just drag/drop and moving components within
these containers. The Customize Window is there for settings that can't be done
alone in the graph view through manipulating the components.
If you have suggestions for how the VE can improve the user experience in this
area, please add them to this bug report.
Thanks... Peter Walker
I guess I am just used to the Netbeans VE, which has a drop-down for changing
the layout manager on the "customize layout" dialog.

It just seems counter-intuitive to have to go somewhere else.

(I am not saying that the property-sheet should not display the layoutManager
property - just that when I right click "customize layout" and I can't change
the layout, at first I was very confused.)
Sorry... I misunderstood the problem. I thought you were talking about changing
the properties of a specific layout. 
And yes... you are correct in that it is very inconvenient to have to change the
layout in the property sheet and then go to the Customize Layout window to work
with it more.

In VE 1.2, we have made changes to improve this:
There are separate VE preferences pages for both Swing and SWT that allows you
to select the default layout manager you would like to use when you drop a
container (e.g. JPanel). So instead of using the default FlowLayout (default
layout manager for JPanel), you can select GridBagLayout as your default.
Also, to make it easier to change the layout once you've dropped it the
container, a drop down menu was added next to the toolbar action on the main
Eclipse toolbar for 'Customize Layout'. This drop down meny works the same as
the property sheet drop down menu for the 'layout' property.

What I believe you are suggesting here is to add the capability to change the
layout from the Customize Layout window itself. This is a good suggestion and
we'll look at it for an enhancement in 1.2.
One additional capability I failed to mention is a 'Set Layout' cascading menu
tha was added to the context menu of the container... allowing you another way
to change the layout manager without having to go to the property sheet view.
All these changes were recently added and should be available in the next 1.2 build.
Peter,
In the current HEAD the "Set layout&gt;" is not on the Container/Composite sub 
menu any more.  There is a drop down list beside the button that launches the 
customize dialog, and this shows the availabe layout/layout managers together 
with an option to open the preferences page and change the default.
Can't remember the exact reason why the "set layout" pop-up was taken off, but 
it could easily be added back on if we want to.

Released in HEAD for 3.2 stream.

For eclipse 3.1, the work-around is simply to use the +/- to expand/collapse 
the tree, instead of double-clicking on a category.

Steve to decide whether or not this (simple) fix should be back-ported to 
eclipse 3.1, seeing as how the examples are fairly visible.
Marking for 3.2 M3 for now, anyway.
To be clear, it's a bug in the example, right?
Yes.
Ok, put it in the 3.1.x stream.
Done (there's no 3.1.2 target milestone yet in bugzilla, hope I remember to mark
this as such when there is).

(attributes/methods) when the current context frame corresponds to a method
defined in the same class.

In other words, the following classes:

class A {
  private int counter;
  public void inc() {
    counter++;  // &lt;&lt; breakpoint goes here
  }
}

class B extends A {

}

// main class
public class C {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    B b = new B();
    b.inc();
  }
}

One can type "this.counter" (or only counter) and evaluation works fine, but
auto-completion (for instance, type "this." + Ctrl-Space) does not show the
attribute.
Yes, this is a known limitation currently. Not sure if we can work around this 
as the completions are generated from the Java model's IType. It likely uses 
the "usual" visibility rules.
You can see the completions by unchecking the "Java &gt; Editor &gt; Content Assist" 
preference to "Hide proposals not visible in the current invocation context" 
to off. However, this is a global setting. Ideally the debugger would be able 
to override this when invoking content assist.

As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

    <WithStack>On Solaris, 6 of the ImportExistingTests fail with FormLayout tring to cast
GridData to FormData.

We add a composite to a shell in ImportExistingTest#getNewWizard():

wpip.createControl(shell);

but WizardProjectsImportPage#createControl(...) expects it's parent to be a
GridLayout, and our shell is a FormLayout.

It's wrong on all the platforms, but it only shows up on Solaris because it gets
some extra layout() events from the OS.

    <WithStack>In the RAC callback interface RemoteClientListener, two methods are defined:
clientAtive() and clientInactive().  The latter is called when an agent is
detached in the UI, giving the impression that the former will be called when a
UI attaches to the agent.

The clientActive() method is never called, which prevents its user from
detecting the correct state of UI.  This is particularly an issue if the agent
is trying to perform different actions based on whether the agent is being
attached to or not.  One example of the breakage caused by this is dynamic
discovery, in which a new agent will be dynamically discovered if it is not
attached to.

To the best of my knowledge, there is no workaround for this problem.

Our project will need this fixed in TPTP 4.2.
Samson confirms that this is not a regression (it has, unfortunately, always 
behaved this way). Based on that and on the fact that Qiyan's project is 
picking up 4.2 rather than 4.1, this is being retargeted to 4.2 as per his 
comment.
Qiyan, would you please give us a clearer use-case scenario for this new feature you are asking.  I know it has something to do with dynamic discovery, but a more detailed use-case would help avoid misunderstanding the scenario.  Thanks.
There are call backs methods an agent can implement so that it will be informed of certain events.  For instance, when a user starts monitoring an agent, monitorActive() from MonitorListener class is called.  Similarly, when a client is attached/detached, clientActive() and clientInactive() from RemoteClientListener should be called.  However, the clientActive() method is never called when a client is attached to.  Without this event, an agent cannot always determine its state correctly.

This interface has been in TPTP for a long time.  So this is not a new feature.
Reducing severity to major for the following reasons:
- There is a work around.  The agent can send a CustomCommand at initialization step to indicate that it is ready to do business
- This function has never been implemented and the above workaround is typically implemented by our customers.

Copying to Kevin so that he is aware of this issue
One scenario where this is a problem is when dynamic discovery is involved.

Suppose that agents A and B are both involved in a distributed transcaction and that the user manually attach both agents from the workbench.  Then the user would start monitoring A but not B.  If the transcaction starts from A and then goes to B, dynamic discovery will tell the workbench to attach to B.  Since agentActive() is not called when the user manually attaches to B, B believes it is in the detached state, causing the dynamic discovery mechanism to be invoked for each distributed transcaction.  From the user's point of view, this means the transcaction will be slowed down significantly for no particular reason.

Qiyan, I thought it is the clientActive() callback is not called, not agentActive().
Transfering to 4.3 per conversation with Qiyan.
My bad.  It was supposed to be clientActive() not agentActive().
Not containable in 4.3 and retarget to 4.4. Please let me know if you have any concern.

Retarget to future due to resource limitation.
Hi Bing. I have transferred my bugs to you for triage. Thanks.
As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. Since this defect is more than 2 years old, it may be no longer relevant. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this defect is resolved as WONTFIX.

Phil, I assigned these to you since you have knowledge on TemporaryAnnotations

annotations and structured marker annotations are only needed for breakpoints

    <WithStack>I get the following NPE after doing these steps:

- open the Java perspective
- make a view a fastview
- start dragging it, try to drop it on the bottom of the window so it takes the
full width of the window.
- NPE

Looks related to the changes for standalone views, this part may not have a
stack.  We should check all other callers of this once we find the NPE.

This needs to be fixed for 3.1.1.  It causes Linux to leave the mouse cursor as
a drag cursor and the drag does not end.  Requires killing the X Server.
Released for 3.1.1 &gt;20050927.

*** Bug 111682 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I am getting a NPE in a similar case which seems to be introduced in 3.6M4 (3.5 works fine).

I debugged a little bit and this could be a hint:

In org.eclipse.ui.internal.FastViewPane.hideView():
[...]

        // Hide it completely.
        getPresentation().setVisible(false);
        site.dispose();
        //currentPane.setFastViewSash(null);
        ctrl.setEnabled(false); // Remove focus support.

        currentPane.dispose();
        currentPane = null;

The call to getPresentation().setVisible(false) causes hideView to be called twice. The first time, everything goes fine, but the second time, currentPane is null and currentPane.dispose() will raise a NPE.
This is the stack trace:

Created attachment 157881
fast view bug project

I have just run the mail demo and made the message view available as a fast view in the fast view bar: it cannot be moved due to this NPE.

Just import the the project and run the INCLUDED launch as this will use the workbench ide.
Just downloaded 3.6M5 and imported the attached project and run the included launch config: bug persists.
Paul, since the stack trace is different, I guess maybe we should open a new bug instead of reopening this one?
(In reply to comment #12)
&gt; Paul, since the stack trace is different, I guess maybe we should open a new
&gt; bug instead of reopening this one?

Yes, there have been changes in this code, please open a new bug.

PW
I can also reproduce this bug in the final release of 3.6. Just try to drug a visible fast view. Is there a new bug for this? I couldn't find.
Check if (and make sure that) the view's setFocus method sets the focus to a control that is in your view... at least, leaving setFocus empty will lead to this bug in 3.6...
+1 for reopen.

Tested in Eclipse 3.6.1.
When setFocus() view's method is empty and after doing these steps:

1. Open Show View Dialog.
2. Open a View with a setFocus() method that is empty.
3. Try to drag it and it will "disappear".because of the NPE.

The stack trace is:

&gt; Tested in Eclipse 3.6.1.
&gt; When setFocus() view's method is empty and after doing these steps:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Open Show View Dialog.
&gt; 2. Open a View with a setFocus() method that is empty.

Clients are expected to assign focus to one of its controls. Leaving this blank is going against the API.

This makes sense! Thank you for the information!</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I get the following NPE after doing these steps:

- open the Java perspective
- make a view a fastview
- start dragging it, try to drop it on the bottom of the window so it takes the
full width of the window.
- NPE

Looks related to the changes for standalone views, this part may not have a
stack.  We should check all other callers of this once we find the NPE.

I added 2 calls to PartPane#getStack() and didn't check for null.

This needs to be fixed for 3.1.1.  It causes Linux to leave the mouse cursor as
a drag cursor and the drag does not end.  Requires killing the X Server.

I am getting a NPE in a similar case which seems to be introduced in 3.6M4 (3.5 works fine).

I debugged a little bit and this could be a hint:

In org.eclipse.ui.internal.FastViewPane.hideView():
[...]

        // Hide it completely.
        getPresentation().setVisible(false);
        site.dispose();
        //currentPane.setFastViewSash(null);
        ctrl.setEnabled(false); // Remove focus support.

        currentPane.dispose();
        currentPane = null;

The call to getPresentation().setVisible(false) causes hideView to be called twice. The first time, everything goes fine, but the second time, currentPane is null and currentPane.dispose() will raise a NPE.
This is the stack trace:

Created attachment 157881
fast view bug project

I have just run the mail demo and made the message view available as a fast view in the fast view bar: it cannot be moved due to this NPE.

Just import the the project and run the INCLUDED launch as this will use the workbench ide.
Just downloaded 3.6M5 and imported the attached project and run the included launch config: bug persists.
Paul, since the stack trace is different, I guess maybe we should open a new bug instead of reopening this one?

Yes, there have been changes in this code, please open a new bug.

PW
I can also reproduce this bug in the final release of 3.6. Just try to drug a visible fast view. Is there a new bug for this? I couldn't find.
Check if (and make sure that) the view's setFocus method sets the focus to a control that is in your view... at least, leaving setFocus empty will lead to this bug in 3.6...
+1 for reopen.

Tested in Eclipse 3.6.1.
When setFocus() view's method is empty and after doing these steps:

1. Open Show View Dialog.
2. Open a View with a setFocus() method that is empty.
3. Try to drag it and it will "disappear".because of the NPE.

The stack trace is:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 0 2011-01-10 15:39:59.769

This also used to work as you typed the atributes or content assisted them.
This feature (bolding) seems to be broken now.
What's "bolding" for?  Just readability?

So you can easily tell which attributes are already present in the tag, and
which ones are available to be added still.

The IContextInformationPresenter wasn't being used and when it was, the wrong contextinformation object was being passed in (a wrapped compoundcontextinformation instead of the real contextinformation).  See bug 124983.

While investigating this bug, I also noticed java parameter help no longer worked (see bug 111876 for an example of how it did work).  This was because getContextInformationPosition() in our CustomCompletionProposals was returning the wrong position.  So that's fixed too with this bug.

    <WithStack>WSDL editor content assist not working if WSDL schemas are not explicitly added 
to the XML catalog. If the WSDL schemas are not present, they should be cached 
by the internet cache, and the editor can use the cached copy to provide 
content assist.
When resolving URI editor content model does not call 
URIResolver.resolvePhysicalLocation, which actually is responsible for 
accessing the cache.  

I'm attaching a patch for XMLModelQueryAssociationProvider. The fix is in 
resolveGrammarURI method. I'd like Craig and Lawrence to review it.  
Created attachment 27416
patch for XMLModelQueryAssociationProvider
Lawrence, can you review Ella's patch? Thanks.
The patch looks OK but is there a reason that the resolve method must be called
before the resolvePhysical method? The resolvePhysical method is meant for when
you want to get an actual location as the result of resolution (which, as I
understand it, is what the editor needs to do in this case). Is the catalog not
included in the resolvePhysical method call? If not, this patch looks good for
now and we should correct the registration of the catalog with the framework in M9.
Yes, XMLCatalogURIResolverExtension was contributed to "postnormalization" 
stage, but not to "physical" stage.  We have to reconcile that.  
Thanks Ella and Lawrence. The patch seems safe enough. I've done some testing 
with the 0923 driver + patch, content assist now works. David, fix approved for 
0.7.1?
Yes, approved. But, please note in the patched code itself, and open 
a new bug to track Ella's comment about 
"XMLCatalogURIResolverExtension was contributed to "postnormalization" 
stage, but not to "physical" stage.  We have to reconcile that.". 

Hopefully having that open will help us reconcile the reconciler :) 
and, helpfully, remember places in the code ot fix once its done. 

Thanks. 
Fix commited and released.

What connection method are you using?
I am using "extssh" on the default port.

Btw this is SourceForge CVS which is known to sometime give timeouts after a

Hi Irum,

Hmm, currently it's not that easy - you'd have to go from the source
code of the element, to get the string, then extract the names of any
pointcuts, and then locate those pointcuts. We're working on some
pointcut utilities, and we should probably add an easy way to get the
string from the advice element. But I think there's an even better
way, which is for us to expose the "uses pointcut" relationship that
is down in ajde - then you could go straight from an AdviceElement to
a list of PointcutElements. Please raise an enhancement request, and
we'll look into it.

Regards,

Matt.

Fixed. The AJDT model now contains "uses pointcut" and "pointcut used by"
relationships. These can be shown in the Cross References and Crosscutting
Comparison views, although they are filtered out by default - you can adjust the
filters to see them. The relationships can of course also be queried
programmatically just like the "advises" etc relationships - for an example see
testUsesPointcutRels() in AJModelTest2.java in the org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests
project.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I am trying to create a plugin to display information regarding matches 
of "DeclareElements" and "AdviceElements". I am using the APIs 
AJModel.getInstance().getRelatedElements(). When the matched element is 
a "method call" somewhere, the matched element is a "AJCodeElement" and I am 
able to get all the information such as Line numbers etc. from it. However, 
when the matched element is a "SourceMethod" as in the case of a method 
execution pointcut, the line number is not available. 

If the line number was available from the "SourceMethod" it would be really 
helpful for my plugin UI display. Changes to it will be very useful.
Irum,
I don't think we can help with this one, as SourceMethod is a JDT type, outside
of our control. You could make a request to the JDT team to add line number
information, but I don't believe they would consider it appropriate because
Eclipse types generally work with offsets into the buffer instead of line
numbers. So you could at least call getSourceRange() on the SourceMethod, and
then get the length and offset from that. You can translate an offset into a
line number by scanning through the contents of the buffer, but of course that
might not be too efficient, unless the buffer has already been loaded.</WithStack>

&gt; you can already do that on the Java -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Type Filter page
&gt; 

Yes, you can already do that _but_ you have to know that the Type Filter page exists and where it is or that typing 'Filter' in the Preferences search tool will find the page AND you need to know that the Type Filter page is where this filtering is configured.  There is _nothing_ in the Content Assist page that indicates the possibility of filtering.  The only way to find out is to look at the help (and search for "Content Assist" - not just navigate to the "Content Assist" section).

This proposed enhancement is about making it easier to configure "Content Assist".

An alternative is to add the "Type Filter" page when "Content Assist" is typed into the Preferences search tool.

Please consider reopening this entry.
I rename the request to improve the preference page.
One possibility is to add a link from the code assist preference page to type filters.
Added a link and a preference page keyword to find the Type Filter page when entering "content assist".

Error 3

The build this error occurred in was TPTP-4.1.0-200509221114
This needs to get fixed obviously.
Initially, this appears to be a zOS build problem rather than a code problem. 
The compiler on zOS is choking on a new variable of type "bool" which was 
introduced into a c++ part by bugzilla 105189. The compiler is complaining 
that "bool" is not a type although it clearly is (zOS C/C++ language reference 
specifically documents "bool" as a type but only for C++ compilations). The 
code fragment containing the problem is *not* platform specific and the other 
platforms' C++ compilers are *not* complaining. 

The zOS build compiles C++ parts with cxx (rather than c89 for C parts). I am 
checking the cxx compiler invocation to see if we have the right incantation.
One suspect is the compile option "TARGET\(OSV2R10\)". I believe that option 
was needed for link/runtime compatability at same point in the (distant?) 
past.  Unfortunately, if it had any bearing on the language definition itself, 
that would be bad for "bool" because the "bool" type was explicitly excluded 
from the language as implemented for the V2R10 version of the C/C++ compiler on 
zOS (see section 1.2.2.5 of the OS/390 V2R10.0 C/C++ Language Reference). 

The TARGET option has been part of the cxx/c89 incantation in the build since 
time immemorial and may not be easy to eliminate at this time. One alternative 
would be to try to explicitly enable the bool type by using KEYWORD options: 
KEYWORD(bool) KEYWORD(true) KEYWORD(false) at least for the C++ parts.

Next step: some trials with the build folks to confirm or deny this as the 
culprit.
The use of the V2R10 compiler is indeed the root of the problem. It is being 
used explicitly via STEPLIB in the setup script. (Note: the TARGET option sets 
up the compile for the corresponding V2R10 link/runtime environment but does 
not itself control the version of the compiler being used).

Unfortunately, while shooting this problem, we have uncovered a separate build 
problem that is impeding the fix/verification of the original problem. Defect 
110882 has been opened to track that bug.  
We have gotten past the nested build problem (110882). Trials have now shown 
that we can't bypass the original problem by use of the KEYWORD option (that 
option is unsupported on the down-level compiler). We are left with having to 
kludge the solution by typedef'ing the "bool" type in source for zOS only.
The necesary "bool" typedef was added to the StatelessHeapSnapshotManager.h 
header 10/03/2005 3:30pm.

The as400 build was also broken at the same time as this zOS break by the same 
105189 bugzilla but in a slightly different way (related to exports and a 
modified constructor signature). That problem was later opened as 111359 but 
the fix for it was mistakenly checked in under this bugzilla (10/03/2005 
1:29pm). 111359 has been marked dependent on this defect for that reason.

*holds out hands* Will elaborate for aliases.   :)
Hey I already gave you one alias and you gave me nothing ... you owe it to me to
elaborate.

D.
Well here's the deal.  I'm highly allergic to guinea pigs.  In fact, just last week I was nearly sent to the 
hospital because of a random encounter with one of the little blighters.  The situation was very messed up 
and not only included the pig but also a rancid butter tar, a can of WD-40, and a batch of unprocessed 
iron ore.

Anyhoo... so the pig and I are having issues.  So much so, that if I even spell the word right I'll break out in 
hives and my lungs will invert themselves.

You don't want me to have inverted lungs do you?
What kind of fascist guinae pig are you!?!?!??  You won't give Kim the  
"sexyeclipsegrrl17" alias?  Shame on you. 
 
 
;) 
 
  
Actually, I simply thought that the "eclipse" portion of sexyeclipsegrrl17 was
redundant. Had she requested sexygrrl17@eclipse.org that would have been fine.

But instead, call me a fascist pig. Fine. Don't come to me for help with your
"lost cvs password"  =)

    <WithStack>If a developer has a source file open that is generated by an annotation 
processor and then changes the processor/factory that generated that file to a 
different annotation factory implementation (i.e. different jar file == 
different generated source file) the changes are not reflected in the open 
source file until it is closed and re-opened in the editor. The project is 
being rebuilt correctly but this is confusing to developers as they can't see 
the changes being made if they already have the generated source open.  
Clicking refresh in the ‘Package Explorer’ view does not refresh the file in 
the editor.

Setup steps: Create simple project with simple a class that uses an annotation 
like @HelloWorld. Create two seperate @HelloWorld processors, one in external 
Jar A.jar and the other in B.jar, make sure they generate slightly different 
source at compile time but with the same class and package, one can 
print 'Hello world A.jar' the other 'Hello World B.jar'. Add them to classpath 
and to the Annotation Factory Path (Right click on project/Properties/Java 
Compiler/Annotation Processing/Factory Path/Add External Jars). Add them so 
A.jar is highier on the list than B.jar so A.jar will be used at compile time. 

Repro Steps: Once you have set up your simple project and can see the source 
file generated by the @HelloWorld annotation processor found in A.jar, open 
the generated source file in the IDE. Now go into project properties and 
change the Factory path so that B.jar is higher in the Factory path and apply 
the changes. This means the project will be re-built with the processor found 
in B.jar but the generated source displayed in the open file in the editor is 
still showing the old source generated by A.jar. Clicking refresh on the 
Package Explorer view does not fix the problem. You have to close the file and 
reopen it to see the newly generated file by B.jar processor. 

Note: When you edit a source file outside of the IDE there is a prompt 
advising that ‘the file has changed on the file system. Do you want to load 
the changes?’
Adrian, could you attach A.jar and B.jar to this bug if you have them handy?
Created attachment 28365
A.jar

This is a simple hello world Annotation factory and processor used to replicate
this bug, it generates a file that contain s the phrase "A.jar". The annotation
is @HelloWorldAnnotation
Created attachment 28366
B.jar

Same as A.jar except generates method helloWorldB() and the prints the string
"Hello, (B) world!  This file produced by B.Jar"

print 'Hello world A.jar' the other 'Hello World B.jar'. Add them to classpath 
and to the Annotation Factory Path (Right click on project/Properties/Java 
Compiler/Annotation Processing/Factory Path/Add External Jars). Add them so 
A.jar is highier on the list than B.jar so A.jar will be used at compile time. 

Repro Steps: Once you have set up your simple project and can see the source 
file generated by the @HelloWorld annotation processor found in A.jar, open 
the generated source file in the IDE. Now go into project properties and 
change the Factory path so that B.jar is higher in the Factory path and apply 
the changes. This means the project will be re-built with the processor found 
in B.jar but the generated source displayed in the open file in the editor is 
still showing the old source generated by A.jar. Clicking refresh on the 
Package Explorer view does not fix the problem. You have to close the file and 
reopen it to see the newly generated file by B.jar processor. 

Note: When you edit a source file outside of the IDE there is a prompt 
advising that ‘the file has changed on the file system. Do you want to load 
the changes?’
Adrian, could you attach A.jar and B.jar to this bug if you have them handy?
Created attachment 28365
A.jar

This is a simple hello world Annotation factory and processor used to replicate
this bug, it generates a file that contain s the phrase "A.jar". The annotation
is @HelloWorldAnnotation
Created attachment 28366
B.jar

Same as A.jar except generates method helloWorldB() and the prints the string
"Hello, (B) world!  This file produced by B.Jar"

    <WithStack>For any test suites that must be run on several platforms, create a test suite
for each platform. Duplicate references to test cases instead of duplicating
test cases. 

Each test suite should be named, for example, Platform.Communications_zSeries or
Platform.Communications_windows.
Done
I missed one platform, and I see that the names that I chose don't match the
names that the build uses. I'll rename that now.

    <WithOutStack>For any test suites that must be run on several platforms, create a test suite
for each platform. Duplicate references to test cases instead of duplicating
test cases. 

Each test suite should be named, for example, Platform.Communications_zSeries or
Platform.Communications_windows.
Done
I missed one platform, and I see that the names that I chose don't match the
names that the build uses. I'll rename that now.

Fix released to HEAD
Bogdan, please verify during 3.2 M3 test pass
Verified in I20051101-0010
We were resolving bugs in our bug system and I thought this bug was fixed because I could no longer reproduce it.  However, one of our other developers could reliably reproduce it.  After some further head bashing we found out that this bug still exists iff you have an editor open when you exit Eclipse.  So - to reproduce:

1) Open Eclipse with at least one *non-CVS* project in your workspace.
2) Close all editors.
3) Open any file so you have one editor open.
4) Select any "file" in any *non-CVS* project in the navigator view.
5) Close the workbench.
6) Restart Eclipse.
7) Without touching *anything*, goto Project &gt; Share Project...

The file will be selected, and the menu item will be enabled and you will get a very weird exception dialog.

I'm able to reproduce this one. Here is the stack trace:

As you can see the NPE is caused because there is actually no Project selected. I can see at least two solutions for the problem:
1. Make sure that "Share Project" entry in the main menu is disabled for all non-project resources (the entry in the popup menu is disabled like it should be).
2. Modify the TeamAction#getSelectedProjects() method so it will return a project even when there is a file/folder selected. We can look for the project of a given resource.
The question is why is the menu enabled in the first place. The ConfigureProjectAction#isEnabled() method clearly only returns true if a single project is selected. It appears that, on startup, there is a scenario where the isEnabled is not being called before the operation is run. This may be a bug in the workbench so we should track it down (i.e. try and debug it and confirm that isEnabled is not being called and, if confirmed, forward the bug to Platform/UI).

Having said that, we should also add a check to the execute to exit if there isn't a selected project.
Yes.  I have had similar issues in the past with some of my actions being enabled when they were clearly not *supposed* to be and I never did track them down.  It was driving me nuts.  Eventually I just decided it was a feature. ;)  Although I never made the connection to an editor being open...

Fix

The check for proper selection added to the execute method. After some debugging done I can confirm that the isEnabled test is not called for the Project &gt; Share Project... as well as for other Team Actions located in the main toolbar menu.

First, I though about disabling the menu entry (the action) after the check in the execute method fails. But I think that after forwarding the bug to Platform/UI they will find a better way to handle this case.
I have released the patch to HEAD. Now that we've fixed the problem in Team, it would be good if we could create a simple example plug-in that shows the failure. We can then create a separate bug against Platform/UI and attach the example. Tomek, can you do this please.
Done. The bug with a simple plug-in is here: bug 195879.
Thanks. Marking the Team specific issue fixed.

This problem seemed to appear when using the css.core plugin jar instead of non-jar form (so problem didn't show up when debugging, but showed up at standalone runtime)  It looks like there's difficulty finding the cssprofile.properies file.

plugin affected
-org.eclipse.wst.css.core

files modified
-RegistryReader
-CSSProfileImpl

RegistryReader#readElement
change:
String pluginId = element.getDeclaringExtension().getNamespace();
to:
String pluginId = element.getContributor().getName();
change:
URL url = Platform.find(bundle, path);
to:
URL url = FileLocator.find(bundle, path, null);
change:
url = Platform.asLocalURL(url);
info = new CSSProfileImpl(strID, url);
to:
url = FileLocator.toFileURL(url);
info = new CSSProfileImpl(strID, url, strURI);

Passed in original strURI so that CSSProfileImpl can work with it as well as the "localized" URL.  Other changes were to fix up some deprecation calls.

CSSProfileImpl
-added new package protected CSSProfileImpl constructor which takes in additional strURI paramenter
-modified getResourceBundle so that instead of trying to build its own ClassLoader based on incorrectly guessing cssprofile's location (incorrectly because it was not handling jar'd plugins correctly) use platform's FileLocator.openStream() to have platform automatically figure out the appropriate classloader to use.  getResourceBundle does have to figure out the potential cssprofile file names though, using Java ResourceBundle naming convention.  This is because FileLocator.openStream does not correctly do this for us (despite what its javadoc says)  See bug 103345 for some history on that.
Thanks for digging into this Amy.

Modified logic model to show bug

This is a modified logic model which shows the bug. The diagram consists of a
single AND gate.

Modification:
Removed diagram element and corresponding semantic element. This causes the AND
gate semantic element to become a root element.
Sounds like the diagram infrastructure's common Delete command assumes that a
Resource has a single root element, so that it should not be deletable?
Changing component to "Runtime Diagram"
This seems to work fine now.

Changes committed but not released yet.
I'm just being obsessive about open bugs with a version of 0.7.1 ... we have no
strict rules about that field, but I wanted my query to have zero. 
I assume this is targeted for M9? 

Released as v20050927_1715.  Please resolve defect.

Peter, please also update target milestone to M9.

Changes committed but not released yet.
I'm just being obsessive about open bugs with a version of 0.7.1 ... we have no
strict rules about that field, but I wanted my query to have zero. 
I assume this is targeted for M9? 

Released as v20050927_1715.  Please resolve defect.

Peter, please also update target milestone to M9.
Fixed
This defect has been fixed.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Using 0.7M20050915 build if ANY projects in a workspace are closed then the Java
Jar Dependencies preference page will not list any workspace projects (empty
table). Moreover, WTP builds are incorrect (at least for new web apps) as all
dependent projects are not included in the new web app build(all dependent
project jars are missing). The previous dependency information, if any, is still
retained in .wtpmodules. If the closed projects are opened then Java Jar
Dependency pages is correct the builds proceed properly. Any closed project will
cause this, even if the project is not a dependency.

It was very hard to find the scenario that causes this to happen  and can cause
great frustration to those who encounter it, which is why the severity was
entered as critical.

This may be a separate bug but sometimes builds need to be motivated to work
correctly by deselecting a dependent project (and hit apply) then reselect the
dependent project and hit APPLY from the Java Jar Dependencies page.
Fixed, code in CVS
This bug is being moved to the "closed" state since because it has been in the fixed state for a long time it is being assumed fixed without explicit verification from the originator. If there is still a problem, in the most recent 1.5.x builds, please reopen or open another bug.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hello,

When opening an EditorPart the isDirty method is called 5 times.  I am using
3.2M1.  Thanks for a great tool!
Actually, it's normal because of the listener pattern based architecture.

With the Text editor opening a text file, we get calls to IEditorPart#isDirty() from

3 action constructors
4  from getPart(true)  (listeners)
Presentation call
6 from action udpate states (listeners)
1 from a TextListener

This might be cause for updating some of the java docs.

PW

Do you mean to update the javadoc to warn that isDirty will be called many 
times? 
 
That's what I was thinking ... or just close the bug with a little note
explaining what's going on.

PW

I added a small note to the isDirty() interface, since the behaviour is correct.

    <WithStack>The job will be selected if click on job (not on checkbox).  The highlight is
removed on the selected job and the checkbox is used to present whether the job
is selected ot not.  Actually there is a problem to hightlight the selected job
and unhightlight the unselected job.  Then I removed all hightlight on selection.
Please remove checkbox altogether. It makes the interface too confusing. Use the same technique to 
unselect all jobs that is used in the package explorer when you click on the empty part of the view - i.e. it 
unselects all folders.

I will do again.  By the way, I cannot undeslect all folders in the package
explorer if click on the empty part of the view.  I think there is a difference
between windows and mac.

I suggest using the 'click in empty part of window to clear selection' for Mac/Linux and 'click on selected 
item to clear selection' for Windows.
I have removed the checkbox in job view.  If the mouse is clicked on empty part
of view, it will deselect all jobs.  Please check it.  Also I added a popup menu
for removing the finished job from the view.  You can right click on the job and
then the popup menu will be displayed.  If the job is still running, the menu
will be disabled.  Until the job is finished or terminated, the menu item will
be enabled when you right click on the job.  After you clicked the menu item,
the selected job will be removed from the job view and then refresh the view. 
See if it is okay.

Selection seems to work fine (at least on a Mac - I haven't tested on other platforms).

For the remove jobs pop, I would suggest just a single menu item for "Remove All Terminated" that pops 
up anywhere (on a job or on the empty view). This is the same as in the debug view.
I have changed what you want.  User can select the job to remove it in the
previous design, now I changed to remove all stopped jobs in job view.

    <WithStack>I believe latest is r311_vM20050914-1235

This suffices for our 0.7.1 build, and current 1.0 stream builds, but 
when we start 1.5 stream, we should have seperate base builder for it
(based on 3.2 stream JDT compiler) 

and maintenance releases of 0.7.1 or 1.0 continue to use 3.1.1 based 
base-builder.
Also, which build.properties can we update to get version printed in compile log? 

# This parameter is specific to the compiler
# being used (JDT Compiler, in our case).
# 'showversion' causes the version of JDT Compiler to be 
# printed to the compiler log file. 
compilerArg=-showversion
I did update base builder, to r311_vM20050914-1235
Confirmed in an "S" build, that JDT compiler went from 
Eclipse Java Compiler 0.567, pre-3.1.0 release candidate-3
to 
Eclipse Java Compiler 0.570, 3.1.0 release

Have not re-run 0.7.1 M build yet. 
Hopefully someone knows a property file to update? 
If not, we'll simply re-run, and mark this bug as fixed. 

I did setup a task in the build target to export a tagged version of the
basebuilder with each build from CVS.  I will add the tag to the build.cfg so
that we can use different basdebuilders with different types of builds.


I'm not sure I understand comment #3. 
The base builder I'm talking about is what is in 
org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder

I've seen 
eclipseBuildURL
added to build.cfg, and not sure how its used, but it points to
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/M20050923-1430/

I'm not sure if I'm missing the obvious, or just need it spelled out for me. 

I assume it is still org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder that does our build? 
(that is, its version of PDE build, and JDT compiler are used). 
I realize there's another "classpath" that determines the java libraries used, 
but that's different than this bugzilla. 

And, BTW, org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder has been updated on build machine, 
as per pervious comemnts, but ...

Given above, I'd like to remove confusion by getting 
compilerArg=-showversion
in the right build.properties that puts JDT compiler version in the 
compiler output. Which build.properties is it? 

I think the adding the following properties will do it (look for the 
compilerArg property).

For 0.7.1, in releng.builder\scripts\build.xml, add the line in red:

&lt;ant antfile="build.xml" dir="${pde.build.scripts}" &gt;
  &lt;property name="builder" value="${basedir}/../components/${component}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="relengDir" value="${basedir}/.." /&gt;
  &lt;property name="compilerArg" value="-showversion"/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;

For 1.0, in releng.wtpbuilder\scripts\build\build.xml, add the line in red:

&lt;ant antfile="build.xml" dir="${pde.build.scripts}"&gt;
  &lt;property name="builder" value="${wtp.builder.home}/components/
${component}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="wtp.builder.home" value="${wtp.builder.home}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="buildBranch" value="${buildBranch}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="cvsUser" value="${cvsUser}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="cvsProtocol" value="${cvsProtocol}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="dependencyTargets" 
value="${wtp.builder.home}/scripts/dependency/build.xml" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="local.cache.dir" value="${build.home}/
${build.local.repository}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="baseLocation" value="${build.home}/${build.current}-
${build.distribution}-${buildType}/${base.location}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="buildRoot" value="${build.home}/${build.current}-
${build.distribution}-${buildType}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="testRoot" value="${build.home}/${build.tests}-
${build.distribution}-${buildType}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="performanceRoot" value="${build.home}/${build.perf.tests}-
${buildType}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="bootclasspath" value="${java.home}/lib/rt.jar${path.separator}
${java.home}/lib/jsse.jar" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="compilerArg" value="-showversion"/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
Ok, I've updated R0_7_maintenance to try Jeffrey's suggestion. 
Versioned it with v20050927_0015

We are already getting the correct versions printed out in 1.0 stream, 
due to property in build.property file. (For some reason, that doesn't work 
in 0.7 stream). 

I've confirmed Jeffrey's suggesiton in comment #5 fixes the issue for getting 
compiler version printed in log, and, its the right one! :) 
Eclipse Java Compiler 0.570, 3.1.0 release


Hence, marking as "fixed". (I still think we may eventually need improvements in 
how and where tagged versionof base builder is downloaded, but first I'll
understand what it currently does :)  
I can see the directory's date/time is updated, so, must be working .. but its 
not obvious to me how to tell which one is being used. I'm sure its buried in
those scripts somewhere :) 
[relatively minor concern is that even for developers local builds builds, may
have to re-download the base builder each time?]

Confirming fixed. 
This is part of a mass update to close out all stale WTP defects already verified by the reporter but awaiting closure by the assignee.  If you feel this defect was closed inappropriately, please reopen.

Ok, I've updated R0_7_maintenance to try Jeffrey's suggestion. 
Versioned it with v20050927_0015

We are already getting the correct versions printed out in 1.0 stream, 
due to property in build.property file. (For some reason, that doesn't work 
in 0.7 stream). 

I've confirmed Jeffrey's suggesiton in comment #5 fixes the issue for getting 
compiler version printed in log, and, its the right one! :) 
Eclipse Java Compiler 0.570, 3.1.0 release


Hence, marking as "fixed". (I still think we may eventually need improvements in 
how and where tagged versionof base builder is downloaded, but first I'll
understand what it currently does :)  
I can see the directory's date/time is updated, so, must be working .. but its 
not obvious to me how to tell which one is being used. I'm sure its buried in
those scripts somewhere :) 
[relatively minor concern is that even for developers local builds builds, may
have to re-download the base builder each time?]

Confirming fixed. 
This is part of a mass update to close out all stale WTP defects already verified by the reporter but awaiting closure by the assignee.  If you feel this defect was closed inappropriately, please reopen.

    <WithStack>I'm trying to upgrade from AspectJ1.2.1 to AspectJ1.5.
I'm trying to aspectize a jar and make a new jar. But this is working fine in 
AspectJ1.2.1 even now. But this problem occurs in aspectJ1.5. Is thr any 
workaround for this

Hmmm, is struts.jar definetly a valid jar file?  you can unzip/unjar it OK
outside of AspectJ?  Is this only happening on solaris like the other bug, or is
it also happening on windows?

All the code that is failing is basically doing is:

zipFile = new ZipFile(new File("struts.jar"))  

Aspectj hasn't even had a chance to touch the contents of it by the time it goes
wrong.
No this is happening even in windows when i tried with AspectJ1.5. But itz 
working quite fine when i tried with Ver1.2.1. Is thr any work around for 
this.. I was stuck up in the middle as i'm unable to change completely to 
Ver1.5 because of this kind of error nor i cudn't proceed with 1.2.1 because 
of that internal compiler error
 
But have you tried opening the struts.jar outside of AspectJ, just on the
command line - is the jar OK??

It is possible that extra processing in AspectJ5 is requiring us to open that
jar where we didn't bother previously - under AspectJ1.2.1 we may never have
tried to open it.  

All I can suggest is moving struts.jar to the end of your classpath - AspectJ is
not necessarily looking for a class from that archive, it is just opening all
the jars on the classpath in turn trying to find something.
Yeah. I'm manually able to open tht jar. But this is not the case only with 
struts.jar. I'm getting this error for all the jars that i'm tryin to 
aspectize.. 

FWIW, I've verified that I can open (and weave) struts.jar on Windows with AJ 5. 
Is this still a problem for you?
Finally I recreated this today by accident.  It occurs if the output jar you are
writing to is on your classpath !!
or if a jar on the classpath is zero size - which happens if you have it as the
outjar - we open the file to write to then attempt to open it when resolving
something from the classpath, bang.
investigate if still a problem for 1.5.4
per my comments 7 and 8, I think this is addressed now in AspectJ1.6 as those situations are now checked.  please reopen if still an issue.</WithStack>

After the Error box is closed the eclipse logo form stays up. Needs closing

I checked out the -cp /usr/eclipse/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
and the pathes exist, I don't know if it means much but in
org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main the main is main.class and the metod is defalted,
as in the explorer methos column.

Thank you for your support.

I have started Eclipse with the -vm line as indicated "eclipse -vm
&lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;/jre/bin/java" (eclipse -vm /opt/jre/bin/java) and received this
error message:
JVM terminated. Exit code=1

-cp /usr/eclipse/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main 

After the Error box is closed the eclipse logo form stays up. Needs closing
manually.

I checked out the -cp /usr/eclipse/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
and the pathes exist, I don't know if it means much but in
org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main the main is main.class and the metod is defalted,
as in the explorer methos column.

Thank you for your support.

Error pop up while drag a 'HalfAdder' to canvas
It sounds like the Cairo library is not being found. Please add it to your 
ld_library_path.
And you'll need GDI+ on Windows 2000.
I reopen this bug because the same problem occurs after add Cairo library to 
ld_library_path. If the steps below are wrong, please change the status back.

I downloaded cairo-1.0.0.tar.gz from http://www.cairographics.org/releases/

On linux, I extracted the .gz file to a directory 'Cairo' and add it to the 
ld_library_path by the command 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Cairo/cairo-1.0.0'

The same problem still occurs in Eclipse.

Are the steps above correct? 
If the steps are incorrect, Could you please advise the detail configuration 
steps?  Thanks a lot.

The version of Cairo for 3.1 ships with 3.1. Perhaps the readme mentioned 
something about it. I've never used it myself.
You need Cairo 0.4 for Eclipse 3.1.1.  It ships with the Eclipse build, so I 
believe all you need to do is set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the base eclipse 
directory.
I still got the same problem, following are my configration steps:
1. Create a folder 'IES'
2. Extract Eclipse files into IES directory
3. set LD_LIBRARY_PATH by the command 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/IES/eclipse'
4. Re-run the scenario, the same problem occurs.

NOTE: At step 3, I also tried 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/IES', but it did't work.

If the steps above are wrong, could you please advise the detail steps?
Thanks a lot.

Please don't reopen the bug to ask a question. There is not a bug. Here is the 
message from the SWT team about using Cairo:
http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform.swt/msg22062.html
Tiffany, you're using Motif, right?

At step 3, you should be doing:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/IES/eclipse
Randy/Pratik,
We did add eclipse base directory to the library path. But the problem still 
exists. Besides, we encountered the same problem on RHEL 4 update2, windows 
2000 SP4 and SLES 9. Is there any possible that it is not a problem related to 
Cairo library? Thank You.
IF the problem only happens for half and full adder, it is because those parts 
have connections, and connection are rendered using anti-aliasing, and anti-
aliasing requires Cairo.

Try dropping two LEDs and connecting them. If it fails when you try to connect 
them, Cairo is still missing.
comment 0 mentions that when the parts are added to the canvas, an error 
message pops up saying "An error has occurred.  See error log for more 
details."  What is that error in the error log?

All the error logs displayed in Error Log View is attached in the file named 
geflog.zip. 
The problem still exists after export LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (export 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\IES\eclipse)

In the logs, we found the msg: 
'org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Unable to load graphics library [Cairo is 
required](java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /IES928/eclipse/configuration/
org.eclipse.osgi/bundles/9/1/.cp/libswt-cairo-gtk-3206.so 
(libcairo.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory))'

According to the logs, the problem may because it can't find 'libcairo.so.2'.
There is no such a file named "libcairo.so.2" in my test environment (RHEL 4 
update 2), there is only 'libcairo.so.1' under eclipse folder.

To fix this problem, we might need to have the proper file include in eclipse? 
Please provide your suggestion. Thank You!!
Hmm, looks like you're using GTK, not Motif.  I was under the impression that, 
for 3.1.1, you didn't have to do anything to make Cairo work on GTK.

CCing Billy from the SWT team for comment.
Actually ccing Billy this time.
OK there is some confusion in this bug.  The first problem, the crash, does not
seem to have to do with Cairo at all.  It is crashing because of a bad pointer
during a call to getMonitor() when opening a dialog.  Furthermore, while this
bug was reported against M20050915, the crash log is with SWT 3205, which
indicates a recent I-build and not 3.1.1.

Eclipse 3.2 requires cairo 1.0 (which has a binary named cairo.so.2 while old
versions are cairo.so.1).  We currently still ship a (now useless) cairo.so.1 in
the 3.2 stream, see bug 110924.  Note that cairo-1.0.0.tar.gz is the source
release and must be compiled before you can use it, see the INSTALL file in that
archive.
Reassigning to SWT to investigate the original crash.  Is this still reproducable?
Billy, if the reporter is [incorrectly] using a 3.2 version of Eclipse, then I 
am sure they do not have Cairo 1.0 installed. This is still user error.

Cam, this is not the first time testers have been using GEF with the wrong pre-
reqs. Please get this under control.
Tiffany - can you change the ld_library_path to use the correct version of the 
Cairo library that matches with 3.1.1 and try the steps again?  Based on 
Billy's comment #19 and the error message you received (see your comment #16) 
it sounds like the correct version is 'libcairo.so.1'.
BB, please unmuddle this.  If there is a crash in getMonitor(), open a bug 
report with the stack trace.  If the problem is the wrong Cairo library, link 
this bug to the one that is tracking this issue.
Tiffany Lu: I think you need to tell me what you want to be investigated here.

The original crash in this bug is with I20050913-0800 (3.2 before M2), is it
reproducable with M2 or newer?
For M20050929-0840 build, it needs libcairo.so.1.
After 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/IES/eclipse/', the problem doesn't exist.

For I20050923-1000 build, it needs libcairo.so.2.
we refer to comment #19, follow the INSTALL file to install Cairo 1.0 
under '/Cairo/cairo-1.0.0' folder, then libcairo.so.2 can be found 
under '/Cairo/cairo-1.0.0/src/.libs'.
After 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Cairo/cairo-1.0.0/src/.libs' then re-run the 
scenairo, the problem doesn't exist.

Since the problem does not exist on v3.1.1 and the problem on v3.2 is reported 
by bug 110942, we would like to close this bug. Please help to update the 
status and we may close it. Thanks.
Sorry! There is a typo in the previous comment, it should be 
"Since the problem does not exist on v3.1.1 and the problem on v3.2 is 
reported by bug 110924, we would like to close this bug. Please help to update 
the status and we may close it. Thanks."
Thanks, closing.
As Comment #26, close the bug.

am sure they do not have Cairo 1.0 installed. This is still user error.

Cam, this is not the first time testers have been using GEF with the wrong pre-
reqs. Please get this under control.
Tiffany - can you change the ld_library_path to use the correct version of the 
Cairo library that matches with 3.1.1 and try the steps again?  Based on 
Billy's comment #19 and the error message you received (see your comment #16) 
it sounds like the correct version is 'libcairo.so.1'.
BB, please unmuddle this.  If there is a crash in getMonitor(), open a bug 
report with the stack trace.  If the problem is the wrong Cairo library, link 
this bug to the one that is tracking this issue.
Tiffany Lu: I think you need to tell me what you want to be investigated here.

The original crash in this bug is with I20050913-0800 (3.2 before M2), is it
reproducable with M2 or newer?
For M20050929-0840 build, it needs libcairo.so.1.
After 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/IES/eclipse/', the problem doesn't exist.

For I20050923-1000 build, it needs libcairo.so.2.
we refer to comment #19, follow the INSTALL file to install Cairo 1.0 
under '/Cairo/cairo-1.0.0' folder, then libcairo.so.2 can be found 
under '/Cairo/cairo-1.0.0/src/.libs'.
After 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Cairo/cairo-1.0.0/src/.libs' then re-run the 
scenairo, the problem doesn't exist.

Since the problem does not exist on v3.1.1 and the problem on v3.2 is reported 
by bug 110942, we would like to close this bug. Please help to update the 
status and we may close it. Thanks.
Sorry! There is a typo in the previous comment, it should be 
"Since the problem does not exist on v3.1.1 and the problem on v3.2 is 
reported by bug 110924, we would like to close this bug. Please help to update 
the status and we may close it. Thanks."
Thanks, closing.
As Comment #26, close the bug.
Thanks.</WithOutStack>
