    <WithStack>Ability to use the four arrow keys (CRTL+ cursor key) to layout precisely 
currently selected shapes in diagrams.  This is available through the 
accessibility feature (pressing the "." key), but there should be a preference 
to make this the default behavior without having to enter accessibility mode.
Ready to commit, but this depends on GMF adopting GEF with Bug 213359
Looks like 198751 is a duplicate for this bug.
*** Bug 198751 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Created attachment 86685
Requirements and Design Document
The behavior has been changed in the GMF Runtime so that the user can now use the arrow keys to move a selected shape. The shape moves immediately when an arrow key is pressed. The Tab and Ctrl + Tab keys are now used to navigate between shapes on the diagram. 


(In reply to comment #5)
This doesn't appear to work on the Mac, or is there some special key combination I should be using? (I tried all those I thought could work) 
Reopening since this does not work on Mac. Mouse cursor moves while arrows being pressed but the underlying node does not.
It does not seem to work on my linux version (kubutu-8.04):
I did have to press '.' once.
Also just pressing the arrow key once did not move the shape, I had to press the key continuously.
This enhancement can remain resolved.

Opened Bug 247585 for the MacOS (and maybe Linux) bug.

Created attachment 28028
Snapshot of my Outline view

Note that there's already an issue in my Outline view as fields were wrongly
repeated several times in it.
Perhaps this problem origin comes from JDT/UI?
The error in question happens when the operating system API that sets the text 
into a menu item fails.  This can happen when an application leaks.  Does this 
happen ever time?

Note that the duplicated tree items might indicate a place where setting the 
text into a tree item failed but we didn't check the return code from the 
operating system.
I got this error only once and it never happens again...
Feel free to set it as REMIND, I'll reopen bug if I get it again.

Hence, this selection logic for connector's won't work for GMF, because in GMF we should be able to select connectors contained by the marquee rectangle regardless whether source and target (not necessarily nodes) are selected or not.

    <WithStack>- Remove special code for selectiing connectors since this has been 
implemented in the GEF selection tool.
Alex can check this one out.
As I understood, we need to modify RubberbandSelectionTool according to the fixes that went in for MarqueeSelectionTool. However, there is still a difference in a way how connections are included into selection between these two tools. The GEF's MarqueeSelectionTool can include connection into selection if both source and target are inside the marquee rectangle, i.e. if both source and target nodes are included into selection. Therefore if marquee rectangle contains connection, but does not fully contain source and target nodes - connection is not selected. The GMF RubberbandSelectionTool doesn't care if source and target nodes are selected and simply selects a connection if it's inside the marquee rectangle, although source and target nodes may not be.

I'm not sure what has to be done with this issue now. Is it ok to have MarqueeSelectionTool logic for selecting connections in GMF? or should we leave RubberbandSelectionTool and raise a feature request agaisnt GEF to support RubberbandSelectionTool connection selection?

GEF MarqueeSelectionTool modification

At the moment this migration is not possible due to the following reasons:

1. Connectors selection (mentioned in the previous comment)
Currently GEF MarqueeSelectionTool is selecting connectors only if it's source and target are selected nodes. Hence, this selection logic for connector's won't work for GMF, because in GMF we should be able to select connectors contained by the marquee rectangle regardless whether source and target (not necessarily nodes) are selected or not. Also filtering of edit parts that cannot be selected in the MarqueeSelectionTool cannot be adpated by RubberbandSelectionTool (edit parts off the current view port won't be selected)

2. The auto-scroll capability
This features alters the way marquee selection rectangle is calculated and feedback added. The marquee rectangle start point should not be translated relative to feedback figure for RubberbandSelectionTool, but it must be translated in MarqueeSelectionTool, which is done in a private method.

My opinion that instead of requesting new features from GEF's MarqueeSelectionTool, it's better to request more extensible MarqueeSelectionTool, i.e. simply modification of visibility for a couple of private methods and variables.

I attached the patch for GEF MarqueeSelectionTool with a modification described above. The patch for migrated RubberbandSelectionTool for proposed MarqueeSelectionTool will be attached next

Migrated RubberbandSelection tool (for modified GEF MarqueeSelectionTool)

The patch for Migrated RubberbandSelection tool for the modified GEF MarqueeSelectionTool
This migration is not possible right now:

1) GEF's behavior for selecting connectors is different from the one from current RubberbandSelectionTool.

2) Due to the auto-scroll functionality of RubberbandSelectionTool it calculates the bounds for the feedback differently from MarqueeSelectionTool and this affects the feedback drawn and calculation of edit parts within that are within the marquee rectangle. Also, GEF's mechanism for filtering out of edit parts that cannot be selected filters out edit parts outside of current view port (private MarqueeSelectionTool#isFigureVisible(IFigure) method)

Marking this issue as to be fixed "later".
LATER/REMIND bugs are being automatically reopened as P5 because the LATER and REMIND resolutions are deprecated.

    <WithStack>On Redhat Linux 8 with the default GTK version (gtk2-2.0.6-8 and
gtk+-1.2.10-22), most dialogs that directly derive from org.eclipse.jface.Dialog
remain empty (gray on gray). For instance, this affects the "Filter Markers"
dialog which is available from the Problems or Tasks view when pressing the
filter button and also some dialogs in the Preferences.

This is a regression since Eclipse-3.1. It worked OK in Eclipse-3.0.1 as well as
3.0.2.

By investigation it turned out that when a dialog is marked resizeable, the bug
does not appear. Therefore, a valid workaround is to change the constructor of
org.eclipse.jface.Dialog such that setShellStyle() includes the SWT.RESIZE flag:

        setShellStyle(SWT.RESIZE | SWT.DIALOG_TRIM | SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL |
getDefaultOrientation());

We suspect, however, that a correct fix must be made somewhere else, since with
Eclipse-3.1 or later on Redhat 8 another problem is that most dialogs are not
correctly sized on open. They always appear in a default size, which is pretty
large, so that dialogs with only little content look bad. This affects the
startup progress monitor, all other progress monitors, the startup workspace
selection dialog, and all "simple" dialogs. It does not affect wizards,
Preferences, TitleAreaDialogs and other complex dialogs.

The same problem with empty dialogs appears on Redhat9 with GTK 2.0.6-8.

I'm marking severity as "major" since this problem makes Eclipse-3.1 unusable on
Redhat8 and 9, and there are Eclipse users (Nortel) which cannot upgrade to
newer gtk due to other software or company restrictions.
While SWT has made an effort to not break running under GTK+ 2.0.6, the 2.0.x
series was rather buggy and not widely deployed.  Red Hat 9 shipped with GTK+
2.2.1, so I'm not sure how you have a RH9 machine with 2.0.6 installed
(half-finished upgrade?).  The release notes for Eclipse 3.0 and higher have all
listed 2.2.1 as the official minimum version.  Adding McQ to the CC in case he
wants to comment on this, see the part about some users being unable to upgrade.

We don't have any RH8 machines here but I can help debug the problem.  The Shell
sizing code changed in 3.1 to address some blank-dialog races and improve the
efficiency of resizing.  In Shell.java, try adding a print in the size allocate
callback here:

int /*long*/ gtk_size_allocate (int /*long*/ widget, int /*long*/ allocation) {
	int width = OS.GTK_WIDGET_WIDTH (shellHandle);
	int height = OS.GTK_WIDGET_HEIGHT (shellHandle);

For a dialog that appears blank, what are the values for width and height that
are reported here?
Following exception is also seen on Redhat8 with the same GTK version, it might
be connected to the "empty dialog" problem:

Veronika, remember this "/ by zero" thing ... ?
See bug 105751 for the division by zero error, which was also regarding Red Hat
8 and GTK+ 2.0.6.  A check for this was added in 3.1.1, can you try with this
release?
We would like to check the 3.1.1 version for the / by zero problem, but
unfortunately we cannot easily exchange the entire platform because Wind River
is doing some magic on the Event Loop in order to achieve SWT / Swing
integration, and this magic is partially bound to 3.1.

Which plugins / libraries should we exchange to check the / by zero fix?
BTW, I verified that the "Empty Dialog" problem appears with Eclipse 3.1.1 as well.

*** Bug 112580 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
With a little hackery, I was able to get GTK+ 2.0.6 to compile on a modern
distribution, and can reproduce the problems.  So, this confirms that the
problem is with GTK+ and not with something else like the window manager.
Created attachment 28274
Patch

The patch is to HEAD but the (one-line) fix is the same for 3.1.

When a GtkWindow is realized, the widget generates a size allocate event,
causing SWT to send an SWT.Resize event.  JFace will only layout its contents
if the application code has not set a size on the window first, and it detects
this by listening for SWT.Resize.  Under GTK+ 2.0.6, the window is realized
after JFace has hooked their listener, confusing JFace into thinking that the
application code has resized the window, causing its layout and window
positioning to fail.

This is specific to GTK+ before 2.2 because Control.getMonitor(), triggered by
Shell.setInitialBounds(), caused the window to be realized, but only for
versions of GTK+ supporting the gdk_screen_get_default call added in GTK+ 2.2.

This is specific to SWT 3.1 because of bug 90326.  We tried to avoid realizing
the Shell too early to improve performance.  Unfortunately, I did not know that
realizing could trigger a size allocation.
*** Bug 111315 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Fixed &gt; 20051014

I'm leaving bug 90326 to decide where best to do the realize to  ensure the best
performance without breaking dialog sizing :)
Shouldn't we only realize early under GTK 2.0.6 and leave the old code alone?
We're already realizing early on newer versions, it's just hidden in a call to
getMonitor().  It is better to make it explicit on all versions, and just try to
better plan when it happens.

Can you provide more information about what you were doing when you saw this?
The aspect you're writing etc.
Here is a minimal sample:

package aj;

public class SomeClass {

    public void doSomething() {
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        new SomeClass().doSomething();
    }

}

package aj;

public aspect MyAspect {

    public interface MyWorld {
    }

    declare parents : SomeClass implements MyWorld;

    pointcut doSomethingInMyWorld(MyWorld myWorld) :
            execution(void SomeClass.doSomething()) &amp;&amp;
            this(myWorld);

    void around(MyWorld myWorld) : doSomethingInMyWorld(myWorld) {
        System.out.println("this works");
    }

}

package aj;

public aspect DoesntCompile {

    public interface MyWorld {
    }

    declare parents : SomeClass implements MyWorld;

    pointcut doSomething(SomeClass someClass) :
            execution(void SomeClass.doSomething()) &amp;&amp;
            this(someClass);

    pointcut doSomethingInMyWorld(MyWorld myWorld) : doSomething(myWorld);

    void around(MyWorld myWorld) : doSomethingInMyWorld(myWorld) {
    }

}
Thanks for the simplified testcase - I have been able to recreate the problem.

This is a compiler bug so reassigning to aspectj.
Created attachment 28111
patch containing supplied testcase

This patch is a patch to be applied to the tests project and contains the
supplied testcase written to fit in with the aspectj testcase structure.
I've applied Helens patch then worked on reducing the test program as much as
possible, this fails:

class SomeClass  {
    public void doSomething() { }
}

aspect DoesntCompile {

    declare parents : SomeClass implements Serializable;

    pointcut doSomething(SomeClass someClass) :
            execution(void SomeClass.doSomething()) &amp;&amp;
            this(someClass);

    void around(Serializable myWorld) : doSomething(myWorld) { }
}

If I directly apply Serializable (i.e. not use declare parents) then it works.
If I change the around advice to take a 'SomeClass' then it works.


Ok ... the problem here is the shadow munger is being concretized before the
type munger that adds the parent has had a chance to take effect.

The message 'illegal change to pointcut' is hopeless.
Before producing the message it is actually looking at the pointcut and checking
that what you are binding 'Serializable' is the same or a supertype of the value
in the pointcut 'SomeClass'.  What you are doing is allowed because all
SomeClass' are Serializable - however, because the declare parents hasnt
occurred yet, we don't know SomeClass is Serializable.

Thats why it works if you either:
a) hardcode SomeClass implements Serializable and dont use declare parents.
b) change the advice to 'void around(SomeClass myWorld)'

what on earth I can do about it ...  hmmmmmmmmm
The actual problem of using the wrong type in the pointcut is checked in two places.

1. ReferencePointcut.resolveBindings
   produces something vaguely helpful like the message: 
     incompatible type, expected SomeClass found
BindingTypePattern(java.io.Serializable, 0)

2. ReferencePointcut.concretize1
   produces the BCException:
   "illegal change to pointcut declaration:
doSomething(BindingTypePattern(java.io.Serializable, 0))"

I propose to remove the check for illegal change to pointcut decl as it:
1. is done too early
2. is duplicating something checked later
3. is an exception for something that should be an error
4. is extremely unhelpful

This issue is that having the Viewport constrained to the children bounds makes it difficult to grow your work area.  The only way is move the children or create a new child and then move it.  There should be a way to bypass the children bounds to create a large work area when scrolled.

I tried the procedure you provided to test.  I set the global breakpoint as the
same line as you shown on attachment.  I got a question on step 9.  I saw the
error in console window when I clicked the step button a couple of times.  Are
you using runtime-eclipse to test it or installed the package to test on main
eclipse?  I got the error shown on console windows when I was using
runtime-eclipse to test.  I think the problem may occur in debug.core
(simulator).  You cannot step over the specific line which is hard coded by
Donny in doing simulator.  Another problem I mentioned in bug report before. 
Sometimes the debugger haven't checked the process status before take parallel
debug actions(step, resume).

Is this bug (and bug 111930) a limitation of the simulator?
The simulator cannot allow to do many steps.  It is limitation of the simulation.

The bug 111930 is a bug.  I think the debugger should check process status
before taking a action.  For example, there are 10 processes in a set.  5
terminated and 5 suspended.  So only suspend button is disabled.  When the user
click on step button for this set, UI will pass the set id and step command name
to debugger.  At this moment, I think the debugger should check which processes
in this set can allow to do step.  In this case, the debugger should pass 5
processes id to internal debugger to do the step.  However, the debugger hasn't
do this checking currently.  Previously, I though to do this checking in UI and
then pass the available processes to debugger, but I think UI may not get the
latest update of process's status.  Do you agree with that?

&gt; 
&gt; Is this bug (and bug 111930) a limitation of the simulator?


In the real debugger, trying to step 5 terminated and 5 suspended processes will result in two events: 

- an error event saying that the 5 processes cannot step because "the program is not being run"
- a step completed event for the 5 suspended processes

In this case, the external debugger can do the checking rather than the UI. I tend to think that this is 
the preferrable way to do it, since the external debugger is really the final arbiter of process state. Do 
you have any thoughts on this?

Unfortunately, the IDebugger/IDebuggerEvent interfaces do not currently provide any means to return 
error events back to the UI, other than causing the command to throw a PCDIException. Perhaps Donny 
can think of a solution?
I agree.  The external debugger is the best role for checking process status.

    <WithStack>It has been suggested that all projects have an eclipse.* top-level newsgroup.
Today, newsgroups names are based on (mostly) the top-level PMC the project
belongs to, e.g., eclipse.webtools.jst and eclipse.tools.cdt. There are
advantages to this, such as having the name space indicate the project's PMC. 
There are disadvantages to this, such as requiring a newsgroup name change when
a project moves from one PMC to another, e.g., from Technology
(eclipse.technology.aspectj) to Tools (eclipse.tools.aspectj).  

Originally the top-level PMCs were conceived of as project maturity levels
(Technology -&gt; Tools -&gt; Platform) but Eclipse has rapidly evolved away from
this. Now the PMCs are technology areas. When the PMCs were maturity levels, the
nested newsgroup names could be seen as indicating project maturity, but no longer.

Thus the proposal that all projects have a top-level newsgroup name, e.g.,
eclipse.jst, eclipse.cdt, eclipse.aspectj, etc.

Comments?
Be aware there is no "rename" feature on innd, and renaming a newsgroup is not
an easy feat. This is why newsgroups to be renamed have been archived in favor
of new groups at eclipse.org.  innd is quite clunky this way, and if we were to
attempt to rename all the newsgroups, I'd suggest we migrate away from NNTP
newsgroups to a web-based forum.

A few links:

http://groups.google.ca/group/news.software.nntp/browse_thread/thread/2bf38d879a00d1ba/10bcce11209cdd4e?lnk=st&amp;q=inn+rename+newsgroup&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#10bcce11209cdd4e

D.
The naming is all messed up in and around the Eclipse project and its 
subprojects.  We should either
a) make all NEW newsgroups be just eclipse.&lt;tl or sub-project name&gt; but leave 
current ones alone
b) do (a) and actively rename all groups.  
c) continue with eclipse.&lt;tl&gt;.&lt;sub&gt; with the exception of the Eclipse project 
and its current and new sub projects.  They curently follow the pattern 
eclipse.&lt;sub-project&gt; (e.g., eclipse.platform)

Actively renaming all groups (b) seems like churn but does result in a 
consistent setup.  a) is simple but will lead to the entire setup being 
inconsistent as new groups are added.  c) leaves some inconsistency around the 
Eclipse newsgroups but is otherwise ok.  It is brittle when things move but 
that happens very infrequently.

+1 for c.

If we eventually fix the Eclipse project's naming problem then the related 
subproject newgroups (e.g., Platform, Equinox, JDT, PDE) can be renamed to 
match the more general pattern.

As for comment 1, I've never been a big fan of the web based forums but do 
agree if we end up renaming everything we can take the opportunity for some 
changes.

-1

I don't think that a web-based forum is a valid migration path for NNTP. At
least I prefere reading NNTP than all those web-based forums available. A
web-based forum can't replace a newsreader.

I don't know if there is a better NNTP server available.
I think the Foundation should move away from incubating all projects under the
Technology PMC. It just doesn't scale well. Projects should be placed where you
think they will end up, and the newsgroup should too. That won't totally
eliminate moves but it will eliminate the biggest reason for them. And BTW,
there haven't been very many moves to start with.

-1 for changing newsgroup names. Since I started reading them with the web forum
mirrors on EclipseZone.com I don't care what the names are anymore. EclipseZone
will be mirroring *all* of the eclipse.org newsgroups and putting them in
functional groups with nice long descriptive names. Even if that weren't an
option, the dotted names give needed organization in my opinion.

-1 to move away from NNTP. Regardless of what you pick there is going to be a
vocal group that wants something else. I think NNTP is fine because content can
be mirrored elsewhere easily and people are used to it. If the forums were only
available in a web format, that would be tough to convert to some other form.
The way it is now you can use a news reader, you can use a web browser, you can
use email, you can use RSS, etc. It's very flexible.
Correcting the facts: re (c) in comment 2: the Eclipse project has one
sub-project that, for grandfathered reasons, follows the eclipse.&lt;sub-project&gt;
and that is eclipse.platform.  All subsequence top-level and sub-projects have
been following the Eclipse Naming Policy
(http://www.eclipse.org/org/processes/project-naming-policy.html) which was
proposed to, reviewed by, and then accepted by, the community.  What we are
discussing in this bug are two things:

(1) a change to the Eclipse Naming Policy section labeled "Infrastructure &gt;
Newsgroups", and
(2) whether or not existing newsgroups should be renamed to conform to such a
change.

Regarding comment 4: the Foundation has already moved away from incubating all
projects under the Technology PMC. There are already new incubating projects
under WebTools and DSDP.
One more comment: not that we already use top-level names for all projects in
the website URLs. For example, the Mylar sub-project of the Technology PMC uses
http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/ rather than
http://www.eclipse.org/technology/mylar. Why do we have one rule for naming
newsgroups and another for URLs?
(In reply to comment #7)
&gt; Why do we have one rule for naming newsgroups and another for URLs?

1. Because Exhibit A* didn't exist back in 2001, when eclipse.org started.
2. Because Exhibit A* doesn't contain a rule for website names.

* Exhibit A = http://www.eclipse.org/org/processes/project-naming-policy.html


There are numerous naming conventions throughout eclipse.org  -- some that are
slowly ironing themselves out, others not. I think Exhibit A should be updated
to include a convention for all the resources at eclipse.org, with a GrandFather
clause that allows current resources to not be renamed for the sake of not
breaking everything.  I'm pretty strung up about making everything standard and
consistent, so feel free to send me packing if some of these proposals are too

&gt; I'm pretty strung up about making everything standard and
&gt; consistent, so feel free to send me packing if some of these 
&gt; proposals are too "ambitious":

I also like the idee of make everything consistent but IMHO there should be only
one rule: keep it simple.

As most of this looks clear to me, I feel that such a strict consitency is too
complicated.

Just a few thoughts:

1. I am one of those guys that remember a project by their "nick" name. I'm
pretty sure there are more like me. Thus, it's absolutly inconvenient for me to
type www.eclipse.org/toplevel/project as the URL. Mostly because it's too long
and sometimes because I don't care about the toplevel the project is categorized
in. I just want to find Mylar or GEF or JDT or the Platform.

-1 for long URLs (WWW, wiki, downloads, whatever)
-1 for long newsgroup names

2. I don't think that there will be ever two projects at Eclipse.org sharing the
same project name but under different toplevel categories.

3. From my understanding a project can move from one toplevel to another. This
means that everything (URLs, newsgroup, list and Bugzilla names) needs to be
changed.

If I would have the choice, I would try to drop the toplevel name everywhere.
It's just a categorization/tagging that is useful within the various Eclipse
processes. However, I don't think that uses will actually care.
Something I forgot to say:

(In reply to comment #8)
&gt; Bugzilla product names
&gt; ======================
&gt; Current: Project (e.g. JDT)
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed: toplevel.project (e.g. Eclipse.JDT)

Bugzilla 2.20 allows categorization of products. IMHO this fits better than
complicated product names, which might make some lists look cluttered.

&gt; Wiki
&gt; ====

I assume that there will be a relation to WWW, i.e. 
www.eclipse.org/mylar
wiki.eclipse.org/mylar
download.eclipse.org/mylar
svn.eclipse.org/mylar
cvs.eclipse.org/mylar

(In reply to comment #9)

Keep it simple and eliminate top-level names.  Few people really understand 
what is in what TL project or why it matters and sub projects definitely move 
around.  That is how we got this bug report in the first place!
Re: comment 11 - eliminating hierarchical names because "few people understand what a top-level project is" is one potential solution. Another solution would be to make top-level projects truely effective. In fact, a counter-argument would be that we need to keep hierarchical names because we need to make the top-level projects more prominent. 

Summarizing the dicussion in this bug so far, we have 5 of the 500 committers expressing an opinion (that's 1%; not really a mandate in any way) and the opinion appears to be:
* Everyone is for consistency
* It's 50-50 as to whether consistency involves eliminating top-level.sub-project or including top-level.sub-project

A decision here will impact bug 116615.
A year without comment... Do we want to do anything with the newsgroups, keeping in mind that shuffling newsgroups around will be very disruptive?

Change: +2 (Bjorn, Jeff)
No change: -2 (Denis, Ed)
Withdrawing this bug due to a lack of interest by the community - I blogged about it (http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/2005/10/newsgroup-names.html), a year has gone by, indifference (http://www.despair.com/indifference.html), oh well, ...
closing</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>It has been suggested that all projects have an eclipse.* top-level newsgroup.

Infocenter help
===============

Current: help.eclipse.org/helpXX, where XX is the version of Eclipse

Currently only available for Eclipse projects, but bug 100635 proposes a
contralized doc so we should plan ahead.


Project vservers
================

Current: project.eclipse.org (e.g.: ecf.eclipse.org)

Proposed: project.toplevel.eclipse.org (ecf.technology.eclipse.org)

This is still relatively new...


What am I missing?

(In reply to comment #8)

&gt; I'm pretty strung up about making everything standard and
&gt; consistent, so feel free to send me packing if some of these 
&gt; proposals are too "ambitious":

I also like the idee of make everything consistent but IMHO there should be only
one rule: keep it simple.

&gt; CVS Proposed: /cvsroot/toplevel/project/component
&gt; WWW Proposed: www.eclipse.org/toplevel/project
&gt; NNTP Proposed: eclipse.toplevel.project
&gt; Lists Proposed: toplevel.project-listname (eclipse.jdt-dev)
&gt; Download Proposed: download.eclipse.org/toplevel/project
&gt; Bugzilla Proposed: toplevel.project (e.g. Eclipse.JDT)
&gt; Wiki
&gt; SubVersion
&gt; Email
&gt; Infocenter help
&gt; Project vservers

As most of this looks clear to me, I feel that such a strict consitency is too
complicated.

Just a few thoughts:

1. I am one of those guys that remember a project by their "nick" name. I'm
pretty sure there are more like me. Thus, it's absolutly inconvenient for me to
type www.eclipse.org/toplevel/project as the URL. Mostly because it's too long
and sometimes because I don't care about the toplevel the project is categorized
in. I just want to find Mylar or GEF or JDT or the Platform.

-1 for long URLs (WWW, wiki, downloads, whatever)
-1 for long newsgroup names

2. I don't think that there will be ever two projects at Eclipse.org sharing the
same project name but under different toplevel categories.

3. From my understanding a project can move from one toplevel to another. This
means that everything (URLs, newsgroup, list and Bugzilla names) needs to be
changed.

If I would have the choice, I would try to drop the toplevel name everywhere.
It's just a categorization/tagging that is useful within the various Eclipse
processes. However, I don't think that uses will actually care.
Something I forgot to say:

(In reply to comment #8)
&gt; Bugzilla product names
&gt; ======================
&gt; Current: Project (e.g. JDT)
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed: toplevel.project (e.g. Eclipse.JDT)

Bugzilla 2.20 allows categorization of products. IMHO this fits better than
complicated product names, which might make some lists look cluttered.

&gt; Wiki
&gt; ====

I assume that there will be a relation to WWW, i.e. 
www.eclipse.org/mylar
wiki.eclipse.org/mylar
download.eclipse.org/mylar
svn.eclipse.org/mylar
cvs.eclipse.org/mylar

(In reply to comment #9)

Keep it simple and eliminate top-level names.  Few people really understand 
what is in what TL project or why it matters and sub projects definitely move 
around.  That is how we got this bug report in the first place!
Re: comment 11 - eliminating hierarchical names because "few people understand what a top-level project is" is one potential solution. Another solution would be to make top-level projects truely effective. In fact, a counter-argument would be that we need to keep hierarchical names because we need to make the top-level projects more prominent. 

Summarizing the dicussion in this bug so far, we have 5 of the 500 committers expressing an opinion (that's 1%; not really a mandate in any way) and the opinion appears to be:
* Everyone is for consistency
* It's 50-50 as to whether consistency involves eliminating top-level.sub-project or including top-level.sub-project

A decision here will impact bug 116615.
A year without comment... Do we want to do anything with the newsgroups, keeping in mind that shuffling newsgroups around will be very disruptive?

Change: +2 (Bjorn, Jeff)
No change: -2 (Denis, Ed)
Withdrawing this bug due to a lack of interest by the community - I blogged about it (http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/2005/10/newsgroup-names.html), a year has gone by, indifference (http://www.despair.com/indifference.html), oh well, ...

I knew this error before, but i have no idea to fix it.  I extended
BreakpointOrganizer in ptp.debug.ui for doing something in "breakpoint view".  I
guess it is because we are using runtime-eclipse and the eclipse cannot
recongize the new BreakpointOrganizer I extended when it loads/unloads the plugins.
I'm no longer seeing these errors. Now they only appear in org.eclipse.debug.core.</WithStack>

I haven't got this error on my machine.  How can you stop the plugin?  Close the runtime-eclipse?  Please tell me how you produce this error.  Thanks.
Yes, start eclipse with PTP. Make sure the PTP plugins are loaded (switch to PTP Runtime &amp; Debug perspectives). Exit from eclipse. Start eclipse again and check the error log.
I think this problem has been fixed.
I'm seeing a similar error from org.eclipse.debug.ui_3.1.1. This is from the PTP 1.0RC3 plugins that have been loaded directly into Eclipse, not from a runtime instance of Eclipse.

    <WithStack>The “Arrange All” command is arrange the shapes and the edges between the 
shapes all together.
In most of the cases the user has a preference of arranging the shapes based 
on his context that we don’t know or based on his preference.
So, if the user:
1- Start visualizes a huge diagram that has too many shapes and edges between 
them. 
2- Arrange manually the classes based on his preference.
3- The edges still looks ugly and confusing. So, the user would like to 
reorganize the edges to look better without changing the shapes positions that 
he chose.

The only solution for problem in the current version is: The user will go and 
change every edges manually (this will take a long time for huge diagrams).
Not yet assigned to a release (assigned to a milestone with the Plan keyword).

Moving to the next release, GMF 2.1. 


We have no plans to work on this enhancement. One of our committers (Alex) spent the better part of five months fixing Arrange for shapes, we simply do not have the time to open up an arrange connections request.

1. In the header you mention this should inherit from GatedShapeEditPart 
eventually.  Is this still true?  The class method signatures seem to support 
this.  What would be the ramfications of making this change.

2. The method "createMainFigure" is never called from anywhere.  Yet the 
getMainFigure is called  using the "getElementPane"  method to return if the 
top level figure is a GatedPaneFigure.  Are these 2 method necessary at all?
#1.  GateEditPart and GatedShapeEditPart could be collapsed into one.    In 
the beginning we wanted to keep two separate editparts but gates themselves 
could contain gates.

#2. Yes we can remove some of these functions... I'm not sure who added 
them.   I believe it was for ease of use.  We probably evolved out of them.

Also,

#3. FixedDistanceGatedPane* should be removed.  

#4. One downside to the current implementation of gates is that their bounds 
are not taken into account  in viewports.  We should move to a design where we 
have some larger figure as a parent and gates within.  We would therefore not 
need to override the paint and clipping region.  

#5. remove GatedFigure.addGate() .. use the GEF default .add() etc.
Also classes should be renamed to something more generic: Border, Bordered etc.
Gate naming issue is captured by bugzilla 113157
Consider making BorderItemContainerFigure private.

You may be right. However, depending on the eventual fix, the feature could be available only for CVS Change Set. In that case, the current component is fine.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>in the Outline view of a java compilation unit, the access/visibility 
modifiers are indicated by colored shapes (green circle = public, red square = 
private, yellow circle = protected, blue triangle = default)

it would be excellent if the package explorer reused a limited form of this 
convention by placing a green circle on public classes, and blue triangles on 
default (=package) classes

the exact way public classes are differentiated visually from non-public 
classes is not so important to me, but being able see this information at a 
glance would be very useful :)
The same problem as in bug 111885. Again, the only way I think this could be
done is with decoration in the background. I'm categorize this to 'decorators'.
This information is fully available in the browsing perspective which renders
types instead of CUs as children of packages.

I tried this several times and it works fine for me.
If this is still reproducible with the new driver, then re-open and include the exact sequence of steps for reproducing the defect.

Keep in mind that you should have a sufficient amount of wait between the time the agent is launched and terminated.
Adding sufficient waiting time manually did solve this problem. This defect will be closed for now.</WithStack>

Could you please provide the BIRT version that you used?
We test with 1.0.1 and current code base. No error finds when we try to create 
new report.
I have installed 1.0.1. I also get to managed it. This is a logic error as you 
first have to create a report project! I didn't know this and just wanted to 
create a report and voila - the exception.
How can you click finish if you don't have project created?
You should get an error message and the new report wizard can not be finished.
Do you get the 1.0.1 release version?
Could you provide more detail to help us reproduce this bug?

Just create a new report. That's what I did. I didn't knew how to create a 
report _project_ so I just create a new report and thze following wizard asked 
for a file name and then I clicked Next &gt; and I can select from the report 
templates then I clicked Finish and voila ...

This doesn't occur anymore if you once have created a report project/report. SO 
it seems to be an initialization problem.
The next and finish button are disabled if no project existing.
That's quite strange that you can click next and finsih.
Which build do you get?
Could you provide more information?
Thanks.

    <WithStack>The new Agent Controller has a framework in place to handle logging.  We need 
to examine the code and make sure that the logging is being leveraged 
effectively.  That is, we need to be calling the logging service in enough 
places to be able to trace what the system is doing, and we need to make sure 
that where we are logging messages, we are using appropriate severity levels 
to allow for clean filtering.

In particular, the previous bugzilla report (79564) included the following 
request:

-Instrument new log messages for all types of situations:

    <WithStack>Mylar should support the browsing of a task context. A scenario is in the 
context of a code review looking at what code has been considered as part of a 
task. As the task context is browsed, the interest model would not change (the 
monitor would be deactivated).
This is trivial to do and will be useful.  We just need a decent UI.  I was
thinking that the context menu for the task list needs to have an
"Activate/Deactivate Task" items in order to follow Eclipse UI guidelines and
help teach people how to click the glasses.  So in addition it could get an
"Active Task in Read-Only Mode" button.  A more natural name for that might be
something like "Review Task".
Seems like a reasonable start. Review task would be a better name than the read-only mode.


This is now supported, but in a slightly different way than originally planned.  Setting
a "read-only" state for each task would have resulted in an overly complicated UI because
the user would need to be made aware of whether a task was in read-only mode or not. 
If this wasn't clear enough things could get very confusing.  This state would need to
be persisted on the task too, and tasks don't know about task conte xts.  Also in addition
to reviewing there is another use case--sometimes it's desireble to put a task into read
only mode in order to check something that's not worth creating a new task for.

So
the UI is that the task list has Pause/Resume Capturing Context buttons on it's local
pull down.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The current logging mechanism in the Agent Controller requires agents to send 
logging messages through the normal control channel.  This has two 
limitations: (1) it prevents us from logging events that occur in shared 
libraries, (2) it prevents us from logging events that are part of the message 
sending mechanism (because it would lead to recursion).

We need a more general mechanism.

One possibility is to open a pipe dedicated to receiving logging messages.
There is a temporary implementation in place.  You must now create a second 
instance of the named pipe transport layer with a pipe name that equals the 
main pipe name with "log" appended to it.  The log pipe TL must be specified 
before the main pipe TL in the serviceconfig.xml file.

In the next release, I intend to make a new component type dedicated to 
logging and allow the name to be more flexible.
Cannot contain this work in 4.2, resetting target to future for now.

The navigator view has a tool bar (Back, Forward, Up, |, Collapse All, Link with

over the text, like a pop-up. I need to minimize and maximize the editor as a

    <WithStack>Hi,
I try make jasperreport view in rcp application and get ClassNotFoundError
when fill report
  Jasper create report class in memory and create class with own classloader
I think that problem is in ContextFinder#basicFindClassLoader()

  this is original method

ClassLoader basicFindClassLoader() {
  Class[] stack = contextFinder.getClassContext();
  ClassLoader result = null;
  for (int i = 1; i &lt; stack.length; i++) {
   ClassLoader tmp = stack[i].getClassLoader();
   if (stack[i] != ContextFinder.class &amp;&amp; tmp != null) {
    result = tmp;
    break;
   }
  }
  if (checkClassLoader(result))
   return result;
  return null;
 }

method search loaders of loaded classes in JVM classloader and if this
classloader isn't good break, but on first class with wrong classloader
When i change class to :

ClassLoader basicFindClassLoader() {
 Class[] stack = contextFinder.getClassContext();
 for (int i = 1; i &lt; stack.length; i++) {
  ClassLoader tmp = stack[i].getClassLoader();
  if (stack[i] != ContextFinder.class &amp;&amp; tmp != null &amp;&amp;
checkClassLoader(tmp)) {
    return tmp;
   }
  }
  return null;
 }

eclipse search all stack loaded class for classloader

After this changes jasperreport work fine

Is this a bug or ... ?
In the recent 3.2 builds we changed the ContextFinder code to return the first classloader of the stack that is neither the ContextFinder classloader nor the boot classloader.
Could you please try it?
Pascal,
  I don't work with 3.2 still (and can't test), but I think that it will work now

I will test when I start with 3.2
I check and it work now, but what is this in basicFindClassLoaders
if (tmp == finderClassLoader || tmp instanceof BundleClassLoader)
   break;
It is possible that we find case when it will fail, too  
another question : is ArrayList necessary for return from this method ? It worked good for first classloader.
If ArrayList is necessary then see this code (line 92)
if (result == null) {
    ArrayList toConsult = findClassLoaders();
    for (Iterator loaders = toConsult.iterator(); loaders.hasNext();)
	try {
	   result = ((ClassLoader) loaders.next()).loadClass(arg0);
	} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
	// go to the next class loader
	}
}
if first loader in list load class this will continue in second loader.
I think that you need break after line
  result = ... (line 96)
Good catch Haris, I reopened bug 130819 where this code got introduced.</WithStack>

Relevant use case:

Proposed patch

Here is a patch which adds a "no fill" button to the color palette. currently this button will only be enabled if you select the "fill color" button.  Also it will only work only in geoshapes (not only because this bug specifies geoshapes, but it involves changing how the figure is painted, which is impossible to generalize, and rather I think clients have to implement it)

a couple things to notice is the new fillstyle, "fillOn", which is set to true as default, and only changed when the noFill button is pressed (at least for no).

I've tested it and the fillOn style is persisted, and i've also made it so the "no fill" button is set to default when the color palette pops up if the shape was previously set to no fill.  Also in the case that no fill is selected, there will be no overlay image for the color.

I've also attached a screenshot to show that everything works.

As we discussed, we do not want to consider committing this until we look at all of the enhancements we want to the notational metamodel
We actually want to support alpha() from 0 to 255.
This bug is indirectly fixed by introducing transparency in 263039. Setting transparency to 100% achieves no-fill effect.

    <WithStack>The AutoGUIRunner documentation at
http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/test/documents/userguides/Intro-Auto-GUI.html needs
to be updated to reflect the new "variable substitution" feature. This feature
permits tests to parameterize certain strings, including the full OS-specific
path to the temporary workspace directory and the directory containing the test
suite. As a result, tests can refer to data files using absolute path names, for
example for Import operations.

    <WithOutStack>The AutoGUIRunner documentation at
http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/test/documents/userguides/Intro-Auto-GUI.html needs
to be updated to reflect the new "variable substitution" feature. This feature
permits tests to parameterize certain strings, including the full OS-specific
path to the temporary workspace directory and the directory containing the test
suite. As a result, tests can refer to data files using absolute path names, for
example for Import operations.

    <WithStack>The server editor framework used to add the horizontal and vertical scrollbar to
the server editor when the server editor size does not fit the content. 
However, the recent driver does not do that anymore.

The problem can be reproduced when using tomcat server.
Fix has been checked into HEAD stream and will be tagged for next I-build.
I am still seeing the same problem in the current WTP M8 driver.
As discussed, this was fixed in M9 with no patch for M8. Please reopen if you're
still seeing this behaviour after moving to M9.
This change is a bulk update of all _un_targeted, fixed, resolved bugs upon release of M5. This particular bug _might_ have been fixed earlier than M5. (Feel free to correct).

    <WithStack>Using the simulator, create a 500 process job. After stopping at a breakpoint, step all processes. It takes 
nearly 30 seconds for the markers to be updated. I also see 500 EndSteppingRangeEvents logged.

Is this just a limitation of the simulator, or is it going to affect the external debugger also? If so then a 
major redesign is going to be required. In particular, I'm not sure why I'm seeing 500 events. There should 
never be 500 events posted in this manner.
I asked donny before.  He said the simulator will send event one by one for each
 process.  For exmaple, UI will receive breakpoint hit event for all processes
one by one if the global breakpoint is created.

The simulator does not have the ability to aggregate multiple events into one,
because of that, it sends multiple events.

    <WithStack>GNU Classpath defines a few external builders -- this project
includes both native code (requiring a 'make') and automatically
generated java source code.

I've noticed that doing a checkout of classpath does not cause
these tool builders to be run.  Instead, after checkout, the build
results in an error.  If I "Clean" the project, the external builders
are run and the build succeeds.

I would like to be able to check out classpath and have the external
builders run automatically.  I couldn't figure out how to do this.

FWIW this is similar to bug #108534, but I'm not sure it is really the same.

As a user it would be convenient if this were explicitly spelled
out on the "Build Options" tab of the external builder's launch
configuration edit dialog.  For instance, a new checkbox saying
"After a checkout".  But, perhaps this is redundant -- arguably a
fresh checkout should be considered as being like the "post-clean" state.

You can easily see this behavior by checking out classpath:

:ext:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/classpath
(no password needed)
module classpath
For various reasons (legal and firewall) I can't checkout GNU classpath. Can someone attach the .project and .classpath files for the project that is failing to build?
Files are also available through http at:
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/classpath/?root=classpath
Do all of the builders fail to run, or only some?  I noticed the builder that runs CreateLocaleData.launch is configured to NOT run during autobuild, so I wouldn't expect that one to build.  This is configured from the Builders property page (click Edit, go to "Build Options" tab).

I also noticed most builders are configured to only run when a resource in a given working set changes.  Darin, how does this work for newly created resources?  When the project is created (via CVS checkout), I assume a builder triggered by a working set would always call for a build?  Perhaps if the build script being called has itself been changed or created, a build should always run?
(In reply to comment #3)
&gt; When the project is created (via CVS checkout), I assume a builder
&gt; triggered by a working set would always call for a build?
Correct

&gt; Perhaps if the build script being called has itself been changed or created, &gt; a build should always run?
The user is in full control to set whether a change in the buildfile triggers a build by choosing whether to include the buildfile in the set of resources that trigger the build on changes.

Sorry Darin, I didn't have my head screwed on right.  Of course when a project is first checked out, the first build is not incremental.  This means there is no delta, so the builder's working set is presumably ignored.

If the following debug flags are added to eclipse/.options, and the "-debug" argument is added to the command line, then all builder activity will be recorded to the console:

org.eclipse.core.resources/debug=true
org.eclipse.core.resources/build/invoking=true

I tried to create a mock copy of the classpath project by grabbing the .project and all external tool builder launch configs from the URL given in comment #2.  When I checked this project out from CVS, the debug statements tell me that all builders ran:

Invoking (FULL_BUILD) on builder: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest)
Builder finished: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest) time: 137ms
Invoking (FULL_BUILD) on builder: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest)
Builder finished: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest) time: 50ms
Invoking (FULL_BUILD) on builder: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest)
Builder finished: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest) time: 135ms

Builder finished: JavaBuilder(zzJohnTest) time: 3ms
Invoking (FULL_BUILD) on builder: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest)
Builder finished: ExternalToolBuilder(zzJohnTest) time: 37ms

So, I can't reproduce the problem with this simulated setup.  If someone could perform the checkout with the above debug options enabled and paste the results here, it might give me more clues. Of course, an attached test case that doesn't involve GNU code would also be fantastic...
We have been using the "trigger on checkout" behavior for the Ant Core and Ant UI plugins of the Eclipse development for 2 years plus...so we cannot reproduce the problem either.
I have been unable to reproduce this (cannot access the GNU classpath repository).  Please reopen with either:

Any news here, John?
Unfortunately I was never able to reproduce the problem.

I was trying to reproduce the issue, but with no luck so far.

I followed the steps from the link developers

Even if I switch autobuild off and do the clean/build after a checkout, the build results in an error. The same error occurs when autobuild is on during a checkout.

Anyway I can see that the external builder are triggered in both cases.

This is running on GCJ.
Thanks for the trace. Reopening for investigation.
Any news here, John?
Unfortunately I was never able to reproduce the problem. 
Build id: N20080117-0010

I was trying to reproduce the issue, but with no luck so far.

I followed the steps from the link developers
http://developer.classpath.org/mediation/ClasspathHackingWithEclipse 

Even if I switch autobuild off and do the clean/build after a checkout, the build results in an error. The same error occurs when autobuild is on during a checkout.

Anyway I can see that the external builder are triggered in both cases.


I can't reproduce it.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>I typically do Java development using the Java Browsing perspective with two 
side-by-side tab-groups in the editors area.  However, when I switch to other 
perspectives, the editor area changes aspect ratio so as to make my editors 
annoyingly narrow.  Also, I get the same issues when I do a comparison.

Right now my only option is to maximize the tab-group I'm working on, but more 
often I'd prefer to "semi-maximize", enlarging the tab-group only to the size of 
the editor area rather than to the whole window.  I'd love to have this 
option(maybe by holding the shift key when I double-click the tab to maximize?), 
and even have the option to make it the default behaviour when I maximize 
editors.
There are currently no plans to work on this feature.

    <WithStack>I'm creating a viewer for a custom table and extending StructuredViewer.  In
StructuredViewer the method getColorAndFontCollector() is protected so I should
be able to access it.  But the return type is ColorAndFontCollector which is
declared as a package level class thus I can't call the method because the
return type isn't visible to viewers outside of the viewers package.
Needs to be fixed for 3.2.
Made the (inner) class ColorAndFontCollector protected.

Fixed &gt;20060213.

Brad, could you please verify that the change actually fixes your problem? Thanks.
Thanks Boris.  I'll try to get this verified this morning.
This fixed the visibility issues but after looking more closely at the ColorAndFontCollector that is in StructuredViewer it doesn't really help me.  It seems odd that StructuredViewer has references to TableItem and TreeItem.  We're extending StructuredViewer for a viewer for a custom table that has its own items.  Is the expectation that StructuredViewer should only be used for Eclipse widgets?

Anyway your changed fixed the visibility conflict.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The Workspace Launcher that prompts user to select the workspace when starting 
Eclipse has hard-coded fonts.

That may not be very harmful on English platform. But for national languages 
(especially DBCS languages), if the default fonts are not setup right, 
characters do not display (for example, the default fonts on Mac OS X are not 
setup right, a separate bug will be opened later). Changing the fonts in 
perferences does not fix the problem on this dialog.

Note that a similar Workspace Launcher (from File&gt;Switch Workspace...) does 
not have hard-coded fonts.

Testcase:
- change the General&gt;Appearance&gt;Colors and Fonts&gt;Basic&gt;Dialog Font preference 
to italic
- exit and restart Eclipse
- the description "Eclipse SDK stores your projects..." is not in italic
Color and font preferences are stored in the workspace preferences, not in the configuration preferences.  
There's no way we can access them before a workspace is chosen.
Are you running another language on an English machine or on a machine that has 
the OS installed in that other language?  I just tried running on a Chinese XP 
machine and the font seems reasonable for Chinese.
Created attachment 28045
launcher on Chinese XP machine
&gt; Note that a similar Workspace Launcher (from File&gt;Switch Workspace...) does 
&gt; not have hard-coded fonts.

This is actually the same code for both dialogs. Just as Kim already wrote, the
problem is that we cannot access the user's preferences at that time because the
preferences are stored with the workspace.

If the default font does not work, then that's a bug that we should (and
probably could) fix.
The Workspace Launcher dialog displays okay on Windows XP (even with DBCS like 
Chinese). You only see the display problem on Mac OS X 10 (see 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=111973).

The concern here is that even when bug 111973 is fixed (by choosing the 
correct default dialog font on Mac OS X), this dialog still will not display 
the characters in the description properly because the wrong font is hard-
coded.

Another situation is for visually impaired people, if they want to set all 
fonts to big fonts, this dialog does not change.

In order to work around that, startup.jar could load osgi with a special
classloader that would ignore the signature. However we would still need to have
an option where the initial code path can be used.
We may be able to create a URLClassLoader with a special 
URLStreamHandlerFactory which can create jar: URLs for us that do no 
verifications.  Look at the following URLClassLoader constructor.

    public URLClassLoader(URL[] urls, ClassLoader parent,
			  URLStreamHandlerFactory factory)
The URLStreamHandlerFactory will not help us out here :(

The problem is the URLClassLoader assumes all URLs which do not end in '/' are jar URLs.  If the URL does not use the file protocol then it downloads the content (not sure where) and then opens the jar file using the JarFile class.  So even if we use our own URLStreamHandlerFactory to intercept file urls the URLClassLoader will still just open the content of the URL with JarFile.  The URLClassLoader constructs JarFile objects using the JarFile(String) which forces verification to occur.  AFAIK there is no way to disable this by extending the URLClassLoader class.

Our only option at this point seems to be to implement our own ClassLoader from scratch to load the framework and its extensions.  At this point I'm not sure how feasible this is.  We would have to implement proper codesource setting, the addURL method ...
A lot of infrastructure would have to be put in place to suppor this. We decided to go with the performance degradation for now.</WithStack>

Did you increase the CVS timeout to see if that helped?
Yes, we increased it to 600s, but the problem remained the same (timeout
exception after waiting for 10 minutes). With the same connection, I don't have
problems with changed or added files - only deletions seem to cause harm.

I also tried it with eclipse 3.0.2 and got the same problem. I guess this
problem now occurs because of a new CVS server version.
It worked for me the first time I tried it but the second time I got a 
different timeout (below). The third time, it worked again. Moving to 
Community/CVS as this does not appear to be an Eclipse problem:

I tested this from my home cable connection, and can't reproduce.

I set up pserver connection as explained, checked out
org.eclipse.core.expressions, deleted
org.eclipse.core.expressions/ElementHandler.java and Synchronize with repository
worked fine about 10 times in a row.

I then introduced a 2-minute delay, re-Sync and all was well.  I then Override
and Update to refetch the deleted file, deleted it again, waited 10 minutes,
Sync with repo.  Worked fine.

Closing as worksforme.  As per bug 113351, we were having intermittent CVS
issues with some of the nodes, and those were solved recently.  Feel free to
reopen if this problem persists.

D.
Reopening. We still or again have the same problem. I'm not sure whether it worked at any point in time, since most of the patches we make don't delete files.

I verified with the link on the committers page that our DNS should be OK:
"Your DNS seems okay! Thanks!"
The IP address given there is not the address in our local LAN, but I don't think that should be a problem here.
Despite my best efforts, I can't reproduce this.  I even tried on a 28.8 modem (!!!)

Sorry guys, if I can't reproduce it, I'm powerless.

Did you increase the CVS timeout to see if that helped?
Yes, we increased it to 600s, but the problem remained the same (timeout
exception after waiting for 10 minutes). With the same connection, I don't have
problems with changed or added files - only deletions seem to cause harm.

I also tried it with eclipse 3.0.2 and got the same problem. I guess this
problem now occurs because of a new CVS server version.
It worked for me the first time I tried it but the second time I got a 
different timeout (below). The third time, it worked again. Moving to 
Community/CVS as this does not appear to be an Eclipse problem:

org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSCommunicationException[-6]: 


I tested this from my home cable connection, and can't reproduce.

I set up pserver connection as explained, checked out
org.eclipse.core.expressions, deleted
org.eclipse.core.expressions/ElementHandler.java and Synchronize with repository
worked fine about 10 times in a row.

I then introduced a 2-minute delay, re-Sync and all was well.  I then Override
and Update to refetch the deleted file, deleted it again, waited 10 minutes,
Sync with repo.  Worked fine.

Closing as worksforme.  As per bug 113351, we were having intermittent CVS
issues with some of the nodes, and those were solved recently.  Feel free to
reopen if this problem persists.

D.
Reopening. We still or again have the same problem. I'm not sure whether it worked at any point in time, since most of the patches we make don't delete files.

I verified with the link on the committers page that our DNS should be OK:
"Your DNS seems okay! Thanks!"
The IP address given there is not the address in our local LAN, but I don't think that should be a problem here.
Despite my best efforts, I can't reproduce this.  I even tried on a 28.8 modem (!!!)

Sorry guys, if I can't reproduce it, I'm powerless.

    <WithStack>In order to do on-the-fly validation of a particular partition, a live reference
to the document's text (the Document and its IRegion?) ought to be readily
available from the IValidationContext.  Today, this is not possible with the SSE
implementation of IValidationContext, which only passes a URL reference.  This
would seem to limit the extension to what's available on disk, or by searching
the workspace one might get at a live editor, but not know which partition is
being referenced.  This could be solved one of three ways, in ascending order of
cleanliness, IMO:

* Pass this information through the loadModel() API which is not particularly
well documented and would seem to be a pass-through for just about anything.

* Implement a new API, like getRegion() in the SSE's IValidationContext and
require users of this interface to castdown to get at this information

* Add getRegion() to provide a well-known way to get this information.  getURL
and getRegion might be mutually-exclusive, depending on the type of validation
to be done.  These might represent two different types of validation operations,
or they could continue to be lumped in the same context?
Also required is a line offset to the partition from the top of the document.
I think you want to take a look at StructuredTextReconcilingStrategyForJSP
as an example of the more "fine grained validators" and how there can be a 
variety of steps in the reconcile/validation process, which call 
reconcileModel(DirtyRegion, IRegion)

Please re-open if this does not acccomplish what you need. 

If I understand correctly, the JSP code accomplishes its validation by brute
force -- grab the model and validate everything.  More specifically, it decides
if validation applies, searches existing buffers for the Document to IFile
mapping resource only to satisfy the API, grabs the existing model, and
validates the entire document!  This is painfully inefficient, especially for
me, where I really do not normally deal with document model at all, only the
CDATA in the SCRIPT tag, and I'd like to be able to register directly on the
script tag and only validate the one script tag which changed.  Performance will
be critical for on-the-fly validation.  Walking the model and locating and
validating all scripts is wasteful when it's relatively simple to just pass a
reference to the IRegion of the fragment my validator is registered on.  This
information is easily available to the code dispatching to the validator.  All
that's required is a change to the API.

I'll take a stab at implementing this way (if I can figure out how to do so) and
get back to you.

In the meantime, at a very minimum, I'd suggest we keep this enhancement open
because, frankly, API enhancement is needed.  The validator APIs should
facilitate this sort of thing.


Sure Adam, I'll leave open as long as you'd like. :) 

But, you are looking at/thinking of "batch" validation. 
And, perhaps you are trying to use that "as you type"? 

From your remarks, I do not believe you looked at 
StructuredTextReconcilingStrategyForJSP as suggested. 
There is no IValidationContext in its methods, but 
methods like 
reconcile(DirtyRegion dirtyRegion, IRegion subRegion)
which I believe do what you want. 
Set some breakpoints there, and type a jsp expression
if you'd like to see "in action". 

There's also a sourceValidation extension point defined 
(and partially documented) in 
sse.ui/exsd.  There are "script" partion types defined for html
(and jsp's with html). so, you could explore registering against that. 
[this won't be API in V1.0, but with yours and others feedback, 
we could get closer]. 

Sorry there's not more time (currently) to directly 
provide the documentation you need. But, I've changed
the title to more accurately reflect what you need 
(which is not a beefed up batch validator). 

Of course, if I've misunderstood, feel free to correct me. 

Ok, sounds like a miscommunication on my part.  I never meant batch validation.
 (I think the bug title I used was basically what you suggested in our sametime
chat :)  It seemed like IValidationContext could almost be used for as-you-type
validation, but as I meant to say in my request, a new API would be okay, too. 
It wasn't obvious to me if the IFile/IRegion references were mutually exclusive.

Yes, I did look at StructuredTextRecStratforJSP and even attempted to describe
what it did in my previous note.  Sorry if I got it wrong, but my understanding
is that it was basically a brute-force workaround that did not make use of any
validators or validation contexts and just validated the whole doc.  Am I wrong?
 I'll go look again.

The code I sent you *DOES* register against the SCRIPT tag and my validator gets
notified appropriately.  Only thing is it doesn't get told is the boudns of the
SCRIPT tag, only the piece of it that changed!  This is my complaint.  Is there
a way to get this info w/o modifying sse.ui or just re-parsing and processing
all SCRIPT tags?  Do we agree that this aspect could be improved, and that it
would make sense to do so?
Can you calculate partitioning for the dirty region passed into reconcileModel()?

partitions = 
    TextUtilities.computePartitioning(getDocument(), 
                                     
IStructuredPartitioning.DEFAULT_STRUCTURED_PARTITIONING, 
                                       dirtyRegion.getOffset(), 
                                       dirtyRegion.getLength(), 
                                       true);

Then check if any of the partition[i].getType() is what you want (probably
IHTMLPartitionTypes.SCRIPT)?  This way you're still only processing the part of
the document that's dirty.

ReconcileStepForMarkup does something similar, but calculates
IStructuredDocumentRegions for the dirty region instead of partitions.
Oh I think I see what you're saying now.

It would be better to have API that allowed an IValidator to accept a partial
document, probably a dirty region.

In ReconcileStepForValidator:

		// pa_TODO need to use dirty region if Validators can ever handle partial file
validation
		IReconcileResult[] results = this.EMPTY_RECONCILE_RESULT_SET;
		if (dirtyRegion != null) {
			try {
				results = validate();
			}
			catch (Exception ex) {
				Logger.logException("EXEPTION IN RECONCILE STEP FOR VALIDATOR", ex);
//$NON-NLS-1$
			}
		}

We could call validate(dr) if the validator allowed it.
I had even written myself a TODO to remind me to investiate this =)

As David mentioned, we would probably need an additional interface for
IValidator that can accept validate(DirtyRegion).
David, FWIW, yes, I am using the sourceValidator extension point and registering
on SCRIPT, just as you said.  (Take a peek at the code snippets I sent and
you'll see :-)

I did this because a) there's an extension point so I can do this easily without
making any mods to the base editor (goodness) and b) because you told me to do
so (going back a couple of months ago... you said not to use the reconciler
thread, if I could help it)

Philip: yes, I think this is exactly where the gap is; just something that
hadn't been fully implemented.  I hacked up a working version myself, which I'll
have to share with you, but of course, I may not have done it the "right" way. 
It would be best if the IValidatorContext expressed all these things formally,
but for now, it seems like all the necessary info can be tucked in the
IncrementalHelper object, at least for the SSE implementation.  (Note that the
Document is already passed in to its constructor, but not used anywhere)  If I
could just get access to the document and region (or, since you've told me how
to get the full region from the dirty region/subregion) the document + dirty
region would be sufficient.  I could cast down to IncrementalHelper to get it,
or the info could be passed through the loadModel() API.

Is that a change you might be able to make in the very short term (M9?) We have
an urgent need for it and would be extremely grateful.
Adam, thanks for your persistence. I understand now (and, understand I was
looking at it wrong, or, more precisly, mis-remembering where we were ... but
Phil's explained it all to me now :) ... we'll take a closer look. 

Oh, also meant to ask, Adam ... to do proper javascript validation, you do need
to keep a "virtual document", validate that (and map errors and offsets back to
original), right?  For example, isn't it common to "include" some javascript
"src", that would have some users set of "library" functions. That library might
contain a method they would call from their &lt;script&gt; region. If that "included
source" was not accounted for, wouldn't the "missing method be seen as an
error"? Or am I missing something again? (Probably something you already sent,
right? :) 

Checked into HEAD.

New interface is ISourceValidator (for partial document validation)

HTMLValidator has been updated to use this new interface.

Probably still needs some review before finalizing API though.
David - sorry, looks like I forgot to respond to your note on the 13th.  At the
moment, I'm only parsing snippets of code, that is individual &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags in
isolation, and am only able to check for syntax (compile-time errors)  I do not
do a complete analysis of the code, so I don't actually know if variables are
defined or assigned, etc.  I'm not sure this is possible to do without actually
running the script, given the way Javascript works.

So there's no need to track down src= references or try to keep track of a full
environment.  Each script partition or document is validated separately.
Marking as fixed.
I believe you said what we've added was sufficent for what you needed right Adam?
Looks good.  As soon as I can get my environment working again :) I'll mark fixed.

One nitpick: should the new validate() API throw a ValidatorException?  Or, is
there nothing the calling code can do anyways, should something go wrong?
This solves the generic case, but still leaves us without the ability to
validate in the existing JSEditor, which to be fair is a separate bug, but one
which we need fixed for M9.

Phil, this would require putting support for reconciling, strategies, and steps
into JavaScript, right?
Phil can confirm this but no, the same strategies used for SSE can now be used
here.  I've been using a very small, almost trivial patch to
JSEditorSourceViewerConfig on top of the 10/28 build with success -- see 115531.
 It would be huge if this could get in the upcoming milestone.

It wasn't obvious to me if the IFile/IRegion references were mutually exclusive.

Yes, I did look at StructuredTextRecStratforJSP and even attempted to describe
what it did in my previous note.  Sorry if I got it wrong, but my understanding
is that it was basically a brute-force workaround that did not make use of any
validators or validation contexts and just validated the whole doc.  Am I wrong?
 I'll go look again.

The code I sent you *DOES* register against the SCRIPT tag and my validator gets
notified appropriately.  Only thing is it doesn't get told is the boudns of the
SCRIPT tag, only the piece of it that changed!  This is my complaint.  Is there
a way to get this info w/o modifying sse.ui or just re-parsing and processing
all SCRIPT tags?  Do we agree that this aspect could be improved, and that it
would make sense to do so?
Can you calculate partitioning for the dirty region passed into reconcileModel()?

partitions = 
    TextUtilities.computePartitioning(getDocument(), 
                                     
IStructuredPartitioning.DEFAULT_STRUCTURED_PARTITIONING, 
                                       dirtyRegion.getOffset(), 
                                       dirtyRegion.getLength(), 
                                       true);

Then check if any of the partition[i].getType() is what you want (probably
IHTMLPartitionTypes.SCRIPT)?  This way you're still only processing the part of
the document that's dirty.

ReconcileStepForMarkup does something similar, but calculates
IStructuredDocumentRegions for the dirty region instead of partitions.
Oh I think I see what you're saying now.

It would be better to have API that allowed an IValidator to accept a partial
document, probably a dirty region.

In ReconcileStepForValidator:

		// pa_TODO need to use dirty region if Validators can ever handle partial file
validation
		IReconcileResult[] results = this.EMPTY_RECONCILE_RESULT_SET;
		if (dirtyRegion != null) {
			try {
				results = validate();
			}
			catch (Exception ex) {
				Logger.logException("EXEPTION IN RECONCILE STEP FOR VALIDATOR", ex);
//$NON-NLS-1$
			}
		}

We could call validate(dr) if the validator allowed it.
I had even written myself a TODO to remind me to investiate this =)

As David mentioned, we would probably need an additional interface for
IValidator that can accept validate(DirtyRegion).
David, FWIW, yes, I am using the sourceValidator extension point and registering
on SCRIPT, just as you said.  (Take a peek at the code snippets I sent and
you'll see :-)

I did this because a) there's an extension point so I can do this easily without
making any mods to the base editor (goodness) and b) because you told me to do
so (going back a couple of months ago... you said not to use the reconciler
thread, if I could help it)

Philip: yes, I think this is exactly where the gap is; just something that
hadn't been fully implemented.  I hacked up a working version myself, which I'll
have to share with you, but of course, I may not have done it the "right" way. 
It would be best if the IValidatorContext expressed all these things formally,
but for now, it seems like all the necessary info can be tucked in the
IncrementalHelper object, at least for the SSE implementation.  (Note that the
Document is already passed in to its constructor, but not used anywhere)  If I
could just get access to the document and region (or, since you've told me how
to get the full region from the dirty region/subregion) the document + dirty
region would be sufficient.  I could cast down to IncrementalHelper to get it,
or the info could be passed through the loadModel() API.

Is that a change you might be able to make in the very short term (M9?) We have
an urgent need for it and would be extremely grateful.
Adam, thanks for your persistence. I understand now (and, understand I was
looking at it wrong, or, more precisly, mis-remembering where we were ... but
Phil's explained it all to me now :) ... we'll take a closer look. 

Oh, also meant to ask, Adam ... to do proper javascript validation, you do need
to keep a "virtual document", validate that (and map errors and offsets back to
original), right?  For example, isn't it common to "include" some javascript
"src", that would have some users set of "library" functions. That library might
contain a method they would call from their &lt;script&gt; region. If that "included
source" was not accounted for, wouldn't the "missing method be seen as an
error"? Or am I missing something again? (Probably something you already sent,
right? :) 

Checked into HEAD.

New interface is ISourceValidator (for partial document validation)

HTMLValidator has been updated to use this new interface.

Probably still needs some review before finalizing API though.
David - sorry, looks like I forgot to respond to your note on the 13th.  At the
moment, I'm only parsing snippets of code, that is individual &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags in
isolation, and am only able to check for syntax (compile-time errors)  I do not
do a complete analysis of the code, so I don't actually know if variables are
defined or assigned, etc.  I'm not sure this is possible to do without actually
running the script, given the way Javascript works.

So there's no need to track down src= references or try to keep track of a full
environment.  Each script partition or document is validated separately.
Marking as fixed.
I believe you said what we've added was sufficent for what you needed right Adam?
Looks good.  As soon as I can get my environment working again :) I'll mark fixed.

One nitpick: should the new validate() API throw a ValidatorException?  Or, is
there nothing the calling code can do anyways, should something go wrong?
This solves the generic case, but still leaves us without the ability to
validate in the existing JSEditor, which to be fair is a separate bug, but one
which we need fixed for M9.

Phil, this would require putting support for reconciling, strategies, and steps
into JavaScript, right?
Phil can confirm this but no, the same strategies used for SSE can now be used
here.  I've been using a very small, almost trivial patch to
JSEditorSourceViewerConfig on top of the 10/28 build with success -- see 115531.
 It would be huge if this could get in the upcoming milestone.

    <WithStack>In order to use external (non-eclipse, 3rd party) code to do operations like
Validation, strings will result which will be localized by that external code. 
The current IMessage interface, used by validation, assumes a string bundle. 
While that's good for enforcing i18n while within the bounds of an Eclipse

A solution would seem to require changes to the SSE base.  One workaround would
be to stuff a localized message as an override to the bundle in an attribute,
like getAttribute("localizedMessage")  A more formal API change would be preferable.
Amy, I hope you understand the technical details of this request better than I. 

I understand the need for it, but not sure what's "in the way". I know some teams 
have done this e.g. with XML Validation messages from Xerces ... do they "wrap"
them somehow? Or make a copy?

At least two different behaviors I could distinguish:

In AJDT Editor, when I write a field/variable name, and dot (field.), the
auto-completion dialog doesn't show, I have to press ctrl + space.

Also compile errors are only shown when the file is saved. Supose I write 

new Object.doIt();

There is no error until I save the file (either an actual aspect or a java class
opened in AJDT Editor). 

I am considering to use AJDT editor for either java classes and aspects, since
if I don't do this, methods like "aspectOf()" are not seen by Java Editor and
are marked as error (not in Problems View, but in the editor ruler).
Using this bug report to track the autocompletion issue as we already have a report open for the other issue - see bug 93772.  Content assist auto-activation should obey the settings for the Java editor.
Now fixed - it seems that the completion processor wasn't getting initialized properly and was not told the auto activation characters ('.' in this case). Fixed in the following builds:

    <WithStack>To reproduce:

1) Create your own Messages class without a BUNDLE_NAME constant.
2) Go to the class you want to externalize and run the externalization wizard.
3) Point the externalization wizard to your custom Messages class.

6) Although the wizard points the same messages.properties file and Messages

externalized in step 2.

Cause:

The externalization wizard looks for the BUNDLE_NAME constant in the Messages 
class (the default Messages class has a private BUNDLE_NAME constant).  If the 
constant doesn't exist, the wizard starts the keys from 0.  If it does exist 
but doesn't point at the correct messages.properties file, the wizard will 
produce errors on any keys not in the BUNDLE_NAME constant’s 
messages.properties file (even if the wizard is pointed at the correct 
messages.properties file).

Solution:

The wizard should check the keys from the messages.properties file pointed to 
by the wizard, not by the messages.properties file pointed to by the 
BUNDLE_NAME constant in the Messages class.

Out of curiosity, what do you ship on OS X?
We are not shipping anything on OS X. But "Apple Mac OS X 10.3" is a supported 
OS for Eclipse 3.1.1. This problem will cause plugin developers not able to 
display translated dialogs on OS X.
We should be using the default system font - we don't override the dialog font in the jface properties.  In 
the eclipse launcher we set the system org.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts to true.  It could be that 
the small font supplied by carbon doesn't have the required characters.
Try disabling that property in the ini file, does this fix the problem?
Kit: have you had a chance to try Billy's suggestion?
Billy, were you talking about the eclipse\configuration\config.ini? I only saw 
a few settings for osgi like osgi.splashPath. I didn't see anything related to 
font.
There's another configuration file buried in the Eclipse.app package.  In the eclipse folder, control-click on 
the Eclipse icon and choose Show Package Contents.  In the new window that appears go into Contents/
MacOS and edit the eclipse.ini file found there.  Note that to be able to open the package contents you 
may need to have the Apple development tools installed.
I tried removing the -Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts line in 
Contents\MacOS\eclipse.ini. It didn't help. Results are still the same.
Passing along to SWT to adjudicate.  
Isn't this the bug in the TXNObject that we fixed already?  Note that the DBCS 
text fails only in the text widget, not in a button.
I think you are right, Steve.

In the screenshoot, isn't that a read-only text widget ? If so we have enabled 
font substitution on this widget about 2 or 3 weeks ago.


Please, retest this problem using this week integration build and report the

    <WithStack>I tried profiling the same application on the same machine, but with two
different agents. One of the agents sends back the fully qualified name, the
other only the short hostname. One sends two IPs back (one for the loopback) and
the other sends only one.

The loaders are currently not able to recognize that these two are actually the
same machine, if I profile one agent after the other (separately). It creates a
duplicate node in the profiling monitor (one has fully qualified host name, the
other doesn;t).

The enhancement I am requesting is to make the loaders a little more tolerant to
such differences, and be able to better recognize the hosts. There is enough
information here because they have the same hostname (domain not considered) and
share a common IP address. This should be sufficient to recognize that it's the
same host.

The fact that the agents are sending different things is something we are
following up on separately, but thought I should also open this to add tolerance
in the loaders.

The following is the header that our agent generates on a machine called sun450:

Bob, I had envisioned a unified WTP calendar that pulled together event information such as conference and other presentations, milestone and release dates, meetings, etc. This didn't happen and you're right that the calendar became more or less useless.

    <WithStack>using 3.1.1

CompoundContentAssistProcessor#getContextInformationValidator usually returns
CompoundContentAssistValidator.  CompoundContentAssistValidator has a list of
all CompoundContentAssistProcessor's child processors' validators.

In CompoundContentAssistValidator#install, only the validator associated with
the current IContextInformation is installed.  However, in
CompoundContentAssistValidator#isContextInformationValid all child validators,
including ones that were not installed, are asked if context information is
valid.   This likely results in a NPE because the validator was not installed.
Basically, you either use 1 validator that's already associated with a
prewrapped context information, or you use a list of child validators.  So when
you install, you either install the 1 validator or the list of validators.  Same
with when you ask isContextInformationValid.


The fix should look a little something like the below (something similar also
need to be done to CompoundContentAssistValidatorEx#install):

public void install(IContextInformation info, ITextViewer viewer, int
documentPosition) {
	// install either the validator in the info, or all validators
	fValidator = getValidator(info);
	if (fValidator != null)
		fValidator.install(info, viewer, documentPosition);
	else {
		for (Iterator it = fValidators.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
			IContextInformationValidator v = (IContextInformationValidator) it.next();
			v.install(info, viewer, documentPosition);
		}
	}
}

public boolean isContextInformationValid(int documentPosition) {
	// use either the validator in the info, or all validators
	boolean isValid = false;
	if (fValidator != null)
		isValid =fValidator.isContextInformationValid(documentPosition);
	else {
		for (Iterator it = fValidators.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
			IContextInformationValidator v = (IContextInformationValidator) it.next();
			isValid |= v.isContextInformationValid(documentPosition);
		}
	}
	return isValid;
}
And in case you are curious as to why you get either 1 validator or a list. 
When CompoundContentAssistValidator#install is called, you are passed an
IContextInformation.  If the user deliberately asks for context information, a
WrappedContextInformation is passed in.  And it contains the appropriate
associated validator.  
  However, install can also be called when user selects a specific content
assist proposal from the content assist popup.  Then the context information
passed in is the one associated with the content assist proposal
(ICompletionProposal#getContextInformation)  This will not be a wrapped object.

I think a more correct way to fix this bug would be to put a wrapper around
ICompletionProposal so that when getContextInformation is called, a
WrappedContextInformation is returned.  But wrappers, especially on an object
that may or may not implement an extension interface (like ICompletionProposal,
ICompletionProposalExtension, etc) do not sound good.
CompoundContentAssistProcessor is not provided by Eclipse SDK. Did you mean some
other class or is this bug for wtp?
I believe Amy meant the 
CompoundContentAssistProcessor
in
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text

We are not using that class per se, but used a very similar 
"copy" in WTP, to accomplish similar function in WTP editors, 
where we found (and fixed) the bug ... so .. .I think Amy is 
just providing this as helpful info, in exchange for you providing 
that help helpful internal class to begin with.


Should have done my quick check in 3.1.1 and not HEAD: this class is gone.

Tom, please check whether the described bug exists in the new implementation.
(In reply to comment #5)
&gt; Tom, please check whether the described bug exists in the new implementation.

Will do.

On a side note:
I removed the validator from the new API of CompletionProposalComputer since it
does not make sense to have a single validator for all proposal kinds - the
problems with CompoundContentAssistValidtor stem exactly from this problem:
different proposals may have different validation strategies.

The validator should be added to an improved ICompletionProposal(ExtensionX)
interface.
This problem does not currently occur in the 3.2 stream, since the wrapping CompoundContentAssistProcessor does not exist any longer. In the Java world, we only have a single validator, the one for parameter lists, so we are not currently affected. Since ICompletionProposalComputer does not specify a validator, we don't have the issue currently.

If we ever come up with an ICompletionProposalExtensionX (and an abstrac base class with a default implementation) that has its own validator, we can always delegate getContextInformationValidator() to the proposal.

Fixed in 3.2
verified this no longer exists in eclipse 3.3</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>using 3.1.1

CompoundContentAssistProcessor#getContextInformationValidator usually returns
CompoundContentAssistValidator.  CompoundContentAssistValidator has a list of
all CompoundContentAssistProcessor's child processors' validators.

In CompoundContentAssistValidator#install, only the validator associated with
the current IContextInformation is installed.  However, in
CompoundContentAssistValidator#isContextInformationValid all child validators,
including ones that were not installed, are asked if context information is
valid.   This likely results in a NPE because the validator was not installed.
Basically, you either use 1 validator that's already associated with a
prewrapped context information, or you use a list of child validators.  So when
you install, you either install the 1 validator or the list of validators.  Same
with when you ask isContextInformationValid.


The fix should look a little something like the below (something similar also
need to be done to CompoundContentAssistValidatorEx#install):

public void install(IContextInformation info, ITextViewer viewer, int
documentPosition) {
	// install either the validator in the info, or all validators
	fValidator = getValidator(info);
	if (fValidator != null)
		fValidator.install(info, viewer, documentPosition);
	else {
		for (Iterator it = fValidators.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
			IContextInformationValidator v = (IContextInformationValidator) it.next();
			v.install(info, viewer, documentPosition);
		}
	}
}

public boolean isContextInformationValid(int documentPosition) {
	// use either the validator in the info, or all validators
	boolean isValid = false;
	if (fValidator != null)
		isValid =fValidator.isContextInformationValid(documentPosition);
	else {
		for (Iterator it = fValidators.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
			IContextInformationValidator v = (IContextInformationValidator) it.next();
			isValid |= v.isContextInformationValid(documentPosition);
		}
	}
	return isValid;
}
And in case you are curious as to why you get either 1 validator or a list. 
When CompoundContentAssistValidator#install is called, you are passed an
IContextInformation.  If the user deliberately asks for context information, a
WrappedContextInformation is passed in.  And it contains the appropriate
associated validator.  
  However, install can also be called when user selects a specific content
assist proposal from the content assist popup.  Then the context information
passed in is the one associated with the content assist proposal
(ICompletionProposal#getContextInformation)  This will not be a wrapped object.

I think a more correct way to fix this bug would be to put a wrapper around
ICompletionProposal so that when getContextInformation is called, a
WrappedContextInformation is returned.  But wrappers, especially on an object
that may or may not implement an extension interface (like ICompletionProposal,
ICompletionProposalExtension, etc) do not sound good.
CompoundContentAssistProcessor is not provided by Eclipse SDK. Did you mean some
other class or is this bug for wtp?
I believe Amy meant the 
CompoundContentAssistProcessor
in
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text

We are not using that class per se, but used a very similar 
"copy" in WTP, to accomplish similar function in WTP editors, 
where we found (and fixed) the bug ... so .. .I think Amy is 
just providing this as helpful info, in exchange for you providing 
that help helpful internal class to begin with.


Should have done my quick check in 3.1.1 and not HEAD: this class is gone.

Tom, please check whether the described bug exists in the new implementation.

the EJB create wizard is changing. there was a bug that prevented it from being

    <WithStack>The subject pretty much says it all but does org.apache.axis really need
org.eclipse.tomcat? This drags in a complete appserver into our batch tool
infrastructure making it more heavyweight than necessary. Jeffrey speculated
that this dependency is to resolve servlet.jar. Isn't there a better way to
do this in WTP?
I'll see what we can do. At present, yes, Axis needs Tomcat as a provider of 
servlet.jar. We tried including our own copy of servlet.jar but all sorts of 
legal bells started ringing, so we backed off. Is this really a "major" issue?
Chris,

It's major in that we're trying to remove bloat from our batch headless product
and I'm forced to look into questionable dependencies that get dragged in.
FYI ... we had some similar requirement in JSP/Taglib function. 
In our case, it was isolated enough we could easily list the tomcat plugin
as "optional", and if it wasn't there, we just didn't do that part of 
the function (it is for content assist, validation).  I believe we do 
check for a "class not found" sort of exception, and just "do nothing" 
if that function should ever be accidently executed without the plugin in the
stack (would not happen normally, just if someone was "messing around" 
with plugins). 

If you are really using tomcat to launch a web app, that should be 
possible for you as well .. of course, if you are using it for some
intricate function, could take a lot of work. 

Again .. just FYI. 


Via bug 136954, org.apache.tomcat has been removed from org.apache.axis. We don't suspect any fallout from this (specifically wrt. the emitters running within Eclipse), but still have to verify this.
please verify all is is well in RC1. 

FYI.  I've tested the Axis emitters in the WTP 1.5RC1 200604191317 build.  The smoke tests are running smoothly as before.
As we are trying to close down WTP 1.5, please get the latest WTP 1.5 driver to verify the bug and reopen if the problem had not been fixed.  If this defect is not verified/reopened by end of day 06/16, I'll attempt to verify the defect by reproducing the problem as described in the defect.  However, since you know your scenario best, it would be more appropriate if you verify the fix.

5. Press "close" of the newly created dialog, at this point, the 
display.getActiveShell will return 0 rather than shell 2's handle. The same 
output happened while you press "print active shell handle" button.
Created attachment 28054

Changed shellCallback to set active shell during shell activation.
Lynne,

I just tried but found the problem still exists, could you take a look? Thanks.
The change has not been released to the ercp repository.
Please don't mark bugs "FIXED" until the code is released to Eclipse CVS and
available for someone to build and verify.
Fix out in ercp repository.

If you compare v1.8 and v1.9 of WizardProjectsImportPage you will see the 2 
unread local variables.  I think the stricter warnings has just brought this to 
our attention.  I can try removing the code and running the Data Transfer tests 
to see if this makes a difference.
I was going to release fix for this as part of the fix for another bug but Doug 
beat me to the punch.  Revision 1.20 of WizardProjectsImportPage.

Chuck, as your team owns the J2EE model is there someone on your team that can write a tutorial covering the migration of existing projects to WTP?
Hi sure....   not completely sure what is being asked..    consuming a j2ee project or sample like sun's petstore?     Or migration of previous workspaces or releases.....


I believe the original request was a tutorial that covers how to import an existing Web project into Eclipse. This Web project is not a project that was developed using WTP or even necessarily Eclipse. That's why I suggested using a well known Web app such as PetShop as the example in the tutorial.
I'm reassigning to the website component as tutorials fall under its umbrella.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The TPTP automation framework (used for executing TPTP services outside of
Eclipse via command and ant scripts) is currently located in the execution
plug-in, I'd like to petition to have this moved to a separate plug-in.  It has
no compile-time dependencies on others TPTP components.  At run-time, using
extension points, the TPTP test.tools.core plug-in contributes a test execution
service into the framework.

I suggest "org.eclipse.tptp.automation" -- it is a common component that could
be evolved further and contributed upstream to the Eclipse platform potentially.
 I would like to see it grown into a full-fledged automation server for Eclipse.

I would like to petition for the moving of the file system services (file
transfer services) component to a separate plug-in.  The file transfer
functionality is separate from the execution framework and is pluggable, no need
to further couple it in the sample plug-in.

I will suggest "org.eclipse.tptp.platform.services" or
"org.eclipse.tptp.platform.filesystem.services" or
"org.eclipse.tptp.platform.agents.filesystem", or etc
I am targeting this for 4.2. I hope to start exploration of how to refactor 
the TPTP platform execution framework. The actually implementation may need to 
be deferred for 5.0 release as it is likely to change existing API.
Makes sense to move it to a seperate plugin - we will not be able to do so in 4.2 i2 and hence deferred to future. I will bring this up in the Platform call for discussion.

    <WithStack>If incorrect executable name is placed in the cmdLineArgument field for a 
process being launching on Linux platform, bad behavior results:

1)a duplicate tptpProcessController is created
2)the PC reports a TPTP_Error to the client but also reports processStarted
ConsoleTestClient demonstrated the problem when the cmdLineArg (SetParameter)
setting for the startProcess command had a typo in the pathname of the exe. 
Note that the applicationName field was correct (no typo). This set off a 
chain of unfortunate events.

The ConsoleTestClient received a processStarted msg with a bad pid followed by 
a processStarted msg with a good pid, both from the PC, then hung because it 
could not setup a data handler.

The problems:
The Linux impl of launching a process (taken from the RAC) uses the cmdLineArg
[0], not the executable arg name passed in.  Thus we had a failed launch, but 
couldn’t see any hint of it, for 2 reasons:
1) the debug messages (which were visible ) displayed the exe name, not the 
cmdlineArg
2) worse yet, the ProcessController had opened a stdout and bound it to a 
named pipe (in preparation for handing it off to the app being launched), so 
the error message printed by hc_launchProcess() plus several other messages, 
went off down that named pipe rather than appearing in the ProcessController's 
console window.  Eventually, the PC closed that handle so we then had output 
showing on the PC's console again, not realizing that a hole existed in what 
we were seeing.

The PC did not recognize the error returned by hc_launchProcess() because I 
had changed the calling function to check for TPTP_INVALID_PID, but did not 
make the Linux hc_launchProcess() return TPTP_INVALID_PID, so it was 
returning -1. (We can’t use -1 since PID is an unsigned int, so I made 
TPTP_INVALID_PID = 0.)  Hence, the PC didn’t catch the error that had occurred 
at launch time.  Fixing the code so that it returned TPTP_INVALID_PID caused 
the ProcessController to send a TPTP_Error msg, rather than a processStarted 
with a bad pid, but the 2nd processStarted was still being sent to the 
client.  

The ProcessController was sending it because as the parent of the forked child 
it only knew that the fork was successful and happily returned that valid pid, 
reporting to the client that a process had launched.  But because the exec() 
failed, we had a 2nd copy of the tptpProcessController exe running, not the 
user's app.

We can avoid this situation by always checking that we have a good executable 
name so that the exec() doesn't fail. So, by changing the exec() to use the 
exe parameter as the pathname to launch (because it was getting validated)we 
should see success, but a missing return statement in the checking code 
resulted in a false positive on the validation.

The solutions:
1) return TPTP_INVALID_PID from the launch functions and have the calling 
function check for both TPTP_INVALID_PID and a negative pid value.
2) make the forked process exit (not return) if the execve() fails so that we 
don't end up with extra copies of the process controller running
3) use the exe parameter rather than cmdLineArgs[0] in the execve() call 
because that is what is expected and that is what gets validated
4) fix checkExecutable() so that it returns failure if the STAT fails

This does not include a solution to the problem of the process controller 
returning a processStarted msg if we get into the launch code and the exec() 
fails. It relies on the caller of hc_launchProcess()to make sure a good exe 
pathname is passed in so that the exec never fails.

    <WithOutStack>If incorrect executable name is placed in the cmdLineArgument field for a 
process being launching on Linux platform, bad behavior results:

1)a duplicate tptpProcessController is created
2)the PC reports a TPTP_Error to the client but also reports processStarted
ConsoleTestClient demonstrated the problem when the cmdLineArg (SetParameter)
setting for the startProcess command had a typo in the pathname of the exe. 
Note that the applicationName field was correct (no typo). This set off a 
chain of unfortunate events.

The ConsoleTestClient received a processStarted msg with a bad pid followed by 
a processStarted msg with a good pid, both from the PC, then hung because it 
could not setup a data handler.

The problems:
The Linux impl of launching a process (taken from the RAC) uses the cmdLineArg
[0], not the executable arg name passed in.  Thus we had a failed launch, but 
couldn’t see any hint of it, for 2 reasons:
1) the debug messages (which were visible ) displayed the exe name, not the 
cmdlineArg
2) worse yet, the ProcessController had opened a stdout and bound it to a 
named pipe (in preparation for handing it off to the app being launched), so 
the error message printed by hc_launchProcess() plus several other messages, 
went off down that named pipe rather than appearing in the ProcessController's 
console window.  Eventually, the PC closed that handle so we then had output 
showing on the PC's console again, not realizing that a hole existed in what 
we were seeing.

The PC did not recognize the error returned by hc_launchProcess() because I 
had changed the calling function to check for TPTP_INVALID_PID, but did not 
make the Linux hc_launchProcess() return TPTP_INVALID_PID, so it was 
returning -1. (We can’t use -1 since PID is an unsigned int, so I made 
TPTP_INVALID_PID = 0.)  Hence, the PC didn’t catch the error that had occurred 
at launch time.  Fixing the code so that it returned TPTP_INVALID_PID caused 
the ProcessController to send a TPTP_Error msg, rather than a processStarted 
with a bad pid, but the 2nd processStarted was still being sent to the 
client.  

The ProcessController was sending it because as the parent of the forked child 
it only knew that the fork was successful and happily returned that valid pid, 
reporting to the client that a process had launched.  But because the exec() 
failed, we had a 2nd copy of the tptpProcessController exe running, not the 
user's app.

We can avoid this situation by always checking that we have a good executable 
name so that the exec() doesn't fail. So, by changing the exec() to use the 
exe parameter as the pathname to launch (because it was getting validated)we 
should see success, but a missing return statement in the checking code 
resulted in a false positive on the validation.

    <WithStack>The TPTP automation framework (used for executing TPTP services outside of
Eclipse via command and ant scripts) is currently located in the execution
plug-in, I'd like to petition to have this moved to a separate plug-in.  It has
no compile-time dependencies on others TPTP components.  At run-time, using
extension points, the TPTP test.tools.core plug-in contributes a test execution
service into the framework.

I suggest "org.eclipse.tptp.automation" -- it is a common component that could
be evolved further and contributed upstream to the Eclipse platform potentially.
 I would like to see it grown into a full-fledged automation server for Eclipse.
Scott, please discuss with Guru. We need a proposal and it should be reviewed 
by the AG.
Investigation is planned for 4.2. However, the actual implementation is likely 
to be deferred to next major release as changes existing API.
I will document this and work with Sri and table it for AG. Deferring it to future due to the shortened 4.2i2.

Fixed.  I forgot to check the set name to re-register the process.  My idea is
that only show registered processes in debug view which are shown in parallel
debug view.  For example, there are 10 processes.  0, 2, 4, 6, 8 are registered
into debug view.  When you created a new SET which contains 6-9 processes,
process 6 and 8 will be shown in debug view only.  Process 0, 2 and 4 are
temporary unregistered from debug view.  When switch to the Root set, the
process 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 will show in debug view again.  The same principle in
changing job.  When the job is changed, all registered processes in the
previously job will be unregistered in debug view and register the registered
processes in Root set in current job.

    <WithStack>When you start he perfmon agent, the Agent Control, Statistical Graph, and Graph
Summaries view are all stacked on top of each other (see attached screenshots).

Rather it would be nice to see a layout where the Statistical Graph view and
Graph summaries are tiled on top of each other, respectively.  In addition,
putting the Agent Control view tiled below the Profile Monitor view.  This
layout makes the best effective use of these three windows at once (see
screenshots).  

I believe this should be the default when opening the stats view because you can
enable counters without having to flip between the tabs of the views. Also, you
can see the Advanced descriptor settings of each element in the Graph summaries
without having to resize the Graph Summaries view.

Proposed Workbench Layout
Low priority so moving request to 4.2
Right, I've changed the default view layouts so that they reflect the layout in your proposed layout image. The Graph View is unchanged, the Graph Summaries View is layed out below, and the agent control view is stacked ontop of the PropertySheet place holder. This is the only one in the bottom left, so it is positioned correctly but the Profiling and Logging perspective seems to enforce a 80:20 split on the left which results in a controls view that is a little small. 

I'm going to try and get that changed in the trace team though.

Proposed Workbench Layout
Low priority so moving request to 4.2
Right, I've changed the default view layouts so that they reflect the layout in your proposed layout image. The Graph View is unchanged, the Graph Summaries View is layed out below, and the agent control view is stacked ontop of the PropertySheet place holder. This is the only one in the bottom left, so it is positioned correctly but the Profiling and Logging perspective seems to enforce a 80:20 split on the left which results in a controls view that is a little small. 

I'm going to try and get that changed in the trace team though.

    <WithStack>It might be a few days early for this request, but bug #92341 has SWT.VIRTUAL 
support almost done for Trees (commented out in win32, but available).

There is an ILazyContentProvider for TableViewer. This is a request for 
something similar that works in the TreeViewer.
This is planned for 3.2 M4.
Reminder for myself: when marking this fixed, the EXPERIMENTAL tags in the new
API should be removed.
Sorry, I wasn't able to complete this in time for M4, but I'm almost there.

If you want to have a look, the new API (marked as experimental) is TreeViewer.setChildCount(), TreeViewer.replace(), and ILazyTreeContentProvider.

We still have disabled (and otherwise failing) test cases though.
Ouch. We have a new CDT feature dependent on this. Does the feature as it is in M4 usable so we can start development on it (knowing the APIs will change for M5)?
I don't think the API will change much. In fact, having early adopters would be great, so please start developing and contact me directly for any questions.

As I said, we still have test failures, so the feature is not fully useable. Unless there are remaining SWT bugs in the virtual tree, I should be able to finish the work for the first or second integration build in the M5 cycle.
I was wondering what the correct method to update the tree after a model change. I replace and setChildCount the root item that changed, but I'm not sure how to find out which children are visible so that I can update them as well. Actually, I was expecting the viewer to do that automatically anyway. Using viewer.refresh() doesn't work, it only clears the whole tree out.
refresh() should do it, but there seems to be a bug that causes the viewer to clear the whole tree. I will look into this after the holidays. Merry Christmas!

patch for fixing refresh()

This patch should fix the refresh() problem (also described in bug 122178)
*** Bug 122178 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
With the patch, there are still test failures on the Mac and on Linux/GTK, so I cannot release it yet.
Just to let you know - SWT is going to change the behaviour of the virtual tree: getItems() and similar methods will trigger the SetData event too.

This change will go in after tomorrow's integration build, and building on that, I will finish the virtual support in TreeViewer.

Two remaining failures on Linux/GTK due to bug 126299.
good to go on Mac OS.
Looks good on Windows (except that my workaround for bug 126300 had a bug).

Note to self: in setChildCount(), call disassociate(), not unmapElement(). 
Fix released to HEAD &gt;20060206.

Please note that the API of the lazy content provider might still change (an additional parameter for both methods) depending on the outcome of bug 126300.

Verfied by looking at the code in the imported JFace plug-in.

I hope that interested parties start using this soon in order to shake out potential remaining issues.
As soon as we get the CDT working with M5 :)

Thanks Boris!
With a virtual TableViewer, when getTable().selectAll is called, the TableViewer#getVirtualSelection() method will "updateElement" on items not yet updated so they can be added to the selection list.

If 3 of 200 items are visible, all 200 will be added to the ISelection whether they were displayed or not.

In a virtual TreeViewer after a getTree().selectAll(), I belive the AbstractTreeViewer#getSelection() call will only add the 3 items and not the others (item.getData() is still null on the remaining ones).

I assume that this will also affect preservingSelection -- If I select 100 items, refresh/resort the control, and only 10 fit on the screen after the refresh and hence only 10 have 'SetData', the remaining 90 are no longer selected, which is different than a non virtual table.

(Another thing to try: select a row, quickly scroll down a few thousand rows, and mark the selection end (CTRL+click on win32), and see which rows have been selected -- not all have been SetData'd)  but if the table wasn't virtual, all rows would have been added to the selection.  This doesn't seem consistent either).

Should these be consistent between TableViewer and TreeViewer? And what should be the expected result?  (Perhaps you wouldn't want a selectAll to SetData on 1 million rows and that is the reason for using a virtual table in the first place (to only deal with rows that were viewed)?)
re comment #19: I have opened bug 128561 to track this.

Please open separate bugs for remaining problems with TreeViewer's virtual support.

There are EXPERIMENTAL tags on 3.2 final source code.

Is this API still EXPERIMENTAL?

No, it isn't.  Sorry for not taking out the tags.  The tags are no longer there in the 3.3 stream.

Note that the VIRTUAL support is not without bugs in 3.2 (for example bug 160738).  As of recent integration builds, the Debug views use TreeViewer and SWT.VIRTUAL and I am now more confident that it actually works (in the 3.3 stream).</WithStack>
