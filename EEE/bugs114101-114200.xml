Sinan, the stack trace may not be valid anymore since

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 110972 ***
The publish does work now.  However I am not able to start the IBM WebSphere v60 server.

Revisit serialized data using localized APIs. ICU4J adds specific unicode

Committed substitutions of JDK APIs with their ICU4J counterparts (e.g., StringTokenizer, Collator, etc.).

Remaining is to convert character-by-character iteration of strings with the ICU4J UCharacterIterator, StringSearch, etc. APIs.
Committed remaining changes to Query, Validation, and Transaction components for string manipulations using String.charAt(), searching, and case-insensitive comparison/searching.

OCL component still pending.
Completed the sweep in the OCL component, and undid some changes in the Validation component that were not necessary.

The ANTLR-generated OCL parser, itself, is unaffected as all of the OCL tokens that it searches for in parsing consist of ASCII characters.

    <WithOutStack>Build id: I20051025-0800

1) Open the apply patch wizard
2) Enter or select the name of a workspace patch
3) Click "Finish" without viewing any other page of the wizard.

-&gt; Nothing happens.

If I click Next before Finish, it works fine.
Shouldn't be hard to fix. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about this 
for M3 since Andre is away.

Profiler used: YourKit
Using various test models in both EMFT and clients of EMFT, I have been unable to reproduce such high times spent registering references. The biggest chunk of loading has always been the parsing of the file itself.

Could you retest and provide me with the test model and results of the test?
I re-ran the profiler on 7.0 and I'm not seeing the same results that I did on 6.0.1.1. The indexer is taking only 16% of the time now. Most of the time is being spent in the sax parser.

The only odd thing is that the overall in 7.0 is not better than in 6.0.1.1. So the extra time is being used up elsewhere. I will investigate further.
The original defect was against the MSL indexing mechanism. This does not seem to be the bottle neck anymore. Closing this bugzilla. A new one has to be opened depending on the investigation.

    <WithStack>For our language we had the notion of *.run files in our Windows IDE. These 
are the launch configurations in Eclipse, basically. This allowed us to do 
version control of these files, share them with people, use them in tutorials 
etc.

In Eclipse we lost this functionality. The launch configurations are 
persistent, but we have no control. It's not easy to create them in advance 
and share with people, have them in our CVS with the project, etc.

We would like to be able to plug a persistency mechanism for Launch 
Configurations. We would like to see defaults in the platform so that I can 
easily say "use a file-based persistency so that the file goes in the project 
of the file being launched". Every time our kind of launch config is created, 
a new file would be added to our project (*.run in our case). When I double-
click a *.run file I would like to see it open in the same editor as the 
launch config GUI (basically some platform-provided editor that is a wrapper 
around the launch config editor which I already implemented for that launch 
config GUI).

I would also like to define the actual syntax in the persistency file myself. 
I could use XML or CSV or a DB file using SQLITE etc, and the platform should 
not care. You just need an interface/API to talk to my persistency impl.

Thanks, --marcio
Not planned for 3.2. Note that you can save configs as files in the workspace via the Common tab of a launch config. This allows sharing configs with a team.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

Done.
FYI, accidentally checked in a change for 113422 under this defect number. The
change was to add the "Resolved bugzillas" link to the "Development Plans" web
page as per Tyler's email.
As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant enhancements/defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed. If this enhancement/defect is still unresolved and reproducible in the latest TPTP release (http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/), please re-open.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Over recent days, plugins in Eclipse WTP have been redesigned to work with 
facets. For example, the Web service scenarios now determine suitability of an 
existing project as the recipient of a Web service or client based on a 
comparison of the facets configured on the project and the facets required by 
the Web service or client. The facet subsystem provides a uniform, elegant 
means for expressing the capabilities of projects with respect to runtimes.

Facets are also new. In the Eclipse community of open source users and vendors 
there exist uncountable workspaces, archives and repositories with projects 
that do not have facets. These projects use a variety of techniques to describe 
their affinity to certain runtimes. For example, an Eclipse project equipped 
with a Java nature is understood to be a Java project.

It is essential that Eclipse WTP 1.0 be capable of quietly importing, checking 
out, or otherwise loading projects from "pre-WTP" workspaces and allow users to 
exploit all the tools in WTP that exploit or rely on facets, be it internally 
to the code or visibly to the user.

Obviously WTP can't know how to convert all the different kinds of projects out 
there (except perhaps the platform's own Java project), however, it does need 
to provide a means for extenders of the Eclipse platform to plug-in agents that:

1. Recognize their projects, analyze their particular runtime-configuration 
metadata, and compute a set of facets to accomplish the same configuration. 
Call this "facet simulation". The target project is not changed as a result of 
this process.

2. Configure and add the facets computed by [1] to the project. Call 
this "facet migration". The target project is changed as a result of this 
process. As an optional side-effect, a migration agent could also choose to 
dismantle the project's runtime-configuration metadata, rendering the project 
unusable with Eclipse-based platforms that predate or don't include WTP 1.0.

As a very cheap starting point, the Java framework might look something like 
this:

/**
* Provides a way to lookup Migrators for projects.
*/
public class ProjectFacetMigratorRegistry
{
  /**
  * Returns zero or more Migrators that recognize the given project.
  * Implementation does the work of processing the extension points.
  * PS: Or drop this class and stick the method on ProjectFacetsManager?
  */
  public IProjectFacetMigrator[] getProjectFacetMigrators ( IProject project );
}

/**
* A stateful migrator. That is, it has a bit of a lifecycle to it...
* getFacets(), isMigrationAllowed(), migrate, isCleanupAllowed, cleanup.
*/
public interface IProjectFacetMigrator
{
  /**
  * Returns the project this migrator is working on.
  */
  public IProject getProject ();

  /**
  * Returns the set of facets computed for the project.
  */
  public IProjectFacet[] getProjectFacets ();

  /**
  * Returns an IStatus indicating whether or not migration is allowed.
  * Status severity of less than ERROR means migration can proceed.
  * Status severity of ERROR means it can't.
  * Status text should explain why (eg. not supported, project read-only).
  */
  public IStatus readyToMigrate ();

  /**
  * Returns an IStatus indicating whether or not cleanup is allowed.
  * Status severity of less than ERROR means cleanup can proceed.
  * Status severity of ERROR means it can't.
  * Status text should explain why.
  */
  public IStatus readyToCleanup ();

  /**
  * Configures facets and applies them to the project, then
  * returns an IStatus indicating success or failure (and why).
  * Note: An intermediate base class could provide a vanilla
  * implementation of this method.
  * Precondition: readyToMigrate().getSeverity() != ERROR
  */
  public IStatus migrate ();

  /**
  * Cleans the project of any of its original runtime-configuration
  * data, presumably made unnecessary by facets.
  * Projects will not be backward compatible.
  * Precondition: readyToCleanup().getSeverity() != ERROR
  */
  public IStatus cleanup ();

  /**
  * Undoes migrate(). Where two or more migrators are found for a
  * given project, this is meant to provide a way for a framework
  * to roll back any completed migrators if one migrator in the set
  * fails to work.
  */
  public IStatus rollback ();
}

And an extension point might look something like this:

&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.migrators"&gt;
  &lt;migrator
    id="myMigrator"
    name="My Migrator"
    description="Migrates stuff"
    projectNatures="..."
    supportsMigration="true"
    supportsCleanup="false"
    class="MyInstanceOfProjectFacetMigrator"/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

Just some ideas to get things started.

Chuck,
I know you've been thinking quite a bit about migration, and this bug may just 
be the tip of the iceberg. Please feel welcome to revise the above, add in more 
requirements, etc.

Thanks - CB.
We have WTP 0.7 workspaces in a change control system that will be shared with
users of WTP 1.0. Also, we need to design tools on top of WTP that can handle
this mixed development environment. As it stands right now, this bugzilla 
describes an elegant way for us to migrate our tools to the facet world while 
still being able to handle the old workspaces and satisfying interoperability.
Just to be clear on expectations. I don't believe there are any plans to allow 
the use of WTP 0.7 projects in WTP 1.0 without converting said projects to the 
WTP 1.0 format.
I agree with the requirement for migrating old workspaces. Just a question - Is
the facet metadata stored in an easy-to-understand and easy-to-edit text format?
Where is this format defined?
I am converting the facets metadata into xml format. The schema is pretty easy, 
but is not documented because we shouldn't do anything to encourage people to 
edit this file by hand. 
Kosta, I think the schema should be documented for the sake of developers
extending that platform who need more information about facets. I don't think we
want to be in the businesss of hiding information.
I am confused as to why developers would need this. Why not go through the api 
that we provide? That file does not provide additional information that's not 
available through the api. We don't document internal classes, so why document 
internal file formats?
Kosta, if it's internal and is never meant to be touched by any code other than
the facets code, ok. I was responding to your comment that "we shouldn't do
anything to encourage people to edit this file by hand."

Will this document never need to be modified by hand? Is it used in project
migration? May some people need to edit it manually to migrate certain non-WTP
projects?
The file in question is serialized state of IFacetedProject. Any changes should 
go through that interface so that appropriate checks can be made. The 
likelyhood of someone being able to correctly modify this metadata by hand even 
if we publish the schema is very low. 

I am hoping that we don't intend to tell our users that in order to migrate non-
WTP projects over to WTP they need to create/modify half a dozen metadata files 
by hand. It seems unlikely than anyone would be able to create a functional 
project that way. They would be much better off by creating a new project and 
moving over the contents of the old.
I don't think we will get to something this extensive for 1.0. I believe the 
hard requirements for 1.0 are:

1. Upgrade (files are modified, not a simulation) of 0.7 projects to 1.0.
2. Allow straight java projects to be used wherever utility projects can 
currently be used. The java projects are not modified.
Just to let people know....  I plan on introducing a forward migration "action"
in this weeks build....  Not simulation - This could be activated automatically
as well.   but one step at a time.....

All 0.7 projects that map easily will have the appropriate facets added based on
the existing "component" metadata.

As we move forward to "simulated" facteted projects.  The same logic can be used
to introspect current projects, and add the appropriate "Virtual" facets... or
similar.....
Using this bug to track the forward migration: 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=110870
Lowering to P4 to indicate that facet simulation is not planned for 1.0. The 
0.7 to 1.0 migration has been split away into a separate bug.
Resolving this as WONTFIX as it is not clear that we need an elaborate facet simulation. As far as I understand it, the original core usecases are already handled.
Closed.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Over recent days, plugins in Eclipse WTP have been redesigned to work with 
facets. For example, the Web service scenarios now determine suitability of an 
existing project as the recipient of a Web service or client based on a 
comparison of the facets configured on the project and the facets required by 
the Web service or client. The facet subsystem provides a uniform, elegant 
means for expressing the capabilities of projects with respect to runtimes.

Facets are also new. In the Eclipse community of open source users and vendors 
there exist uncountable workspaces, archives and repositories with projects 
that do not have facets. These projects use a variety of techniques to describe

- Need to integrate this capability and persist it in the workspace.
Additional comments:
Partners need the ability to change the diagram editor toolbox to only have 
the items that their customers need.  To accomplish this, they will need to:

1. Remove toolbox items from existing tabs
2. Remove existing tabs
3. Add their own tabs
4. Add their own items to existing tabs or newly created tabs

This extensibility functionality will also be essential to OEM situations.

The persisted workspace settings may need to be sharable or configurable 
through API...
*** Bug 114217 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
IMHO would be nice to have it sooooooooooner
Reassigning to Cherie who has related paletted work in M6.
Steve, what do you mean by Comment #1?  Does this mean that they need to be able to do it before deploy time or just that items can be removed from the palette when the application is run like in the GEF logic example?
The expectation is that the workspace would be customized at runtime.  Then teams could export and share their workspace to other team members if they wished to reuse the customization.

I did some investigation of this and it looks like to persist the settings we merely need to implement the PaletteCustomizer interface and set it into the PaletteViewer customer.

Here's some code from the EDiagramEditor:
protected PaletteViewerProvider createPaletteViewerProvider() {
	return new PaletteViewerProvider(getEditDomain()) {
		protected void configurePaletteViewer(PaletteViewer viewer) {
			super.configurePaletteViewer(viewer);
			viewer.setCustomizer(new PaletteCustomizer() {
				public void revertToSaved() {}
				public void save() {}
			});
			viewer.addDragSourceListener(new TemplateTransferDragSourceListener(viewer));
		}
	};
}
Descoped officially from M6.  May still be considered if time permits and if the fix as mentioned below is low barrier.
I have hooked up this capability in GMF.  More specifically,
- I have extended the PaletteCustomizerDialog to remove the toolbar items which we will not support in GMF.  (We do not want to delete items as the user could never get them back and we have decided not to support reordering as it is questionable how this would be saved especially if capabilities are also adding/removing palette entries.)
- I have added the concept of an IPaletteState which saves the state of a palette entry.  This allows the PaletteCustomizer to revert the changes made in the Customize dialog if the user pressed Cancel (this did not work in GEF).
- I am storing the customizations made in the workspace preferences.

See the classes in the org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.gef.ui.palette.customize package for more details.

Note:  The saving of customizations does not currently work in GMF generated diagram editors because these editors do not have palette ids.  This feature requires palette ids as this is how the palette entry is identified in the workspace preferences.
[target cleanup] 2.1 M4 was the original target milestone for this bug
From this bug description I guess you mean customizing palette by editor users, who can right click on palette and choose "Customize..." button, yes?

Or is it possible to programatically customize palette for particular editor?
thanks

Debugging the code it appears that the anonymous is located using its name. This

instead.
isLocal() is no longer the problem.
Tobias, can you please investigate.
The AST node lookup has been fixed to return the AnonymousClassDeclaration node for EnumConstantDeclarations.
However the result after the rewriting is wrong. It seems that the ASTRewrite cannot handle deletions of anonymous class declarations for enum constants.

Also:
"And also it runs from runtime workbench of eclipse 3.2 "

and:
"
missed to add org.eclipse.core.commands_3.2.0.jar plugin which is required by jface.

added works fine now .... actually such an long message confused me :( .
"
It would be far less confusing if the dependency problems were reported in
bottom-up order, e.g. if it said first that org.eclipse.jface could not be
resolved because required bundle org.eclipse.core.commands was missing.

This is an issue every RCP developer encounters.

Fixed for M5.

The fix will only report missing leaf constraints.  The example in this defect should only log the require-bundle constraints for org.eclipse.core.commands since that is the leaf constraint causing the rest of the system to be unresolved.
I still think it's worth logging the fact that other bundles are disabled, as long as it's obvious what the root causes are.

The problem I have is that the log is still going to be pretty long which usually just causes the developer more confusion.  Perhaps if the message text is clear we can make two entries.  One which states:

One or more bundles are unresolved because the following root constraints are unresolved

And a second entry which states:

The following is a complete list of unresolved constraints in the system

This second list will be the complete list of unresolved bundles as we had before.
That sounds good.

Fixed in HEAD.  There are now two entries made to the log, one for the root constraints not resolved and one with the complete list.
Thanks Tom.
Tom, reporting these errors is nice, but it happens upon every startup and fills up my log.

is it possible to log such messages only when you have a new state (ie. a fresh install or when the cached state is stale)?
Maybe.  But my question is are you seeing this with a "nomral" launch of Eclipse or only when in dev-mode/self-hosting?  We should only be logging such messages when in dev-mode/self-hosting.
I am getting them in my runtime workbench, since I test with 1.4 VM and there is a couple of new plugins in the sdk with a J2SE-1.5 EE.

I haven't checked if it happens in the host as well. 

However, if it's only a runtime workbench thing, then current behaviour is fine.</WithStack>

In RCP newsgroup post: "Problem migrating RCP to eclipse 3.2", Yogesh K reports:

Hi,
We are migrating our RCP to eclipse 3.2 version and we get following message.
RCP works fine for eclipse 3.0.

Thanks for help in advance :) .

Also:
"And also it runs from runtime workbench of eclipse 3.2 "

and:
"
missed to add org.eclipse.core.commands_3.2.0.jar plugin which is required by jface.

added works fine now .... actually such an long message confused me :( .
"
It would be far less confusing if the dependency problems were reported in
bottom-up order, e.g. if it said first that org.eclipse.jface could not be
resolved because required bundle org.eclipse.core.commands was missing.

This is an issue every RCP developer encounters.

Fixed for M5.

The fix will only report missing leaf constraints.  The example in this defect should only log the require-bundle constraints for org.eclipse.core.commands since that is the leaf constraint causing the rest of the system to be unresolved.
I still think it's worth logging the fact that other bundles are disabled, as long as it's obvious what the root causes are.

The problem I have is that the log is still going to be pretty long which usually just causes the developer more confusion.  Perhaps if the message text is clear we can make two entries.  One which states:

One or more bundles are unresolved because the following root constraints are unresolved

And a second entry which states:

The following is a complete list of unresolved constraints in the system

This second list will be the complete list of unresolved bundles as we had before.
That sounds good.

Fixed in HEAD.  There are now two entries made to the log, one for the root constraints not resolved and one with the complete list.
Thanks Tom.
Tom, reporting these errors is nice, but it happens upon every startup and fills up my log.

is it possible to log such messages only when you have a new state (ie. a fresh install or when the cached state is stale)?
Maybe.  But my question is are you seeing this with a "nomral" launch of Eclipse or only when in dev-mode/self-hosting?  We should only be logging such messages when in dev-mode/self-hosting.
I am getting them in my runtime workbench, since I test with 1.4 VM and there is a couple of new plugins in the sdk with a J2SE-1.5 EE.

I haven't checked if it happens in the host as well. 

However, if it's only a runtime workbench thing, then current behaviour is fine.</WithOutStack>

It looks good to me with the following addition regarding the test assets section.

I think it maybe useful to add that the test assets are displayed without taking

From Bianca:
Only thing about Test log viewer is the verdict navigation enhancement has
already been delivered to 4.1.  I wouldn't put it in *future* category even
though 4.1 hasn't GA yet. Maybe this is a good time to provide some UX doc. for it. 

From Scott:
Looks good to me with the exception of one line.  The part in red needs to be
added or simply removing "from start" is sufficient as well.
-Scott

A test execution monitor view can:
·         Provide a progress monitor (including integration with Eclipse jobs to
display progress of test launch)
·         Display domain specific execution monitoring and control (of tests).
·         Provide monitoring and control of the entire test execution process
from start to finish
Web site document, Wayne sent doc to Ruth, Ruth to check in.
Done.

    <WithStack>Open the attached report created by choosing one of the New Report options. 
Look at the XML. Notice that the chart itslef takes about 750 lines out of a 
total of 950 lines of XML.

A general rule applied to the BIRT schema is that we don't serialize properties 
that take their default values. Since this is a default chart, it is surprising 
to see the large amount of text.

This large size will lead to problems with "diffing" two designs; something 
that is a key goal. it is also a large barrier to having third-party 
applications creating the XML, which is another goal.
This can't be properly fixed due to the XML schema of the chart, there are too 
many mandatory elements. Besides, the basic chart already has a lot of 
properties set, like the Axes, the Series and their Palettes (with a list of 
colors), etc...

We can provide some minor improvement by setting less values in the builder 
when creating the chart, but that would have almost no impact on the total size 
of the chart. I propose to defer the bug to investigate a possible solution.</WithStack>

Description:  In Chart dlg can't move to next screen or back to previous after 
changed number of Y Axes that cause lost the focus in the left pane in Data

Scenario:
1. Create a report contain a chart
2. Open Chart dialog and go to Data-&gt;X Axis -Set X Axis
3. Change number of Y Axes from 1 to 2
4. Click on &lt;Next&gt; (or &lt;Back&gt;) button
Result: can't move to next screen or back. 
You need to close and reopen Chart dialog or manualy set focus back in the left 
pane.

Note: the same issue occurred to move to next screen or back to previous after 
changed a value in "Number of Series Definitions" in "Data-&gt;Y Axis Set Y Axis 
Data".

Description:  Create a report with four charts. Decide to set a common font. 
Common colors. With anything else in BIRT, you can define a style. But, charts 
don't support styles, so one must manually set each chart and each property 
separately.

Expected charts to support styles since they are an inherent part of BIRT from 
the user's perspective.

Description:  Take the attached report, open it. Since the design is larger 
than a full screen, there is a vertical scroll bar on the right of the screen.

Scroll the scroll bar to the top. The click on the chart. Try to click the 
lowest point that you can see about the chart in the same screen. 

The report scrolls to the chart, very slowly. I suspect we are rendering the 
chart for every single move. 

In fact, since I am clicking on the same screen, there should not be scrolling 
at all in this case.  
   
   
Investigation Note   [5/25/2005 8:04:18 AM(Dmichonn)]:  
   
   After further investigation, I can see it is a little slower than scrolling 
for images. I found that the image painting takes about 15ms each time, while a 
regular image in the report is usually painted in 0ms. This could be linked to 
the way the swt image is created.

In any case, the performance is still perfectly acceptable.  
   
Comments   [5/24/2005 5:55:29 PM(whe)]:  
   
   I talked with Stanley. The current rendering performance is much better than 
it used to be. He is ok to leave with the current behaviour.

Since there is no funtion loss, I lower its serverity to 3, and suggest to 
defer to post BIRT 1.0  
   
Comments   [5/24/2005 2:44:42 PM(Dmichonn)]:  
   
   I can?t reproduce this issue. Is it still slow for you? The chart is 
repainting since it is moving, but using the same cached image, so no extra 
computation is performed. Please provide more details on how to reproduce and 
how slower it is than other report items like Images.
 
   
Investigation Note   [5/24/2005 9:49:27 AM(swang)]:  
   
   I can still easily reproduce.
The performance is acceptable now.

Description:  Description:
Set font rotation(not 90,0,-90) of X Axis Label,the Label's position is not in 
correct place.For more information please see attached file.  
   
   
comments   [6/22/2005 1:03:11 AM(zqian)]:  
   
   This need to change the rotation algorithm. leave to 2.0 .  
   
Comments   [5/25/2005 11:03:40 AM(Dmichonn)]:  
   
   I can reproduce it now. This depends on the data used in the report.

since it only happens for angles different than 0,90, -90, this can reasonably 
be deferred  
   
Comments   [5/23/2005 8:27:44 PM(jzhou)]:

   I can't reproduce this issue. Except the fact that it doesn't look nice for 
angles different that (0, 90, -90)in Layout view due to a SWT limitation, the 
position and orientation of the label is correct in layout and preview.

   This need to change the rotation algorithm. leave to 2.0 .  
   
Comments   [5/25/2005 11:03:40 AM(Dmichonn)]:  
   
   I can reproduce it now. This depends on the data used in the report.

since it only happens for angles different than 0,90, -90, this can reasonably 
be deferred

no code in the if clause for datetime grouping:

    <WithStack>I'm trying to create a faceted project and install the facets in 
the "template.jst.web" template into it. My understanding was that facet 
delegates should be able to handle the case where they their execute method is 
called with a null config object, i.e. I just want the the install delegate to 
use defaults. However, it looks like JavaFacetInstallDelegate, 
WebFacetInstallDelegate, EarFacetInstallDelegate, EjbFacetInstallDelegate, all 
assume a non-null config object. 

I'm setting this to a high severity because Web service wizards need to be able 
to perform automatic project creation for next week's 11/4 integration build 
and we're blocked on this function until this is resolved.
Adding information from conversion with Chuck...

The facets framework should support declaration of config factories in the core 
extension point. The framework can then detect when the user passes in null 
config and use the factory to create it. This way the user experience is 
unchanged (nulls are still allowed), but the delegates never have to check for 
null and create config themselves.
The fix has been released to HEAD. It should be in the i-builds shortly.
Which plugins do I need to pull in? I'm eager to try it out.
Quite a bit...

    <WithStack>A project I work on has an interesting layout that worked with eclipse 3.1 and webtools 0.7 but will not 
build with eclipse 3.1.1 and WebTools 0.7.1.

I get the following error:

Cannot nest '&lt;Project&gt;/&lt;pkg&gt;' inside '&lt;Project&gt;'.  To enable the nesting exclude '&lt;pkg&gt;/' from 
'&lt;Project&gt;'

Also, if I have Build Automatically turned on, the project continuously rebuilds.

The layout of the source is:

Project
    pkg
        class1.java
        class2.java
    src
        com
             foo
                 class3.java
                 class4.java

The legacy code is in pkg and class3.java and class4.java contain "import pkg.class1;" statements.

In eclipse 3.1, I was able to set up my build paths as follows:

&lt;classpath&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry including="pkg/" excluding="applets/|applets_src/|src/|webapps/|testtools_src/" 
kind="src" path=""/&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry output=".deployables/nbbs/WEB-INF/classes" kind="src" path="src"/&gt;
	&lt;classpathentry kind="output" path="webapps/nbbs/WEB-INF/classes"/&gt;
.....
&lt;/classpath&gt;

This allowed the source in pkg to be built with the correct package references (import pkg.class1; for 
example.)

I have not tried upgrading eclipse 3.1 to 3.1.1 while leaving webtools at 0.7, or upgrading webtools to 
0.7.1 while leaving eclipse at 3.1.
I was able to work around this by commenting out the wb-resource for pkg in
.wtpmodules.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project-modules id="moduleCoreId"&gt;
    &lt;wb-module deploy-name="app"&gt;
        &lt;module-type module-type-id="jst.web"&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.4&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;property name="context-root" value="app"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="java-output-path" value="/bin/"/&gt;
        &lt;/module-type&gt;
        &lt;wb-resource source-path="/webapps/app" deploy-path="/"/&gt;
        &lt;wb-resource source-path="/src" deploy-path="/WEB-INF/classes"/&gt;
&lt;!--        &lt;wb-resource source-path="/pkg" deploy-path="/WEB-INF/classes"/&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;/wb-module&gt;
&lt;/project-modules&gt;
Feels like a webtooling issue, we haven't changed the classpath rules in Java in
between 3.1.0 and 3.1.1
I believe the problem here is the addition of the 2nd source folder mapped to
the same deploy path.  In that level, we only picked up one of the folders,
which is why the workaround seems to work.  This should be fixed in the M9 WTP
integration drivers.
This bug is being moved to the "closed" state since it has been in the fixed state for a so long it is being assumed fixed, without explicit verification from the originator. If there is still a problem, in the most recent 1.5.x builds, please reopen or open another bug.</WithStack>

example.)

I have not tried upgrading eclipse 3.1 to 3.1.1 while leaving webtools at 0.7, or upgrading webtools to 
0.7.1 while leaving eclipse at 3.1.
I was able to work around this by commenting out the wb-resource for pkg in
.wtpmodules.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project-modules id="moduleCoreId"&gt;
    &lt;wb-module deploy-name="app"&gt;
        &lt;module-type module-type-id="jst.web"&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.4&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;property name="context-root" value="app"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="java-output-path" value="/bin/"/&gt;
        &lt;/module-type&gt;
        &lt;wb-resource source-path="/webapps/app" deploy-path="/"/&gt;
        &lt;wb-resource source-path="/src" deploy-path="/WEB-INF/classes"/&gt;
&lt;!--        &lt;wb-resource source-path="/pkg" deploy-path="/WEB-INF/classes"/&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;/wb-module&gt;
&lt;/project-modules&gt;
Feels like a webtooling issue, we haven't changed the classpath rules in Java in
between 3.1.0 and 3.1.1
I believe the problem here is the addition of the 2nd source folder mapped to
the same deploy path.  In that level, we only picked up one of the folders,
which is why the workaround seems to work.  This should be fixed in the M9 WTP
integration drivers.
This bug is being moved to the "closed" state since it has been in the fixed state for a so long it is being assumed fixed, without explicit verification from the originator. If there is still a problem, in the most recent 1.5.x builds, please reopen or open another bug.</WithOutStack>

a java project with a src folder
the file in question is foo/bin/A.class
where foo is not on the classpath and none of its subdirs is either.
you click on the classfile and you see an error message box. 
You close it but another one appears and so for like 25 times (one per action).
Here's a stack trace

Moving to JDT/Core. The interesting question here is why the file is provided as
a class file by JDT/Core in the first place. As far as I know we only have
support for compilation units not being on the build path.
This works for me with I20051102-0010.
Please reopen if you have more details.
Created attachment 33438
project

reopening - I see the bug again on Build id: I20051215-1506

attached is the project. 
after adding the project, select the file debug/graph.Graph.class in the package explorer.

&gt; The interesting question here is why the file is provided as
&gt; a class file by JDT/Core in the first place. As far as I know we only have
&gt; support for compilation units not being on the build path.
.class file outside the classpath are also supported. Actually if we returned null  for JavaCore.create(IResource) for a .class file outside the classpath, this would throw an exception in the class file editor.
The problem here is not that the .class file is outside the classpath, but rather that it is not a valid .class file name (extra dot before the .class extension).

Simple fix would be to remove 
  Assert.isTrue(name.indexOf('.') == -1);
as it looks like we behave correctly with such a .class file name.
Removed assertion and added regression test ClassFileTests#testDotName()

the file in question is foo/bin/A.class
where foo is not on the classpath and none of its subdirs is either.
you click on the classfile and you see an error message box. 
You close it but another one appears and so for like 25 times (one per action).

    <WithStack>When using an IDebugModelPresentation, the images and highlights applied to 
the source file to indicate the currently executing line are not removed when 
the debug target is terminated and completes execution. In other words, there 
is no call made to RemoveAnnotations corresponding to the one made to 
AddAnnotations.
Looking at the code, the call to removeAnnotations(...) is made when a TERMINTE or RESUME event is fired from the target or thread. Do you have an example where this is failing?
I can reproduce the problem consistently in our IDE, but it's alot of code. So I'll start with what I hope are the salient parts.

public class PrologDebugModelPresentation extends LabelProvider implements IDebugModelPresentation, IDebugEditorPresentation {
...
	public boolean addAnnotations(IEditorPart editorPart, IStackFrame stackFrame) {
		int charStart, length;
		Position position;
		PrologStackFrame prologFrame;
		
		if (!(editorPart instanceof TextEditor)) return false;
		if (stackFrame instanceof PrologStackFrame) {
			prologFrame = (PrologStackFrame)stackFrame;
			TextEditor textEditor = (TextEditor)editorPart;
			IDocumentProvider docProvider = textEditor.getDocumentProvider();
			IEditorInput editorInput = textEditor.getEditorInput();

			// Create the Position object that specifies a location for the annotation
			IDocument doc = docProvider.getDocument(editorInput);
			if (doc == null) {
				return false;
			}
			try {
				int lineNumber = stackFrame.getLineNumber() - 1;
				IRegion region = doc.getLineInformation(lineNumber);
				charStart = region.getOffset();
				length = region.getLength();
			} catch (BadLocationException ble) {
				return false;
			} catch (DebugException de) {
				return false;
			}
			position = new Position(charStart, length);
			textEditor.selectAndReveal(charStart, 0);
				
			// If there is no annotation model, there's nothing more to do
			annotationModel = docProvider.getAnnotationModel(editorInput);
			if (annotationModel == null) {
				return false;
			}
			
			// Create the annotation object
			String port = prologFrame.getPort().toLowerCase().trim();
			ip = new Annotation("com.amzi.prolog.debug.ui."+port+"IP", false, "call");

			// Add the annotation at the position to the editor's annotation model.
			annotationModel.addAnnotation(ip, position);
			annotations.add(ip);
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}

	public void removeAnnotations(IEditorPart editorPart, IThread thread) {
	    for (Iterator i = annotations.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
			annotationModel.removeAnnotation((Annotation) i.next());
	    	i.remove();
	    }
	}

and in the DebugTarget:

		if (action.equals(TERMINATE)) {
			event = new DebugEvent(this, DebugEvent.TERMINATE, DebugEvent.CLIENT_REQUEST);
			terminated = true;
		}
		if (event != null) {
			DebugEvent events[] = { event };
			DebugPlugin.getDefault().fireDebugEventSet(events);
		}

When I use the PDE debugger, addAnnotations is called properly. However, removeAnnotations is not called after the TERMINATE event is fired from the DebugTarget per the above code.

If this does not clarify the problem, please let me know what you would like next. I can send the entire IDE, or you can download the runtime version of it. Or I can email specific source files.

This works for me in 3.2, i.e. if the TERMINATE event is only fired from the target and not its threads. Will test in 3.1.1.
Also works for me in 3.1.1:

To test, I changed the JDIModelPresentation to implement IDebugEditorPresentation as follows:

public boolean addAnnotations(IEditorPart editorPart, IStackFrame frame) {
	System.out.println("ADD ANNOTATIONS");
	return true;
}

public void removeAnnotations(IEditorPart editorPart, IThread thread) {
	System.out.println("REMOVE ANNOTATIONS");
}

I modified the JDIThread to never fire terminate events (only the target). This is the trace of events and add/remove annotations. I debug to a breakpoint and the terminate the target:

Here's our specific case (under 3.1.1). We have a PrologDebugTarget that runs a Prolog-language interpreter in its own view (PrologListenerView). The view runs the Prolog interpreter in its own separate thread (PrologListener). The PrologListener calls terminate in PrologDebugTarget when it receives a terminate action.

The actual terminate call comes from our Prolog engine written in C++ as a .dll or .so. The Prolog engine is calling a method in Java (via the JNI) to fire the terminate event.

Is there some code I can run on my side to help isolate the problem?

Can you verify that LaunchView.clearSourceSelection(Object) is being called when your debug target fires a terminate event? If so, follow it through to see what happens.
LaunchView.clearSourceSelection() is not called on terminate (it is called at each single step). 
Here's how I fire the terminate:
event = new DebugEvent(this, DebugEvent.TERMINATE, debugEvent.CLIENT_REQUEST);
DebugEvent events[] = { event };
DebugPlugin.getDefault().fireDebugEventSet(events);
After walking through the above code it never calls clearSourceSelection().
Is the Debug view open/visible when the terminate event is fired? Does the event get picked up by the LaunchViewEventHandler.doHandleDebugEvents(...) method? Is the event filtered somehow - perhaps by LaunchViewEventHandler.filterEvents(...)?
The Debug View is open.

FilterEvents returns EMPTY_EVENT_SET because this is false:
DebugPlugin.getDefault().getLaunchManager().isRegistered(launch)

And, that fails because I remove the launch in the terminate code. Obviously that's not the right place to do that. Where should it be done?

Thanks for all your help!
Correct - we do not process events for non-registered launches, as they are not visible, and may be "private"/have no effect on the UI.

Why do you remove the launch programatically? Why not let the user do it, or let the launch be removed via the preference to "remove terminated launches when a new launch is created"?

There is no "great" way to ensure that the event has been handled by all listeners before you remove the launch. Event notification/handling is performed in a seperate thread than the "fire" call. As a hack, you could register an event listener to remove the launch, assuming it will be called after the debug view gets a chance to process the event (but there are no API specs that guarentee this behavior).

Marking works for me.
You could try DebugPlugin.asyncExec(Runnable). Submit a runnable to be executed after event dispatch.
I'll let the user remove them. I believe this code dates back to an earlier version where that preference did not exist, or I was unaware of it. (We've been using Eclipse since 2.0).

Thanks again for your help. I never would have found it otherwise. Hopefully others will find this log here useful.</WithStack>

Testsuites, testcases and required files were committed org.eclipse.tptp.monitoring.tests plugin in TPTP Head CVS.

Note, all of the Monitor.Analysis.LogImport.* testsuites were automated except Monitor.Analysis.LogImport_Windows_Event_Logs.  That testsuite will be automated with defect https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=141860.

    <WithStack>I am using Rational Performance Tester (RPT) 6.1.2 and Eclipse 3.0.2 on a pc
with 1 GB RAM running Windows XP.

Executing a test schedule, RPT encountered out of memory condition.
Eclipse popped up error box informing me of the problem and recommending
invocation of workbench with -vmargs -Xmx, and then asked if I wanted to quit. 
I noticed the Eclipse UI was not running, but the eclipse.exe and javaw.exe
processes were running.
I clicked "No" to quitting, but the UI did not come back up.
Either the RPT plugin should have ended cleanly and the user not prompted for
whether to quit, or the plugin should have remained functional.

When I then attempted to re-invoke RPT, I got this error:

"Workspace in use, choose a different one."
Can you attach your log file if available (workspace/.metadata/.log).
Created attachment 28949
The problem occurred on Oct 28, 2005, while opening performance reports with Rational Performance Tester.
I don't see any Eclipse-specific problems in the log... If you get this
repeatedly, I suggest running with a larger VM heap size using the -Xmx command
line argument.  When the VM runs out of memory there is not much that can be
done to recover.</WithStack>

The symptoms suggest that the class file is either corrupted or not a valid 
Java class. Can you confirm which version and build of AspectJ you are using? 
Could you attach an example of a file that causes this failure.
I am usaing version 1.2.1, the latest stable release.  I don't know the build
number.  Sorry, I can't give you the file that causes the problem. But it's
possible that the file is corrupted.  However, it's still very useful to have
ajc skip the corrupted file.  
Created attachment 30247
file that causes ajcore dump
Created attachment 30248
file that causes ajcore dump
I actually have two example files for you that causes ajcoredump
Both attachments appear to be valid JDK 1.2 (major_version = 46) but corrupted class files: javap fails with the same error as AspectJ: invalid constant type: 108. Therefor I don't think this is an AspectJ bug. How are these classes being generated?

Recent versions of AspectJ produce a more meaningful exception message containing the name of the corrupted file. A further enhancement could be made so that an error message is issued. The compiler would then continue through the remaining files allowing you to determine which are corrupted but no byte-code would be generated. 

In general it is unsafe to produce a partially woven application e.g javac will not generate class files if errors are found. Might I suggest using Ant to copy those files known to be valid (using includ/exclude filters) to a temporary directory and then use iajc to weave them.
I agreed with you that the file is corrupted, so it's not really a bug of ajc.  I mentioned earlier that I am applying aspectJ to the legacy binary code, it's a very useful enhancement that if it fails on one binary file, it will move on to the rest.  I think the user can decide if it's safe or not to use partially woven application.  This enhancement can broaden what aspectJ can do.  

I get those two examples files from weblogic example code.   
If you pass invalid or corrupt byte-code to AspectJ we will issue and error. If any errors are issued during weaving we will not generate any byte-code e.g. the file specified using -outjar will not exist. This is because in general the resulting woven byte-code will not be a valid program and will not behave as the user desires. If a bug is reported it may be very difficult for the AspectJ team to find out what's wrong.

I agree that normal behavior of aspectJ should just fail and stop weaving.  But could we have a option that force it continue even though it encounted corrupted file?  (Like ant, you can set something like fail-on-error to false, to force it to continue) 
The use of a "proceedOnError" option with certain tools may produce output whose incompleteness can easily be determined i.e. file missing, ClassNotFoundException. With AspectJ the failure to apply cross-cutting function completely can produce far more subtle failures which are very difficult to diagnose especially if the original build messages are not available. A ClassFormatException is a rare and serious problem and if the code had been generated by AspectJ itself we would want to know as soon as possible.

Over the next week I propose to share the work in progress with the rest of the project. When complete you will need to follow these steps in the specified order:

1. Take a fresh AspectJ workspace in Eclipse 3.2 
2. Install JDK 1.5, JDK 1.3 and CDC 1.0/J2ME Foundation 1.0 using the Eclipse Wiki http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Execution_Environments (or get a copy from me).
3. Associate the CDC-1.0, JSE-1.3 and JSE-1.5 Execution Environments with the appropriate JDKs (to avoid build warnings) using  the "Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; Java &gt; Installed JREs &gt; Execution Environments" page. 
4. Add an "ASPETCTJ_WORKSPACE" Path Variable that identifies the workspace e.g."C:\workspaces\org.aspectj-Restructure" using the "Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; General &gt; Workspace &gt; Linked Resources" preference page. 
5. Check out all the new plug-in projects (exact location to be decided).

Don't worry about the "The resource is a duplicate of ..." warnings which are cause by using linked source folders. Run "RunTheseBeforeYouCommitTests" in org.aspectj.all.tests as a "JUnit Test" (no need to use "JUnit Plug-in Test") using JDK 1.5 (it will use 1.3 by default). I will need to move some tests from 1.3 to 1.5 because they currently have hidden dependencies. You should be able to develop and test in the new structure then commit using the old (after a refresh of those projects). The names are a little long and may not be easy to distinguish but they are unique and you can always use "Check Out As...".

To work with the new bundle projects (unless changing dependencies or adding new projects):
1. Synchronize the old projects with HEAD
2. Refresh (and build) the new projects
3. Run org.aspectj.all.tests
4. Make changes to code in the new projects
5. When adding a test you will need to use the old project to add or modify data e.g. (because there are no linked folders)
6. Run org.aspectj.all.tests
7. Refresh the old projects
8. Synchronize the old projects with HEAD

The basic structure is:

	org.aspectj.ajde &gt; org.aspectj.core &gt; org.aspectj.weaver &gt; org.aspectj.runtime

The org.aspectj.weaver module contains asm, bridge, loadtime, util and weaver. To make things easier each project re-exports its public dependencies. In addition there are fragments to hold code with a Java dependency that are automatically loaded with their host when using Java 5 e.g. runtime5 &gt; runtime. Finally each bundle has an accompany tests bundle while org.aspectj.tests contains the compiler tests.

Project dependencies (.classpath) are replaced by bundle dependencies (META-INF/manifest.mf). In addition a bundle must be explicit about which packages other bundles can see i.e. its interface must be explicitly exported. There are 3 basic types of dependency:
1. Require-Bundle:	Used when a bundle has a hard dependency on another specific bundle implementation e.g. weaver and runtime or weaver.tests and weaver.
2. Import-Package:	Used when a dependency is provided by a different bundle during development than when it is deployed e.g. XML. The dependency can be optional as in the case of JRockit.
3. Bundle-Host:		Used for JRE-specific features. The fragment is logically part of the host bundle but is only loaded if its requirements are met. This allows weaver.tests to have a hard dependency on weaver but only when run with Java 5 is the weaver5 bundle loaded.

The main advantages of this approach are:
1. The project looks like what we ship and so AJDT can consume AspectJ directly from head (so can the Aspects Equinox Incubator and any other Eclipse/OSGi-based project).
2. Better management of dependencies such as Java 5, XML and JRockit.

    <WithOutStack>I encounter problems when I try to run ajc on  a jar file or a diretory of
files, once ajc crash on one file, it completetly dies.  It will be useful that
ajc can continue run on the rest of the files.
Can you give some details of how ajc "crashes". Do you get an exception or an 
error message.
It generates ajcore dump.

--- Dump Properties ---

Dump file: ajcore.20051116.114233.674.txt

Dump reason: org.aspectj.apache.bcel.classfile.ClassFormatException

Dump on exception: true

Dump at exit condition: abort

---- Exception Information ---



The symptoms suggest that the class file is either corrupted or not a valid 
Java class. Can you confirm which version and build of AspectJ you are using? 
Could you attach an example of a file that causes this failure.
I am usaing version 1.2.1, the latest stable release.  I don't know the build
number.  Sorry, I can't give you the file that causes the problem. But it's
possible that the file is corrupted.  However, it's still very useful to have
ajc skip the corrupted file.  
Created attachment 30247
file that causes ajcore dump
Created attachment 30248
file that causes ajcore dump
I actually have two example files for you that causes ajcoredump
Both attachments appear to be valid JDK 1.2 (major_version = 46) but corrupted class files: javap fails with the same error as AspectJ: invalid constant type: 108. Therefor I don't think this is an AspectJ bug. How are these classes being generated?

Recent versions of AspectJ produce a more meaningful exception message containing the name of the corrupted file. A further enhancement could be made so that an error message is issued. The compiler would then continue through the remaining files allowing you to determine which are corrupted but no byte-code would be generated. 

In general it is unsafe to produce a partially woven application e.g javac will not generate class files if errors are found. Might I suggest using Ant to copy those files known to be valid (using includ/exclude filters) to a temporary directory and then use iajc to weave them.
I agreed with you that the file is corrupted, so it's not really a bug of ajc.  I mentioned earlier that I am applying aspectJ to the legacy binary code, it's a very useful enhancement that if it fails on one binary file, it will move on to the rest.  I think the user can decide if it's safe or not to use partially woven application.  This enhancement can broaden what aspectJ can do.  

I get those two examples files from weblogic example code.   
If you pass invalid or corrupt byte-code to AspectJ we will issue and error. If any errors are issued during weaving we will not generate any byte-code e.g. the file specified using -outjar will not exist. This is because in general the resulting woven byte-code will not be a valid program and will not behave as the user desires. If a bug is reported it may be very difficult for the AspectJ team to find out what's wrong.

I agree that normal behavior of aspectJ should just fail and stop weaving.  But could we have a option that force it continue even though it encounted corrupted file?  (Like ant, you can set something like fail-on-error to false, to force it to continue) 
The use of a "proceedOnError" option with certain tools may produce output whose incompleteness can easily be determined i.e. file missing, ClassNotFoundException. With AspectJ the failure to apply cross-cutting function completely can produce far more subtle failures which are very difficult to diagnose especially if the original build messages are not available. A ClassFormatException is a rare and serious problem and if the code had been generated by AspectJ itself we would want to know as soon as possible.

Over the next week I propose to share the work in progress with the rest of the project. When complete you will need to follow these steps in the specified order:

1. Take a fresh AspectJ workspace in Eclipse 3.2 
2. Install JDK 1.5, JDK 1.3 and CDC 1.0/J2ME Foundation 1.0 using the Eclipse Wiki http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Execution_Environments (or get a copy from me).
3. Associate the CDC-1.0, JSE-1.3 and JSE-1.5 Execution Environments with the appropriate JDKs (to avoid build warnings) using  the "Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; Java &gt; Installed JREs &gt; Execution Environments" page. 
4. Add an "ASPETCTJ_WORKSPACE" Path Variable that identifies the workspace e.g."C:\workspaces\org.aspectj-Restructure" using the "Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; General &gt; Workspace &gt; Linked Resources" preference page. 
5. Check out all the new plug-in projects (exact location to be decided).

Don't worry about the "The resource is a duplicate of ..." warnings which are cause by using linked source folders. Run "RunTheseBeforeYouCommitTests" in org.aspectj.all.tests as a "JUnit Test" (no need to use "JUnit Plug-in Test") using JDK 1.5 (it will use 1.3 by default). I will need to move some tests from 1.3 to 1.5 because they currently have hidden dependencies. You should be able to develop and test in the new structure then commit using the old (after a refresh of those projects). The names are a little long and may not be easy to distinguish but they are unique and you can always use "Check Out As...".

To work with the new bundle projects (unless changing dependencies or adding new projects):
1. Synchronize the old projects with HEAD
2. Refresh (and build) the new projects
3. Run org.aspectj.all.tests
4. Make changes to code in the new projects
5. When adding a test you will need to use the old project to add or modify data e.g. (because there are no linked folders)
6. Run org.aspectj.all.tests
7. Refresh the old projects
8. Synchronize the old projects with HEAD

The basic structure is:

	org.aspectj.ajde &gt; org.aspectj.core &gt; org.aspectj.weaver &gt; org.aspectj.runtime

The org.aspectj.weaver module contains asm, bridge, loadtime, util and weaver. To make things easier each project re-exports its public dependencies. In addition there are fragments to hold code with a Java dependency that are automatically loaded with their host when using Java 5 e.g. runtime5 &gt; runtime. Finally each bundle has an accompany tests bundle while org.aspectj.tests contains the compiler tests.

Project dependencies (.classpath) are replaced by bundle dependencies (META-INF/manifest.mf). In addition a bundle must be explicit about which packages other bundles can see i.e. its interface must be explicitly exported. There are 3 basic types of dependency:
1. Require-Bundle:	Used when a bundle has a hard dependency on another specific bundle implementation e.g. weaver and runtime or weaver.tests and weaver.
2. Import-Package:	Used when a dependency is provided by a different bundle during development than when it is deployed e.g. XML. The dependency can be optional as in the case of JRockit.
3. Bundle-Host:		Used for JRE-specific features. The fragment is logically part of the host bundle but is only loaded if its requirements are met. This allows weaver.tests to have a hard dependency on weaver but only when run with Java 5 is the weaver5 bundle loaded.

The main advantages of this approach are:
1. The project looks like what we ship and so AJDT can consume AspectJ directly from head (so can the Aspects Equinox Incubator and any other Eclipse/OSGi-based project).
2. Better management of dependencies such as Java 5, XML and JRockit.

    <WithStack>Currently, there are only two options to run ajc on binary files, either a jar
file or a directory.  Sometimes I need to run ajc on a single binary file in a
directory, but since that directory have other files, ajc will apply the other
files too.  If there is a option to run ajc on a single binary file, it will be
very useful.
Have you tried refining your pointcut e.g. "&amp;&amp; within(org.myorg.myclass)"?
The reason I want to run it on single file is that when ajc crushes on a file in
the directory, it will stop injecting other files.  I am working on the legacy
binary apps, where ahead of time, I have no knowledge about which file will fail
ajc and need to skip.  So I have to programmatically run ajc on each file in a
directory, and so that if ajc fails on one file, my program can continue run ajc
on other files.   If when ajc crashes on one file, it can still continue on
other files, it will solve my problem too.
This is a request for a workaround to bug 114146.

    <WithStack>Using the latest WTP M8 patches, I am unable to import the WebSphere trade EAR 
file. I will attach the EAR.
The EAR is too big to attach. I will send it to Chuck Bridgham. The problem is 
that the import EAR wizard never lets me click Finish. It is always disabled.
Apparently, programmatic export of the EAR also drags in .deployables which 
contains another TradeEJB.jar. However, the classes in the .deployables vs. 
the root versions are different. Could it be that the EAR is corrupted and the 
TradeEJB.jar is actually not complete in its assembly with pieces still 
in .deployables.
Jason, as discussed, the real problem that we need addressed is the one where
exporting after ejbdeploy results in the EJB module being corrupted. Some of
the classes are in TradeEJB.jar while others are in .deployables/TradeEJB.jar. 
There shouldn't be any .deployables in the exported EAR and TradeEJB.jar 
should be complete.
leaving this open for M9, but with a slightly different problem.

Using trade.ear as an example (which has EJAJar with *.class files)  an
"imported_classes.jar" is added to the EJB Project.   The contents of this jar
is not included on export.   This is occuring for WAR's as well
Neeraj - Assigning this to you, just need to make sure the contents of
"imported_jars" is included.  Ask Jason for some pointers

Fixed the problem as mentioned by Chuck in the comment# 5
This ia part of a mass update, marking fixed blockers older than 6 months as automatically verified (the logic being it must be fixed or we sure would have heard about it!) As always, feel free to re-open if not fixed!

ie.

The problem I encounter when I do this is that the final zip contains the

In another scenario, I've also discovered that binary plug-ins are also 
included.  I will try to create a test case to reproduce.
Do you have more details on how to reproduce this?
Will try to get something for you today if I can reproduce with some existing 
eclipse platform features.
Andrew, can you follow up with Releng and see if this is still a problem, how critical, ...
This remains an issue - not critical at this point in that I can work around using PDE Build packager to repackage.

Extract the zip to a directory and modify the build.bat file to point to your eclipse install.  Double click to run (~10 secs to complete).

1.  I.build\a.feature.sdk.zip contains a.feature_1.0.0
2.  a.plugin_1.0.0.jar is built incorrectly.

Problem is that features/plugins encountered during source generation are added to the assembly info regardless of whether or not the feature is being included in the build.  Attached is proposed path that needs more testing before being applied.
Note that there is another bug here.  The a.feature.sdk feature will not be able to be built in isolation, this will only work when a.feature is also built.  See bug 159152
patch released to HEAD</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I am trying to generate a stand-alone drop of a source feature and it's plug-
ins using the generate.feature build.property setting:

ie.
generate.feature@org.eclipse.pde.source=org.eclipse.pde

The problem I encounter when I do this is that the final zip contains the 
org.eclipse.pde feature directory.
In another scenario, I've also discovered that binary plug-ins are also 
included.  I will try to create a test case to reproduce.
Do you have more details on how to reproduce this?
Will try to get something for you today if I can reproduce with some existing 
eclipse platform features.
Andrew, can you follow up with Releng and see if this is still a problem, how critical, ...
This remains an issue - not critical at this point in that I can work around using PDE Build packager to repackage.

Reassign to 4.2 iteration 3. Did not get in iteration 2.
This is something we need, however there are more severe defect that are higher in the queue for 4.2.  I am retarget to 4.2 iteration 4 for now, but realistically it probably won't get accomplished in 4.2. 
I plan on deferring this to 4.4 unless I hear otherwise.  We will also need to get someone from Test.UI to improve logging.
Defer to 4.4 . 
Add estimate.
Targeting to future since not containable in 4.4.
As discussed on this week's Test Project call (January 22, 2007), the Test Project will focus on existing P1 - P2/Blocker - Major and P1/Normal and test creation/automation defects (omitting defects dependant on outstanding features) in TPTP 4.4.

Markus, 

one idea is that we leverage the new content type support added in 3.1 here and
allow these changes only in extensions that have text content. What do you think ?
As of build &gt; I20051122-0800, this exception will no longer happen but the displayed content will probably be useless. I suggest to only process files if TextFileBufferManager.isTextFileLocation(IPath, false) returns 'true'.
*** Bug 100051 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Fixed in HEAD according to comments 1 and 2.

We don't change non-text files any more (although it would work now with the fix for bug 116034, but it still doesn't make sense). The checkbox now tells that qualified names are only updated in non-Java *text* files.

Note: bug 100051 was not a dup.

    <WithStack>THE PROBLEM:

Views may need to set or clear their busy state without running a job. This
enhancement requests new API on IWorkbenchSiteProgressService to control the
busy state.


MY USE CASE:

In my plugin, most of my jobs are managed by a headless component. The views get
notified when their model is being (re)computed, but they don't need to schedule
their own jobs or threads.

Currently, views can only indicate that they are busy by scheduling a Job
through IWorkbenchSiteProgressService. This means that I need to schedule a job
that does nothing but block as long as I want the view to look busy.

This is complicated and inefficient.


ONE SUGGESTED SOLUTION:

Add the following method to IWorkbenchSiteProgressService:

/**
 * Creates a progress monitor that can be used to report progress
 * in the part. Calling this method will cause the part to be considered
 * busy. The part will be considered busy until IProgressMonitor.done()
 * is called.
 *
 * @return a newly created progress monitor. Never null. The caller 
 * is responsible for calling IProgressMonitor.done() when they are
 * done with the progress monitor.
 * 
 **/
IProgressMonitor createProgressMonitor();
Michael, this is the PR we discussed.
Another possible solution:

/**

 * The view will be given the busy appearance if
 * the number of calls to setBusy(true) is greater
 * than the number of calls to setBusy(false)

    <WithStack>I've found that a common feature that users ask for is to have support in
recording and playing back test cases in an RCP application.

The general dependence of the test framework on the IDE environment has to be
investigated.  Based on this investigation, further enhancements may need to be
opened to eliminate some of the test components dependence on the IDE environment.

Users may not get the full advantage of the test framework in an IDE environment
but they should generally be given a fairly consistent user interface to record
and playback test cases.

Both RCP and stand-alone SWT applications would be beneficial.
Could this technology be used for general record/playback ("macros") in Eclipse, like in bug 8519?

&gt; Could this technology be used for general record/playback ("macros") in
&gt; Eclipse, like in bug 8519?

Hi,I don't think this new feature can only be used in Eclipse frameword.We really hope this feature can support us in not only Eclipse,but also some other Application Framework such as IE and Mozela.Thanks ! I really hope more people will vote for it!
proposed to be planned for 4.2 but no resources are available (helpwanted keyword added)

Target set to 4.2
Hi My company has a RCP application that would benefit greatly from this product enhancement.  The tool looks good and I can't wait to use and have my developers use verification hooks to test new UI features.

Thanks,

At the moment, we are using WindowTester where I work:

http://www.instantiations.com/rcpdeveloper/index.html

Would fixing this bug result in functionnality similar to that commercial product?

We have had some amount of success but it is a bit painful and does not track every event at the moment.  

We also don't just record entire "acceptance tests" for the application but unit test each dialog which is more useful because there is too much setup otherwise - the test becomes too complicated.
Since JFace apps are mostly based on actions, adding a recording API to Action might already get some way where we need to be.

I mean, there is no need to actually click the buttons (determining their position, sending mouse events, etc).

I'm thinking about something like the Java logging API or maybe even (ab-)using the logging API to record events.

But we would need to spread Action everywhere (for example, into Dialog und subclasses).

The next step would be to add this API to all the SWT classes like Text, StyledText, Tree, etc, so they could record events.

Based on feedback from our EclipseWorld 2006 TPTP Automated Services Framework talk -- RCP support was stressed as very important from our students.
As part of this bug I would like a way of simulating mouse and keyboard events within test cases. Both as part of automated acceptance tests but also part of rolling some GUI testing into my unit tests.
Can I expect this feature in next release of TPTP
Whether the Scirpt recorded for GUI test case can be integrated with the URL test script,that is to say, we can test the URL command and IE interface(GUI object) in the same test case. Not sure whether the execution mechanisms of GUI test and URL test,can anyone help to explain it to me? Thanks.

In TPTP, you currently cannot mix test types (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123277).

We are still working through the TPTP 4.4 planning cycle (http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/tptp-pmc/msg02658.html) but this feature is one of the higher priority features for 4.4 since TPTP needs to automated our RCP Log Analyzer and RCP Symptom Database Editor.  However, including this feature is a question of resources which we are still in the process of planning.  

Would you or CA be interested in contributing resources for this feature?


Hi Paul,

I have discussed your query with the management team over here.
I am unhappy to say at this point of time me or CA will not be able to contribute towards this feature.
Updating target to future as requested by the PMC.  

Enhancements are targeted to future if not in plan for the current release.
Reassigning to current component lead.
Correcting priority since not a 4.5 candidate enhancement (see http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/documents/process/development/bugzilla.html).
In TPTP 4.5, the AGR was moved from a Technology Preview component to an As-Is component. As-Is components are primarily provided for prior users but imply no support (for example, defects, news group, and mailing lists) or commitment to triage or resolve opened defects. For this defect to be considered, please re-open with an attached patch including code to resolve the symptom and test cases to test the fix.
Closing by default since not closed by the originator in the 7+ months since
being resolved.  

Please reopen if the issue is still present in the latest TPTP release or the
resolution is not correct.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I've found that a common feature that users ask for is to have support in
recording and playing back test cases in an RCP application.

The general dependence of the test framework on the IDE environment has to be
investigated.  Based on this investigation, further enhancements may need to be
opened to eliminate some of the test components dependence on the IDE environment.

Users may not get the full advantage of the test framework in an IDE environment
but they should generally be given a fairly consistent user interface to record
and playback test cases.

Both RCP and stand-alone SWT applications would be beneficial.
Could this technology be used for general record/playback ("macros") in Eclipse, like in bug 8519?

Hi,I don't think this new feature can only be used in Eclipse frameword.We really hope this feature can support us in not only Eclipse,but also some other Application Framework such as IE and Mozela.Thanks ! I really hope more people will vote for it!
proposed to be planned for 4.2 but no resources are available (helpwanted keyword added)

Target set to 4.2
Hi My company has a RCP application that would benefit greatly from this product enhancement.  The tool looks good and I can't wait to use and have my developers use verification hooks to test new UI features.

Thanks,

helpwanted for 4.3
At the moment, we are using WindowTester where I work:

http://www.instantiations.com/rcpdeveloper/index.html

Would fixing this bug result in functionnality similar to that commercial product?

We have had some amount of success but it is a bit painful and does not track every event at the moment.  

We also don't just record entire "acceptance tests" for the application but unit test each dialog which is more useful because there is too much setup otherwise - the test becomes too complicated.
Since JFace apps are mostly based on actions, adding a recording API to Action might already get some way where we need to be.

I mean, there is no need to actually click the buttons (determining their position, sending mouse events, etc).

I'm thinking about something like the Java logging API or maybe even (ab-)using the logging API to record events.

But we would need to spread Action everywhere (for example, into Dialog und subclasses).

The next step would be to add this API to all the SWT classes like Text, StyledText, Tree, etc, so they could record events.

-------
It is possible to edit a launch configuration by ctrl-clicking on it after
dropping down the appropriate menu (eg editing a debug or run launch target in
the debug perspective).  However, when I try to do this in Eclipse 3.1.1 the
dialog appears with the title squashed and is impossible to close again (via the
close or dialog window x buttons), requiring eclipse to be killed from task
manager (since the editor is a modal dialog).

To Reproduce
------------
1) Create a new workspace
2) Create a project with a test class (with a main)
3) Create a run target for it and use the common tab to make it show up in the
run menu and close the launch configuration editor dialog
4) Use the down arrow to the right of the run button drop down the run launch
targets menu, which should now contain your newly created run target.
5) Ctrl left-click the run target to open for editing
6) The dialog shows up with the title text squashed and the dialog can't be
closed using the 'Close' or 'Run' buttons, or the dialog's x button in the
top-right corner.  The dialog is still responsive, it just can't be closed.

Priority Justification
----------------------
I've marked this as normal since any unsaved work will be lost in this
situation, but there is a workaround and I don't know how commonly the
ctrl-click editing functionality is used, other than by me :)

Workaround
----------
The workaround is to stick to using the 'Debug...', 'Run...' and 'External
Tools...' menu items to get to the launch configuration dialog, but obviously
this is not exactly ideal, especially if you have a lot of launch targets.
Forgot to mention, this occurs when I'm running it with both Sun JDK 1.5.0_03
and Sun JDK 1.4.2_08
Can you add a screenshot of the dialog? Can you manually resize the dialog?
Couldn't reproduce this using 3.2 M3 at home, I'll get a screenshot for 3.1.1 when I'm back at work.
Created attachment 30291
Screenshot of crushed and unclosable dialog

Couldn't find any info in the bug writing guide about the preferred image format for screenshots, so I've used jpeg.  Let me know if different file type is required.
I was unable to reproduce in 3.1.1 or 3.2. Marking as works for me.
I was surprised to see this result, so I downloaded 3.1.1 at home and verified that it doesn't show up in a clean install.  I can only conclude that this problem must be related to one of the plug-ins I have installed.  When the final version of 3.2 is released I'll upgrade at work and start afresh.

If I ever get some spare time I may try methodically re-adding the same plug-ins to a fresh 3.1.1 install, just to find out which was the culprit.  In the meantime, I happy for this bug to be closed by QA.

Sorry for any time wasted :(  In future I'll verify any bugs against a clean install.
No problem, thanks for the update.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The Product Export Dialog should persist/restore the Root Directory and Archive
File on a per-configuration basis. Selecting a configuration from the pulldown
menu (or having it pre-populated by the Product Editor) should set these fields
as appropriate.

In a situation where you're repeatedly exporting two products, A and B, you
currently have to change the Root Directory and Archive File every time you export.
Janek, see what you can do for our friend Jared.
Projects are now configured with export settings which the wizard uses to
pre-populate its fields.
Did you mean "projects" or "products"?
I completely meant products, don't know how projects slipped in there.
In that case... Woohoo! :-)
If Janek lived in Beaverton, he would have been knee-deep in home-made cookies 
by now.
Home-made cookies eh? I'll pay for the shipping...
Reopening. Unfortunately, the current implementation isn't quite right.

The settings are currently being stored in the product configuration files. So the files are being dirtied on export in a way that makes them non-portable. For example, if I export to "/home/me/product.zip", my product configuration file will be dirtied with the path "/home/me/product.zip" included.

This information is metadata, not actual project data. It should be stored in the user preferences, not in the workspace content.
I think that information should be stored in the export wizard dialog settings, not in the product file nor in the project settings, as the last two result in outgoing changes.
Wassim and I had a chat about this and came to the realization that the platform has a solution that's perfect for this problem. IResource#set/getPersistentProperty lets you store and retrieve arbitrary properties on a per-resource basis.

So instead of storing the data in the product file or creating a new preference, all we should have to do is set a property on the IResource.
Thanks for the great idea Jared, I added it in and it works great.

    <WithStack>The task data export wizard should have an option to export to a zip file, 
which would be useful when using the wizard for backing up or sending data.
Lowering priority as this isn't necesary for this week or next week. Feel free 
to re-prioritize.
P4 means that we won't do it unless someone else asks for it, but there is a
clear use case right now (back up) so I'm setting it to P3.  
What is the address of the developer page that describes what the priorities 
mean? I can't seem to find it anywhere.
It's not linked yet, will be when the new site goes live (probably Monday)

http://eclipse.org/mylar/dev.html

FYI: Here's the descriptions from dev.html [and how I'm currently interpreting 
them]
P3: considered for next week 
P4: later [will do it, but not next week]
P5: requires user input to be prioritized [won't do it unless someone asks]


Ooops!  Ok, keep interpreting them that way and I'll update the dev page next
week :)

Patch for tasklist
These patches add the export to zip feature and a simple test. The patches 
also include changes for Bug #111870, so please apply these instead.
I just applied this patch and it's looking good.  I think that zip file checkbox
should state the name of the file that it's exporting too.  Also, when I first
tried to do it it thought that the file was a directory (from the last wizard
run I guess) and failed, which makes it seem like the code for idenifying the
path to save to should check if the path is a directory, and the append the
filename.  Jus try to do an export to dir, then to file, then to dir, and if
that all works we should be fine.
I got a whole bunch of the following exception when I tried to export my workspace, and
some entries weren't exported.  Not sure where this bug might be.

Patch for tasklist

I believe the exception was happening because tasks appeared multiple times in
the tasklist file (in different categories) and could not be added to the zip
file twice. I've added a check so that duplicate context files listed in the
tasklist are ignored. When I export it looks like everything appears in the
target zip. Can you check that everything exports properly now in your
workspace?

As for the file as directory location issue, the folder selection dialog should
only be able to return folders, so I don't know what is going on here and
wasn't able to replicate this problem although I tried alternating between
exporting to zip and exporting files. Just in case, I've added a check that the
destination is a folder anyway.
That must have been the problem, and this patch resolves it.  It could use a
progress job, but that's a very minor thing so I'm closing.
I guess setting Wizard.needsProgressMonitor(true) was wishful thinking :) I'll 
see if I can figure out why that isn't working.
He he, no I guess that doesn't quite do it.  You just need the file copy to run
as a UI blocking job (like that pointer I gave you to the ReportManager).  This
is a really minor thing and shouldn't go into 0.4.1, but it's good to know how

    <WithOutStack>The task data export wizard should have an option to export to a zip file, 
which would be useful when using the wizard for backing up or sending data.
Lowering priority as this isn't necesary for this week or next week. Feel free 
to re-prioritize.
P4 means that we won't do it unless someone else asks for it, but there is a
clear use case right now (back up) so I'm setting it to P3.  
What is the address of the developer page that describes what the priorities 
mean? I can't seem to find it anywhere.
It's not linked yet, will be when the new site goes live (probably Monday)

http://eclipse.org/mylar/dev.html

FYI: Here's the descriptions from dev.html [and how I'm currently interpreting 
them]
P3: considered for next week 
P4: later [will do it, but not next week]
P5: requires user input to be prioritized [won't do it unless someone asks]


Ooops!  Ok, keep interpreting them that way and I'll update the dev page next
week :)

Patch for tasklist
These patches add the export to zip feature and a simple test. The patches 
also include changes for Bug #111870, so please apply these instead.
I just applied this patch and it's looking good.  I think that zip file checkbox
should state the name of the file that it's exporting too.  Also, when I first
tried to do it it thought that the file was a directory (from the last wizard
run I guess) and failed, which makes it seem like the code for idenifying the
path to save to should check if the path is a directory, and the append the
filename.  Jus try to do an export to dir, then to file, then to dir, and if
that all works we should be fine.
I got a whole bunch of the following exception when I tried to export my workspace, and
some entries weren't exported.  Not sure where this bug might be.



Created attachment 29371
Patch for tasklist

I believe the exception was happening because tasks appeared multiple times in
the tasklist file (in different categories) and could not be added to the zip
file twice. I've added a check so that duplicate context files listed in the
tasklist are ignored. When I export it looks like everything appears in the
target zip. Can you check that everything exports properly now in your
workspace?

As for the file as directory location issue, the folder selection dialog should
only be able to return folders, so I don't know what is going on here and
wasn't able to replicate this problem although I tried alternating between
exporting to zip and exporting files. Just in case, I've added a check that the
destination is a folder anyway.
That must have been the problem, and this patch resolves it.  It could use a
progress job, but that's a very minor thing so I'm closing.
I guess setting Wizard.needsProgressMonitor(true) was wishful thinking :) I'll 
see if I can figure out why that isn't working.
He he, no I guess that doesn't quite do it.  You just need the file copy to run
as a UI blocking job (like that pointer I gave you to the ReportManager).  This
is a really minor thing and shouldn't go into 0.4.1, but it's good to know how
to make stuff background (which you already know) and UI jobs.

    <WithStack>We need the ability to programmatically launch any application in profile mode,
with any profiling option. For example, just like build systems automate unit
tests and post the results, it should be able to do the same thing using TPTP
for performance. In fact, eclipse's build page already has performance results
set up, that does not use TPTP. Another example, consider C/C++ profilers that
want to plug into TPTP. They will have their own C/C++ launch config type and
delegate, but will need to reuse some of the profiling options, etc.

You do not need to expose the launch delegate for this. Instead, you expose the
attributes that are part of the launch configuration. If you can expose
IProfileLaunchConfiguration constants that would probably do the trick. However,
please don't expose it as-is, it is too JVMPI-agent specific. Make the options
very general, something that can be reused for any other agent.

I am opening this on UI because that's where the constants currently are, but
please migrate the launch delegates and non-UI constants to a non-ui core
plugin, so that profiling can be done headlessly.

Gil, please have a look at the call to ServerUtils.getWebComponentURL inside 
GSTCLaunchCommand. Looks like we're getting a malformed, if not entirely null, 
URL.
*** Bug 114715 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Kathy, would you please take a look at this? Thanks - CB.
Tentatively targetting to M9 since this is a main path scenario. Please 
investigate.
I tried generating a Web service client and specifying "test the Web service" 
using the latest integration candidate driver I200511091028 available at:

http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/committers/drops/I-I200511091028-
200511091028/

I tried it on Red Hat Linux 3.0 with Update 2.  I tried both Tomcat 5.0.28 and 
Tomcat 5.5.12.  The scenario works in both cases.

Please reopen the bug if you still encounter this problem with the latest 
driver.
I downloaded the latest milestone (1.0M9) build source and followed up on this.  The problem is in the use of the Path class in GSTCLaunchCommand.launchCommand().  It appears to me that Path is being used as a convenient means to append to a base URL.  Unfortunately, Path is not ideal for manipulating URLs, only filesystem paths.  Please refer to javadoc for the IPath interface:

  "When a new path is constructed all double-slashes are removed except 
   those appearing at the beginning of the path."

This means that the URL "http://localhost:9080" is turned into "http:/localhost:9080".  This should not be resolved properly when turned back into a java.net.URL object, and I am not certain why it works for you, but it does not for me under J2SE 1.5 (Sun, packaged with the J2EE binaries).  I tried this test driver and get the same result as in eclipse WTP WebService client producer:

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			URL url = new URL("http://localhost:8080/WebServiceProject/sampleServiceProxy/Result.jsp");
			String urlString = url.toString();
			System.out.println("Test.main(): url = " + urlString);
			Path path = new Path(urlString);
			String pathString = path.toString();
			System.out.println("Test.main(): path = " + pathString);
			URL pathUrl = new URL(pathString);
			System.out.println("Test.main(): path url = " + pathUrl.toString());
			pathUrl.openStream();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}

and when run I get the following output:

Test.main(): url = http://localhost:8080/WebServiceProject/sampleServiceProxy/Result.jsp
Test.main(): path = http:/localhost:8080/WebServiceProject/sampleServiceProxy/Result.jsp
Test.main(): path url = http:/localhost:8080/WebServiceProject/sampleServiceProxy/Result.jsp
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: protocol = http host = null
	at sun.net.spi.DefaultProxySelector.select(DefaultProxySelector.java:146)
	at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.plainConnect(HttpURLConnection.java:731)
	at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.connect(HttpURLConnection.java:661)
	at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getInputStream(HttpURLConnection.java:905)
	at java.net.URL.openStream(URL.java:1007)
	at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.consumption.ui.widgets.test.wssample.Test.main(Test.java:23)


Therefore, I would recommend using some other utility to manipulate URL paths, not the org.eclipse.core.runtime.Path class.
Peter, this is very similar to bug 105090.  You indicated in that defect that you could not reproduce the problem in M9.  Could you please take a look at this one as well to see if it's the similar to that one?
Hi Jeff,  we had a similar problem on Susy where the double slash was being converted to a single slash.  The patch for defect 105090 should resolve this issue.  Thanks.

Not a mac developer so I am hoping someone can figure out the Carbon based

Is this in the roadmap to be implemented?  It's missing functionality that should be there on all platforms.

It would be nice to be able to get document icons in an application on the mac.

    <WithStack>Provide an option to change the task data directory to a subdirectory of the 
main data directory. Provide the user with a list of available subdirectories 
to change to or allow a change back to the root data directory.
It doesn't seem like it's possible to plug in an extension that adds a menu 
item with dynamic submenus. So it looks like I'll need to add the menu item 
for this in the TaskListView.
I've never been able to make dynamic menus via extension points.

Where do you plan on keeping the list of directories?
Ok, I'll get the TasklistView in on it then. I was planning on just reading 
the list of available directories from the file system when the menu is 
created.
Perhaps the best thing would be to make the location of the directories a
preference page for monitor.reports?  Then switching can happen via a dialog box
similar to Switch Workspace, but with a list of all the dirs rather than a chooser?
I like the idea of using a dialog box like "Switch Workspace," but it seems 
like accessing it through the preference page might be a bit cumbersome. I'm 
picturing it being used fairly frequently to look at a number of workspaces in 
succession. 
All I meant re the prefs page is using that as the root directory of the
developer dirs, and you should only have to set that once.
Oh. I had simple initial plan for that: Just use the existing data directory 
specified in the Task List preference page. Will this work?
The main Mylar directory needs to be on local disk otherwise things will be too
slow, and Mylar won't work if you're not connected to the network drive.  So I
think that there should be a way to specify an additional place to look for
directories of developer's contexts?
Right. That way developers' contexts can be stored in a central location that 
can easily be accessed by multiple people rather than putting the data in the 
report viewer's workspace.
When switching to a shared developer task data folder, the context capture should be paused
and any active tasks need to be deactivated. 

Does it makes sense for the switch tasks
action to store some state in the plugin class so that the previous active task and/or
the "capture on/off" setting can be restored when switching back to the main workspace?


Also, it it ok to come back to the main workspace when Eclipse restarts?

For the case where the user has a task active when switching, how about it just notifies
the user that the task will be automatically deactivated?

Yes, for the time being I think that it's best to come back to the main
workspace after Eclipse restarts.

Regarding maintaing the active task, it seems best to not add any new preference
state.  Either try to make it work without deactivating the task, by writing out
the task list which stores the task that's active, or simply deactivating it and
'forgetting' what the active task is (so that we can later add API for doing
these switches more gracefully.  And yes, it's fine to just notify the user of this.
FYI: I'm currently investigating why some tasks have relative paths and how 
this affects the ability to switch data directories. 
You mean why they have relative paths in the task list?  I think all that
matters is that the tasklist and tasks are in the same directory, and you won't
be changing that invariant, right?
No, I don't want to change how all the tasks are in the same directory. But 
the existing code for moving files changes the relative task file paths that 
are in the task list file.

Are you saying I can just put the files in the same dir as the tasklist and it 
will work despite the relative paths in the task list file? If so, what are 
those paths for?

What relative paths?  Could you paste in an example?  If you mean stuff like
Path="Bugzilla-102663", that's just the handle to the task context.  By default
the handle is resolved to: &lt;mylardir&gt;/&lt;handle&gt;.xml

So if you switch &lt;mylardir&gt;, you will autmatically be resoliving the contexts to
the new directory.

Hmm, well I'm glad it sounds like this won't be a big issue, but here is some 
of the relative path stuff I need to know more about make sure the changes 
won't cause problems.

From my tasklist.xml:

Here is some code that manipulates the ../../../ part of the paths above when 
changing the mylar data directory (from TaskListManager.java):


    public void updateTaskscapeReferenceHelper(List&lt;ITask&gt; list, String 
prevDir) {
    	for (ITask task : list) {
			if (!task.getPath().startsWith("task-")) {
				if (task.getPath().startsWith("..")) {	
				
					String path = task.getPath();	

					File d = new File(prevDir);
					while (path.startsWith("..")) {
						d = d.getParentFile();
						path = path.substring(3, 
path.length());
					}
					
					String absPath = d.getPath() + "/" + 
path + MylarTasklistPlugin.FILE_EXTENSION;
					absPath = absPath.replaceAll
("\\\\", "/");
					String rel = 
RelativePathUtil.findRelativePath(MylarPlugin.getDefault
().getMylarDataDirectory() + "/", absPath);				
						
					task.setPath(rel);

					taskPropertyChanged(task, "Path");
				} else {
					String absPath = prevDir + "/" + 
task.getPath() + MylarTasklistPlugin.FILE_EXTENSION;
					absPath = absPath.replaceAll
("\\\\", "/");
					String rel = 
RelativePathUtil.findRelativePath(MylarPlugin.getDefault
().getMylarDataDirectory(), absPath);

					task.setPath(rel);

					taskPropertyChanged(task, "Path");
				}
			}
//			updateTaskscapeReferenceHelper(task.getChildren(), 
prevDir);
    	}
    }


Oh geez, I hadn't know about that code (of Ken's) and this was not part of the
design.  How hard would it be to get rid of that code and ensure that tasks are
always beside the tasklist?
It might be hairy to get rid of this and I don't know how it will affect 
people's existing data, but I think it's best to do it now. I'll give it a try.
Exactly, best do it now, and you can just throw up a dialog saying that the task
context is missing, and to place it in the &lt;mylardir&gt; directory.  I doubt that
people are using that feature, but I should check the interaction history logs.  
The Monitor preference page incorrectly sets the main Mylar data directory 
when setting the location of the interaction log file. I think it's best to 
remove the option to set a special interaction log file location and just use 
the main mylar data directory. If this option must be made available, then it 
will need to be made a separate preference store value.

This task is opening up a small can of worms but I think it's coming together 
nicely :)

The above patches make the following changes:
- Revise how the main task data directory is changed to make the changes take 
effect immediately
- Copying of task data to a newly specified directory is temporarily 
unavailable
- A Reports preference page allows for a root shared task directory to be 
specified
- A new action contributed to the task list menu opens a dialog that allows 
the user to change to any shared task directory in the shared task root 
directory
- Code for setting relative paths has been removed
- There are two new tests to cover these changes

This task isn't completely finished yet but I'd like to synch up soon because 
there have been several changes to the code. The remaining issues are:
- The task list needs to indicate which shared task data folder is currently 
active
- The currently active shared folder should not appear in the list of folders 
to switch to
- Option to copy data when selecting a new main mylar data directory
- The new task list menu action needs an icon (currently using a simple folder 
icon)

Great.  Starting to apply now.
I gave it a quick test and it seems to work really well.  I think that we should consider
this UI experimental for now because it will rely on a robust way of exporting/sharing
task activity, which requires server infrastructure, but the functionality is already
useful.  And it's really good that you're getting more familiar with the Task List.

I
enabled the tests and did some other miscalleneous test fixes, and moved one of your tests
into the MiscTests (because it relies on the task list being active so it can't be in
the monitor tests).  Could you synch up and let me know if you get a green bar from running
all tests?

Making this experimental for now works for me. 

I've synched up and run the test cases (80 of them) and now the only test that 
fails is testErrorInterest. 
Please synch up, and run the tests (should be 92 now) and let me know if any fail.
Of the 92 tests, only testErrorInterest fails :(
I've commented out the failing assertion in that test until we have a harness
that can wait on all resource markers being propagated.  All should pass now.
Ok, they all pass now over here too :)</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Provide an option to change the task data directory to a subdirectory of the 
main data directory. Provide the user with a list of available subdirectories 
to change to or allow a change back to the root data directory.
It doesn't seem like it's possible to plug in an extension that adds a menu 
item with dynamic submenus. So it looks like I'll need to add the menu item 
for this in the TaskListView.
I've never been able to make dynamic menus via extension points.

Where do you plan on keeping the list of directories?
Ok, I'll get the TasklistView in on it then. I was planning on just reading 
the list of available directories from the file system when the menu is 
created.
Perhaps the best thing would be to make the location of the directories a
preference page for monitor.reports?  Then switching can happen via a dialog box
similar to Switch Workspace, but with a list of all the dirs rather than a chooser?
I like the idea of using a dialog box like "Switch Workspace," but it seems 
like accessing it through the preference page might be a bit cumbersome. I'm 
picturing it being used fairly frequently to look at a number of workspaces in 
succession. 
All I meant re the prefs page is using that as the root directory of the
developer dirs, and you should only have to set that once.
Oh. I had simple initial plan for that: Just use the existing data directory 
specified in the Task List preference page. Will this work?
The main Mylar directory needs to be on local disk otherwise things will be too
slow, and Mylar won't work if you're not connected to the network drive.  So I
think that there should be a way to specify an additional place to look for
directories of developer's contexts?
Right. That way developers' contexts can be stored in a central location that 
can easily be accessed by multiple people rather than putting the data in the 
report viewer's workspace.
When switching to a shared developer task data folder, the context capture should be paused
and any active tasks need to be deactivated. 

Does it makes sense for the switch tasks
action to store some state in the plugin class so that the previous active task and/or
the "capture on/off" setting can be restored when switching back to the main workspace?


Also, it it ok to come back to the main workspace when Eclipse restarts?

For the case where the user has a task active when switching, how about it just notifies
the user that the task will be automatically deactivated?

Yes, for the time being I think that it's best to come back to the main
workspace after Eclipse restarts.

Regarding maintaing the active task, it seems best to not add any new preference
state.  Either try to make it work without deactivating the task, by writing out
the task list which stores the task that's active, or simply deactivating it and
'forgetting' what the active task is (so that we can later add API for doing
these switches more gracefully.  And yes, it's fine to just notify the user of this.
FYI: I'm currently investigating why some tasks have relative paths and how 
this affects the ability to switch data directories. 
You mean why they have relative paths in the task list?  I think all that
matters is that the tasklist and tasks are in the same directory, and you won't
be changing that invariant, right?
No, I don't want to change how all the tasks are in the same directory. But 
the existing code for moving files changes the relative task file paths that 
are in the task list file.

Are you saying I can just put the files in the same dir as the tasklist and it 
will work despite the relative paths in the task list file? If so, what are 
those paths for?

What relative paths?  Could you paste in an example?  If you mean stuff like
Path="Bugzilla-102663", that's just the handle to the task context.  By default
the handle is resolved to: &lt;mylardir&gt;/&lt;handle&gt;.xml

So if you switch &lt;mylardir&gt;, you will autmatically be resoliving the contexts to
the new directory.

Hmm, well I'm glad it sounds like this won't be a big issue, but here is some 
of the relative path stuff I need to know more about make sure the changes 
won't cause problems.

From my tasklist.xml:

&lt;BugzillaReport Active="false" Bugzilla="true" Complete="true"

Here is some code that manipulates the ../../../ part of the paths above when 
changing the mylar data directory (from TaskListManager.java):


    public void updateTaskscapeReferenceHelper(List&lt;ITask&gt; list, String 
prevDir) {
    	for (ITask task : list) {
			if (!task.getPath().startsWith("task-")) {
				if (task.getPath().startsWith("..")) {	
				
					String path = task.getPath();	

					File d = new File(prevDir);
					while (path.startsWith("..")) {
						d = d.getParentFile();
						path = path.substring(3, 
path.length());
					}
					
					String absPath = d.getPath() + "/" + 
path + MylarTasklistPlugin.FILE_EXTENSION;
					absPath = absPath.replaceAll
("\\\\", "/");
					String rel = 
RelativePathUtil.findRelativePath(MylarPlugin.getDefault
().getMylarDataDirectory() + "/", absPath);				
						
					task.setPath(rel);

					taskPropertyChanged(task, "Path");
				} else {
					String absPath = prevDir + "/" + 
task.getPath() + MylarTasklistPlugin.FILE_EXTENSION;
					absPath = absPath.replaceAll
("\\\\", "/");
					String rel = 
RelativePathUtil.findRelativePath(MylarPlugin.getDefault
().getMylarDataDirectory(), absPath);

					task.setPath(rel);

					taskPropertyChanged(task, "Path");
				}
			}
//			updateTaskscapeReferenceHelper(task.getChildren(), 
prevDir);
    	}
    }


Oh geez, I hadn't know about that code (of Ken's) and this was not part of the
design.  How hard would it be to get rid of that code and ensure that tasks are
always beside the tasklist?
It might be hairy to get rid of this and I don't know how it will affect 
people's existing data, but I think it's best to do it now. I'll give it a try.
Exactly, best do it now, and you can just throw up a dialog saying that the task
context is missing, and to place it in the &lt;mylardir&gt; directory.  I doubt that
people are using that feature, but I should check the interaction history logs.  
The Monitor preference page incorrectly sets the main Mylar data directory 
when setting the location of the interaction log file. I think it's best to 
remove the option to set a special interaction log file location and just use 
the main mylar data directory. If this option must be made available, then it 
will need to be made a separate preference store value.

This task is opening up a small can of worms but I think it's coming together 
nicely :)

The above patches make the following changes:
- Revise how the main task data directory is changed to make the changes take 
effect immediately
- Copying of task data to a newly specified directory is temporarily 
unavailable
- A Reports preference page allows for a root shared task directory to be 
specified
- A new action contributed to the task list menu opens a dialog that allows 
the user to change to any shared task directory in the shared task root 
directory
- Code for setting relative paths has been removed
- There are two new tests to cover these changes

This task isn't completely finished yet but I'd like to synch up soon because 
there have been several changes to the code. The remaining issues are:
- The task list needs to indicate which shared task data folder is currently 
active
- The currently active shared folder should not appear in the list of folders 
to switch to
- Option to copy data when selecting a new main mylar data directory
- The new task list menu action needs an icon (currently using a simple folder 
icon)

All tests pass after making these changes and the new test cases pass when run 
individually. But when I run AllTests including the new tests, the usual 
suspects failed. It seems like any test I add causes testErrorInterest and

    <WithStack>A diagram definition may be mapped to zero or more domain models. In other

Yes, exactly. And one of the domain models should be marked as non-semantic, i.e. optionally permit at runtime (e.g. through double clicking of linked element) change its visibility. In this case, the connector also should have the same visibility as linked model
And what does Target milestone: M3 mean. I shall need to install Eclipse3.2M3 in order to have this feature when it is resolved?
M3 refers to the 1.0M3 release of GMF.  Target has been updated.
Does this requirement mean that it should be possible to generate a single GMFmap for an editor to contain, for example, both TaiPan and MindMap elements on the same diagram? And what about the case where zero domain models are mapped?
Yes, it means both of the cases you mention.
Case of zero domain models won't be supported in M5

Not sure I understand Dmitry's last comment ;-)
Sometimes bugzilla requires to enter non-empty comment but there is nothing actually to comment thus dash meaning 'nothing to say'. I guess I was changing platform or os.
Pure notational diagrams (no domain model) are supported in 1.0; see

Hm there already are the expand-all / collapse-all commands for trees by your

    <WithStack>A diagram may have elements added from other referenced diagram definitions.
Is this about shortcuts on the diagram or just being able to use figures defined in some .gmfgraph model when constructing another .gmfgraph?
Good question, as it is poorly worded.  To my recollection, this requirement is concerned primarily with the diagram allowing shortcuts.  The ability to reuse figures across .gmfgraph models seems already in place.
It is possible to specify in gmfgen model two following properties:
- containsShortcutsTo
- shortcutsProvidedFor

First describes domain model file extensions for the domain which elements could be added as a shortcut to this diagram. Second allows to add shortcuts to the elements of this diagram to the limited set of domain model diagrams. Both properties should be specified to correctly generate "create shortcut" action.

Currently it is possible to shortcut only top-level diagram elements.

    <WithStack>Diagram definitions should support a logical grouping of diagrams, as required 
by the UML, for example.
Not sure what this means, really.  The toolsmith is free to organize and target 
generation to whatever grouping is desired/required.
Oooooh, UML!
would be nice to have it?

UML has:
- attributes and stereotypes
U may mark element or diagram with "isVisible", "isAbstract", "isLeaf", "isRoot",etc.
- GeneralizableElement. It is a diagram or element that has no instances. It is possible to specify a grapelement/diagram (template) for further specification
- COMPONENT
Provides physical packaging for one or mre ModelElements
- Diagram It is an abstract subtype of ViewElement. What is interesting is that ViewElement is not necessarily graphical, it may be textual
- ComponentDiagram
- DeploymentDiagram
encompasse Components and Nodes
- package, type (Everybody knows and/or does it)
- stereotype
It is extension mechanism. Someone can define its own stereotype with which to mark elements and thereafter, I guess, to group according to it
- Viisibility. 
Though it is not only about graphics but in its more general meaning  it is even more useful.

extension points.
I'd like to have beanshell
http://beanshell.org/
ASAP
Version/Target updated.
With regexp, OCL and Java supported I feel this request is accomplished. Reopen this/file new one when there's need for another language.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to add an extension-point to support other languages?

    <WithStack>Diagram and/or domain models may have constraints added which need to be 
manifested as feedback in the graphical editor. For example, a constraint 
indicating that circular relationships are not allowed should be indicated in 
the UI while attempting to make such a connection.
I propose to change the Summary of this "bug", 
aka task, 
to "Provide UI support (*) for constraint definition",
because it collide with resolved bug
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=114193
"Provide support for OCL"

(*)
did u mean "feedback" by description?
Constraints can be defined for both the domain and notation model (selectively 
per semantic element type).
UI feedback is realized by use of problem markers.

    <WithStack>Provide support for the Object Constraint Language for use in graphical

This requirement was satisfied with the initial runtime contribution.
(In reply to comment #1)
&gt; This requirement was satisfied with the initial runtime contribution.

Can anyone tell me what version of OCL is supported, and where I can read about GMF's usage of it?
Do you support full UML2.0 OCL, or another kind of OCL?
I'm asking because I see that I can use the OCL expression "self &lt;&gt; oppositeEnd" in my gmfmap model (which is not defined in UML2.0), and I can NOT use the UML2.0 expression "source &lt;&gt; oclIsTypeOf(Call_C_Party)", i.e. it does accept the latter OCL expression but it seems to do nothing with it during execution.

    <WithStack>A graphical surface for mapping definitions should be provided, preferably 
bootstrapped using GMF itself.
Given our current understanding of what the mapping model contains, and what we are able to produce given our current bootstrapping capabilities, this feature will need to be shifted to a later date.

A brief discussion of what this will look like with the tooling team revealed that we need to solicit feedback from the community on what UI would be most appropriate for this model.  The mapping UI provided by EMF (and used by Merlin) is not the most intuitive, while a standard block and line UI will not scale well.

Another option would be to have a multi-page editor and the capability to edit the mapping model and its associated graphical, tooling, and even domain models simultaneously.

Feedback and voting on this item is requested.
Version/Milestone updated
As alternative of this, I propose a textual editor for the mapping definition.

    <WithStack>A generation option to target RCP application should be provided in the 
generator model, to complement that provided by EMF.
Updated Version/Milestone.
Created attachment 38918
Fixes the subj for the Lite Generator case

The option itself has not been added, instead it is taken from the corresponding .genmodel model (it seems reasonable to align values of this option for the diagram editor and the underlying domain model, anyway)
Patch for Lite generator reviewed and committed.
Sounds great for my project! Could we have details on what this RCP flag generates as an RCP application? Also, when will this be released, 3.2 RC1?
Hello,
Can you explain how to generate an RCP application instead of an eclipse editor for GMF
Hi,
First, you need to obtain the GMF SDK Experimental (available as a separate download) and use it along with the GMF SDK proper, because the RCP generation is currently available only for the pure-GEF ("Lite") version of the generator.

In the .genmodel for your domain model, check the option to generate RCP application. 
Produce all .gmf* models as you would do for a non-RCP application (while creating the generator model, specify that enhanced figures should NOT be used). 
Finally, as the last generation step, use the action "Generate pure-GEF diagram code" instead of "Generate diagram code". This will activate the "lite" version of the generator and will produce the RCP application.

Of course, being RCP does not mean that it will run with org.eclipse.rcp feature only. You will need at least GEF and EMF features as well. Depending on the complexity of your model (e.g., whether you have feature initializers and/or constraints), you may also have to bundle OCL-related features. 
Hi Boris,

Thanks for the detailled steps. I was able to run my GMF application as a RCP product. I had a couple of small issues with the generated editor plugin:
 - Collections used without import (java.util)
 - gmf.runtime.draw2d dependencies not added to the plugin.xml causing compliation errors
 - usage of deprecated API: getSite().getKeyBindingService()
 - import of some unused package generating a warning

Also, when trying to run the RCP application, I realized that many dependencies were required. Below is a complete list of the plugins I had to include. Is everything really required?

Hi Jerome,
In recent builds, there is an option not to generate figures that reference gmf.runtime.ui. In this case, only org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.* plugins that are needed are .notation and .notation.edit. This will also eliminate the need for org.apache.batik, org.eclipse.core.resources (and related plugins), org.eclipse.ant.core, org.eclipse.core.filesystem (and the related fragment), org.eclipse.team.core, org.eclipse.ui.console, org.eclipse.ui.forms and org.eclipse.update.* -- unless your plugins require them.

Also, since recently, references to gmf.runtime.draw2d should be added automatically if "use enhanced figures" option is used, so the code should stay compilable (although the very idea of pure-GEF approach does not fit well with using gmf.runtime figures). 

I should note, however, that the use of ocl will add the requirement to have org.eclipse.core.resources and everything it depends on. Also, a planned change to introduce transaction support into the pure-GEF generator will make org.eclipse.core.resources a required plugin, because org.eclipse.emf.transaction requires it.
Boris,

After playing a little more with the pure-GEF option, it seems that we are losing many interesting GMF options in this mode, like the layout tools or the contextual links creation...

Personnaly, I'm looking for a mode that would allow me to run a fully-featured GMF diagram as an RCP application with any plugin that makes sense (like core.resources) but without all the IDE related plugins as my application has nothing to do with a fully-feature IDE like Eclipse.

Is something like this on your road-map?

Hi Jerome/Boris,

I went thru the exact steps mentioned, and when I run through it, the code throws a class cast exception... I am using the mindmap example...
On a little investigation, I found that 
diagramRoot = (Map) diagram.getElement();
was causing that exception. diagram.getElement() returns DocumentRootImpl where as the casting expects a map object. I am not sure abt how it internally works and whats causing it.

It looks like I am missing something...

Any ideas??
