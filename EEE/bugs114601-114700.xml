    <WithStack>If there's an error in a builder associated with a project, and we launch
something in that project, the error is ignored and the launch proceeds. 

I used this as my "builder"

&lt;project default="echo"&gt;
	&lt;target name="echo"&gt;
		&lt;echo&gt;I am a builder&lt;/echo&gt;
		&lt;sleep seconds="3"&gt; &lt;!--broken here---&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
The java launcher ignores errors in Ant build files. This was intentional to avoid prompting the user about ant errors when launching Java. In general its hard to know if an Ant build file effects a project's class files (I suppose a builder should).

Deferred for now. Marking as enhancement.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>whenever you copy/paste, or add breakpoitns to a new working set in which the 
breakpoint will appear in more than one grouping, the checked state does not 
update for all occurences of the breakpoint.

Steps to produce:
1. create some breakpoints (a class one specifically)
2. create some advanced groupings (I used WS as the top level and breakpoint 
types as the next level)
3. copy the class breakpoint from one working set to the other

The copied breakpoint will appear as unchecked, even if its other occurence is 
checked.

    <WithStack>Non-Line breakpoints do not update their selection ranges (which become
highlighed when doubleclicking the breakpoint) after refactorings which change
the type name or package name.

Example: you have Test.java in the package testPackage, and Test.java contains a
watchpoint, a method breakpoint and a line breakpoint. WHen double-clicking on
any of the breakpoints, they highlight the appropriate area. After renaming Test
to Tester, all the textual selections (not the linebreakpoints, which are
determined by line number) will be off by 2 characters.
The same thing happens when renaming packages, or moving the type into a package
whose name length is different than that of the package in which the breakpoints
were originally created.
Yes, this was a problem I marked as a TODO in the refactoring code. The 
implementation issue is that when the refactoring is invoked, the new java 
element does not exist yet, so I cannot ask for the new name range.
*** Bug 128880 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Using RC0, the new type does exist when performnig a type change. Should be able to fix.
Debugging in the M6, it appears as the new type, etc., do exist when performing the refactoring, so we should be able to update name ranges.
Fixed. Changes in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.refactoring

    <WithStack>Support disabling auto-activation temporarily. This could be supported in the
form of an operation (a runnable). In the context of that operation, if a class
from a plug-in that is not active yet is to be loaded, and that would cause
auto-activation to kick in, don't load the class, just fail.

This would work well with the Eclipse-AutoStart header. 

Use cases:
- content type describers are all instantiated when the content type registry is
created. Content type providers are warned that content describers should not
cause auto-activation (through the use of Eclipse-AutoStart), but that is not
enforced.

- the adapter manager ignores factories for plug-ins that are not active. That
restriction could be changed to "adapter factories that would trigger
auto-activation will be ignored". 

I believe this could be used in the context of other extension points as well.

I understand that this mechanism would not help if the work that would cause
auto-activation ends up being done in a different thread.
An interesting proposal.  Would it be bad for people to suddnely start getting 
ClassNotFoundErrors?

I'm not sure I understand what is being asked.  Are you requesting an 
enhancement to Eclispe-LazyStart to list a set of classes that should not 
cause the bundle to be started lazily AND should not be allowed to load unless 
the bundle is already started?

If that is the case who needs to be aware that a ClassNotFoundException will 
be thrown depending on if the bundle is active or not?
Re: comment 1 - the exception message could contain an explanation why the
framework refused to load a class ("auto-activation is forbidden"). The client
of the proposed feature wants to make sure its clients are well-behaved. A class
not found exception here means a bug in the client code (that should not be
loading classes that would trigger auto-activation).

Re: comment 2 - what is being requested here is API for running runnables for
whose duration auto-activation is forbidden. I don't know about
Eclipse-LazyStart (did you mean Eclipse-AutoStart?), but no changes to manifest
headers are needed.

The implementation could be based on thread locals. Before running the client
provided runnable, an AUTO_ACTIVATION_FORBIDDEN thread local would be set to
true. Before starting a bundle, the EclipseClassLoader would check if auto
activation is forbidden. If it is, it should throw a ClassNotFoundException.

I am not familiar enough with Java classloading to be 100% sure this is
implementable. For instance, are missing classes always looked up, or if the
lookup fails for the first time, we don't bother doing the lookup again? If that
is the case, then I don't think this can be implemented.
The problem you describe sounds very similar to bug 131966, although the solutions are different.  Rafael do you agree?  Can we dup this bug to bug 131966?
If that approach has better chances of being implemented, I am fine with this being marked as duplicate.

    <WithStack>when you refactor a method signature, if there is a method breakpoint on that 
method it is not updated after the refactoring is complete.

Steps to reproduce:
1. create a method breakpoint on an existing method
2. refactor the method's signature using Refactor-&gt;Change method signature

The corresponding breakpoint is not updated with the new signature info.
Appears the refactoring participants are not considered on a signature change, 
so we have no way to update via refactoring participants. 

This case has a bad side effect. Double-clicking the breakpoint in the ruler 
adds a new breakpoint on the new method, and does not remove the old 
breakpoint.

JVM crash log
Are all of the JVM crash dumps similar?  In this log, it is in the JVM code
where the crash occurs.  I would suspect a bug in the JVM, or maybe bad RAM in
your machine or something like that.
Yes, the two or three times this happened, crash dumps are almost identical. As
I said, it's not a frequent ocurring, thankfully. It's just that I've never
another java application crash in this machine (not when using a released
version, anyway).
Can you post another example of a crash log?
The code base has changed significantly since this bug was reported.  If it is still happening for you, please reopen this bug report.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>This appears to be a re-paint issue. When the combo appears for a 'normal' 
priority item it's aligned on the left side of the column (covering it) but 
when it appears for 'high' or 'low' priorities then it's right-adjusted to -not-
 cover the icon. Changing back to 'normal' it doesn't repaint (you just have to 
force a repaint in order to clear it up...).

We could fix this either by forcing a re-paint or by changing the alignment 
rules so that the combo is always left-aligned on the column (i.e. covers 
it)...suggestions ??
This is because there is no icon for normal and so the layout is different

And here I thought that we were guarding against all the lazy startup dangers...

What was the effect of this, did you have to hit Stop on the progress dialog, or
kill Eclipse?  Did Mylar come up properly after restart?  Also, I'm curious
about what's forcing you to use 3.2M1 (Subclipse)?  We'll only be able to
support the latest milestone of 3.2 because of the cost of merging, but
hopefully initialization order could fix this issue for the 3.1 stream.

The workbench window was gray. So I had to kill it.

Looks like it did.

It doesn't seem that Subclipse is actually that sensitive (turns out that my
workspace have some garage that make it worse on 3.2M2). 
However AJDT does not have update site for 3.2 stream.

Right. When 3.2M3 get out, I'll have to decide what I like more - new M3
features or convenience of getting new AJDT builds...
Eugene, I saw this happen once and will keep an eye on it.  There was no bad
behavior, since this class actually does get loaded.  Let me know if you see it
again.
Another user ran into this, scheduling for this week.

    <WithOutStack>I've installed Mylar 0.4 from the update site and Eclipse freeze after restart.
Log file is below.
That was Eclipse 3.2M1 with Mylar for 3.1 stream.

It is Laszlo, which is basically JavaScript embedded in some XML markup.

It doesn't work in JSP files either. Is this the same bug or should I file a separate one?

    <WithStack>Currently, the xdoclet builder is hardcoded to get added on a project during

should be controlled by adding/removing an xdoclet facet.  Possibly, a page
could be added to the project creation with a link to the xdoclet properties. 
But then this info could be removed from the bean creation wizard first page as
well.  Also, existing ptojects could then add the xdoclet builder just by going
to add/remove facets on the project.  This also leaves propietery annotation
builders the option of adding their own facet.
Two new facets are added

jst.web.xdoclet  (depends on jst.web)
jst.ejb.xdoclet  (depends on jst.ejb)
OK, I don't see the facets added on annotated bean or servlet creation though.  I take it this is a defect.  Will close this enhancement.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Version 3.2M2 (Build id: I20050923-1000)

I have the Mark Occurrences toggled to 'on'. Usually works like a charm: I 
click on a variable and see all its occurrences in the file highlighted in 
yellow (incredibly useful feature).

I edit a line declaring a Collection object (a Vector in this case) to add the 
generics '&lt;...&gt;' parameter. The collection name stays highlighted even though 
I click on the variable itself (if I double-click then the variable gets 
highlighted in blue indicating it was selected but it still does not get 
marked in the file.

I am able to get the marking mechanism to work again by clicking on a 
different variable in the file and then getting back to the line I just 
edited. It also works if I click on another window and then get back to the 
Eclipse window.

To reproduce:

0) toggle the Mark Occurrences to on; I've also set the compiler option to 
flag as a warning the usage of raw classes without the generic parameters 
specified

1) open a Java file 
2) add lines
       Vector myVar = new Vector;
       . . .
       some lines that reference 'myVar'
3) click elsewhere in the file
4) go back to the newly added line and click on the Vector (it should become 
highlighted in yellow)
5) add &lt;Integer&gt; to both Vector instances in the line
6) click on 'myVar' - the other instances in the file *do not* get highlighted 
in yellow
7) click elsewhere in the file (on another variable in another line) or 
outside the Eclipse window.
8) now click on 'myVar' and things work properly

Is it a typo or you forgot the () after new Vector in
 Vector myVar = new Vector;
?

Clearly a typo. Have you been able to reproduce problem?

This works for me using I20051031-0010.

    <WithStack>The handling of the selection here is inconsistent at best...try this:

Import / check out / create a plugin project with some extensions in it.

Open the Property View

Open the 'MANIFEST.MF' file (notice that we've lost the entry that was 
displayed when we clicked on the file in the PE)

Now, alternate between re-selecting a file in the PE (to show its properties) 
and selecting other tabs in the editor. It's somewhat indeterminate but it 
appears that if you select a 'text' oriented tab (i.e. 'build.properties'), re-
select a file in the PE and then select a tab that has already been displayed 
then the property view maintains showing the file. If its the first time that 
the editor tab has been displaye then the property sheet goes blank. (lazy 
creation issue??)

Also, until you select a text-oriented tab you'll lose the file every time you 
change tabs, even when switching between two 'populated' tabs...
Is this still a problem in 3.3?

    <WithStack>The svg charting service can be automated by first generating a control set of 
svg file.  This control set of svg files will be compared with future test 
passes. 

ID generation should be keep consistent during each test pass so that the 
controlled svg files can be properly compared to the files generated in each 
test pass.  

It should also be possible to compare the static images generated by the 
charting service.
the test cases are now automated as junit tests.

This works when deleting all bookmarks, or deleting bookmarks that were added

reproducable in 3.1.1.
Sending back to inbox since not being actively worked on.
I recall fixing a few bookmark problems earlier.. can you see if this one is still reproducible?
Still reproducable in 3.2 RC7, will investigate.
Created attachment 46211
Fixes the bug.

The bookmark was being added with the ?resultof parameter in the href. This was preventing it from being removed correctly upon bookmark deletion. Added a method to ReusableHelpPart to parse the href and remove any parameters before creating the bookmark.
Patch applied.

This also fixes another side effect of the ?resultof where viewing such a bookmark would result in highlighting of the original search query from which the bookmark was created. This one is also fixed with the patch.
This bug is reproducible again in I20070608-1718. Reopening.
This should be corrected again for 3.3.1.
Created attachment 71212
Patch for 3.3.1 stream

The previous fix was to a piece of code which is no longer used when the add bookmark button is clicked from the toolbar. It instead goes directly to the bookmark manager with the href that the BrowserPart is pointing at. In the case of a search result, this href has the query parameter on it. The previous fix is still required for the case of adding the bookmark from the context menu for a search result.

Since the fix for the BrowserPart toolbar button also needed to strip out the parameter, I moved the method introduced by the previous fix out of the ReusableHelpPart and created a utility class in org.eclipse.help.base called LinkUtil to provide it.
Adam can you write a few JUnit tests for LinkUils.StripParams() and attach them as a second patch? This kind of string manipulation utility is always a good candidate for adding JUnit tests. See org.eclipse.ua.tests.cheatsheet.other.TestEscape for an example of such a test.
Created attachment 72987
Patch with JUnit tests

New patch includes JUnit tests for LinkUtil.stripParam(). Also makes the method null safe.
Fixed in HEAD.

Updated Apache Log Correlation Doc to resolve 114628

As per Dave's instructions I removed the Requirements section and added the
following description to the opening paragraph:

"Note: the log files to be analyzed and correlated are included in this sample.
 To find out how to import log files into TPTP, refer to the Log Parser Sample
(File &gt; New &gt; Example... &gt; Logging &gt; Log Parser Sample)."

Also, I changed the "Default Time" correlation element mentioned in the
"Performing a Time-based correlation.." section to "Time".
Not sure what action is required. Your comments seem to suggest you took care 
of the required changes to doc and samples. Please clarify if I am missing 
something.
As is the case here, I usually attach patched files to bugzilla threads for 
Ruth Lee to review and submit. Sorry, I should have reassigned this bug earlier.
Fix approved by Sri, reviewed and checked in by Ruth.
As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant enhancements/defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed.

    <WithStack>If you have a project with several plugins:

1) Plugin 1, that declares as runtime export package X, with class Y inside.
2) Plugin 2, that uses the class Y from the exported package X from plugin 1

You declare in the dependency of Plugin 1 the Plugin 2, and put it as optional.

You close the Plugin 1 project, and a errors appears: "The import X cannot be
resolved".

This error is correct because Plugin 1 is no longer available, and Plugin 2
makes reference to a package of Plugin 1. 

The problems come next.

You reopen Plugin 1, and the error disapears, but a new one appears: "Access
Restriction: The type Y is not accessible due to restrition on required project 1"

The workaround is to go to Plugin 2 and save again the Dependency of Plugin 1.

    <WithStack>We keep coming across the problem where we need to go from an IDocument to the
IResource path.

Currenly we sort of work around it by getting a Model from the ModelManager,
then getting the base location from that, but that seems clunky.

Also, sometimes there might not be a model (like in the case of Javascript).

I came across this when trying to get the content type of a Javascript file.

If I knew the IResource name, I could get associated content type from the
platform, but I don't, and the file itself doesn't really have a way to identify
itself as Javascript.
The editor can use IDocumentProviderExtension4 to find the content type.  In
what context specifically is this information needed?
BTW, remember that any time you say "document provider" you are implying UI ...
for many "document" functions/requirements, I believe there should a model/core
way to do the function. 

Not sure what use cases specifically Phil is after though. Let's do try to
"abstract out" exactly what's needed -- if possible -- since technically, a
document can exist without (a real) path. 
True enough, but otherwise this is a dupe of bug 108764, right?
I've seen the need for this in jsp usebean content assist, where you are only 
passed the textviewer and you need to figure out the java project.
The specific case is in:

   DocumentRegionProcessor#getContentType(IDocument)

for figuring out which ValidatorStrategy should be used for as-you-type
validation.  

So really what I need is to get ContentType from IDocument,
but without using the input stream technique, because that will just return me
the content type for Text.  I could get the correct content type if I used get
associated content type from the platform (w/ filename).
assigning to myself, just to have an owner associated. 

And, yes, is a "dup" of bug 108764, in a way .. but let's leave this 
one open, as we may solve our own needs at SSE level, before 
proposing more work for platform text. 

Seeing as bug 108764 has been resolved and from the comments this was essentially a dup time to close this one out.

Targeting to future since not containable in 4.4.
As discussed on this week's Test Project call (January 22, 2007), the Test Project will focus on existing P1 - P2/Blocker - Major and P1/Normal and test creation/automation defects (omitting defects dependant on outstanding features) in TPTP 4.4.  All other Test Project defects have been targeted to future.

If this defect has been targeted to future and you/originator feel it should be completed in 4.4, please provide the necessary reason as a reply to this comment or a post to the Test Project mailing list (tptp-test-tooling-dev@eclipse.org).  We will collectively triage and assess our resources to determine a case-by-case decision. 
Correction:  The Test Project mailing list is tptp-testing-tools-dev@eclipse.org.

[Defect #210742]
Log Viewer : navigation button on event part of test log are not enabled by default

Steps To Reproduce:
1.open a test log
2.navigation button on event part of test log are not enabled by default. they
only become enable when you use the "select" button

[Defect #218794]
The five toolbar buttons in test log are disabled after click some verdicts in event tree

There are five buttons in eventpage of test log:
Navigate to First
Navigate to Previous
Select the verdict type to navigate
Navigate to Next
Navigate to Last
when I open one execution file--events page, those buttons are enabled as long
as I don't click some verdict or message in events tree, after I click/expand
the tree by myself, the buttons become disabled

For the button: Selece the verdict type to navigate
the default value for that button is 'All' ,after I choose one type of
verdict(ie.'FAIL'), it will expand the tree contains the first 'FAIL' result,
and those buttons are still enabled as long as I don't click some verdict or
message in events tree, after I click/expand other tree by myself, the buttons
become disabled except the last 'FAIL' result expanded by buttons(navigate
to/first previous/nest/last)

no matter what you choose(or use default'All') in the button to select
verdict type, those 5 buttons are always disabled after you click/expand events
tree except you click the last result expanded by those navigating buttons
See /org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui/src/org/eclipse/hyades/test/ui/forms/actions/VerdictTypesPullDownAction.java.
Defect #218794 is a regression caused by the model scalability work recently completed in 4.4.0 (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=180986#c1).  As a result, the new query-based verdict navigation in Test Log Viewer (/org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui/src/org/eclipse/hyades/test/ui/forms/base/TestLogVerdictTraversalQuery.java) does not support navigating relative to a element selection (other than the current selected verdict event) in the event tree, despite the interface (/org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui/src/org/eclipse/hyades/test/ui/forms/util/ITestLogVerdictTraversal.java) defining such methods.  If the user changes selection from the current selected verdict event, they have to close/reopen the editor or reselect a new verdict type for the navigation buttons.
Created attachment 107135
Patch.

Patch to fix disabling the verdict navigation buttons when there is no verdict in the test log (e.g. 'no verdict').

&gt; If Test log viewer is opened before the test finishes executing, the verdict

Patch Part 3.

Patch to fix the following:

-Enabled the verdict navigation buttons when the Test Log Viewer is first opened (opening the Events tab manually or from the links on the Overview tab) and verdicts events are selected in the event tree.  Since the TestLogVerdictTraversalQuery does not support iterating non-TPFVerdictEvent events, only the first/last navigation buttons will be enabled when non-verdicts events are selected in the event tree.

-Updated the verdict type drop-down to only change the verdict type, notify the listeners, and run the action when the verdict type has changed.

-Updated TestLogVerdictTraversalQuery.java to support navigation relative to a verdict element selection in the event tree.

-Commented the ITestLogVerdictTraversal.java interface.

Sizing updated as provided by Bianaca.
Targeting to future since not containable in 4.4.
As discussed on this week's Test Project call (January 22, 2007), the Test Project will focus on existing P1 - P2/Blocker - Major and P1/Normal and test creation/automation defects (omitting defects dependant on outstanding features) in TPTP 4.4.  All other Test Project defects have been targeted to future.

If this defect has been targeted to future and you/originator feel it should be completed in 4.4, please provide the necessary reason as a reply to this comment or a post to the Test Project mailing list (tptp-test-tooling-dev@eclipse.org).  We will collectively triage and assess our resources to determine a case-by-case decision. 
Correction:  The Test Project mailing list is tptp-testing-tools-dev@eclipse.org.

[Defect #210742]
Log Viewer : navigation button on event part of test log are not enabled by default

Steps To Reproduce:
1.open a test log
2.navigation button on event part of test log are not enabled by default. they
only become enable when you use the "select" button

[Defect #218794]
The five toolbar buttons in test log are disabled after click some verdicts in event tree

There are five buttons in eventpage of test log:
Navigate to First
Navigate to Previous
Select the verdict type to navigate
Navigate to Next
Navigate to Last
when I open one execution file--events page, those buttons are enabled as long
as I don't click some verdict or message in events tree, after I click/expand
the tree by myself, the buttons become disabled

For the button: Selece the verdict type to navigate
the default value for that button is 'All' ,after I choose one type of
verdict(ie.'FAIL'), it will expand the tree contains the first 'FAIL' result,
and those buttons are still enabled as long as I don't click some verdict or
message in events tree, after I click/expand other tree by myself, the buttons
become disabled except the last 'FAIL' result expanded by buttons(navigate
to/first previous/nest/last)

no matter what you choose(or use default'All') in the button to select
verdict type, those 5 buttons are always disabled after you click/expand events
tree except you click the last result expanded by those navigating buttons
See /org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui/src/org/eclipse/hyades/test/ui/forms/actions/VerdictTypesPullDownAction.java.
Defect #218794 is a regression caused by the model scalability work recently completed in 4.4.0 (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=180986#c1).  As a result, the new query-based verdict navigation in Test Log Viewer (/org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui/src/org/eclipse/hyades/test/ui/forms/base/TestLogVerdictTraversalQuery.java) does not support navigating relative to a element selection (other than the current selected verdict event) in the event tree, despite the interface (/org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui/src/org/eclipse/hyades/test/ui/forms/util/ITestLogVerdictTraversal.java) defining such methods.  If the user changes selection from the current selected verdict event, they have to close/reopen the editor or reselect a new verdict type for the navigation buttons.

I am using the code formatter (Ctrl-Shift-F) on the following file, and don't
understand why it inserts a newline in between
"layout"

"				.addPlaceholder".

Is this expected behaviour? To me, it seems that these two lines should be
merged to just one line.

*** Bug 115377 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Michael, since you made the change to put the progress bar at the bottom - is
the intent to leave it there? Making it one pixel wider in the case of Motif?
Actually I mean to CC some designers.  They requested moving it down which
introduces the problem with progress monitors that have different heights.  So I
wanted to consider this problem in general, not just changing the settings to
make it work.  Actually I think it might be nicer in the long run to have a hand
drawn progress bar that just uses the colours we provide, this would make it
standout less on the splash... thoughts
moving to SWT, Kelvin will attach an image of a progress bar with some extra pixels on the sides, that he has some questions about.

I don't see an issue of the progress bar getting cut off.  There are, however, black pixels that appear on the left and right side of the bar.

    <WithStack>Currently you are not able to add plugins to a feature unless they are 
resolved in the target or workspace.  This makes sense but prohibits people 
from crafting features that work on other platforms (or all platforms).  For 
example, how would you edit the RCP feature. It includes all manner of SWT 
fragments.

It might be interesting for people to be able to selectively include plugins 
that are not resolved.  perhaps only those that fail the Platform filter.  
Perhaps some others.

for example, I should not have to have all of RAD just to be able to create a 
feature that includes plugins that depend on RAD.

Perhaps the option is "show unresolved plugins"
Brian, when we resolve the target platform, we currently only add resolved 
bundles to our state and discard the rest.  

This is somewhat heavy-handed.  If, for example, the user has the RCP delta 
pack installed in the target platform, they would only see the fragments that 
match the current environment which can be mystifying.

Since the state can now tell us exactly wny a bundle is unresolved via 
State#getResolverErrors(...), we can use that information to discard only 
bundles that give PDE a headache (e.g. multiple singleton bundles with the 
same id).  The rest should make it into the PDE state.

So check the type of the resolver error of an unresolved bundle.  If it's not 
of type ResolverError.SINGLETON_SELECTION, the unresolved bundle is added to 
the state.

Patch should make PDEState aware of non-resolved bundles that are not multiple
singletons.  This should allow users the ability to add unresolved bundles to
their features.
Thanks Brian.

The patch looks good.

However, you need to break out of the inner loop after setting 'add' to false.

Patch should make PDEState aware of non-resolved bundles that are not multiple
singletons.  This should allow users the ability to add unresolved bundles to
their features.
Thanks Brian.

The patch looks good.

However, you need to break out of the inner loop after setting 'add' to false.

Released the modified patch.</WithOutStack>

There was a change in the facet support, and Konstantin has already fixed this
in HEAD. Will close this bug when this is tagged for an I-build.
Since this just due to a compilation problem, I'll verify that's it's fixed in 
the next I build and then close this bug.

    <WithStack>One of the development environments I work in contains many, many windows shares
mapped to various NFS mount points via Samba.  Sadly, Samba and NFS occasioanlly
have issues (as do the machines hosting the mounts) that can result in a brief
period of time during which one or more files may "disappear" from the NFS world.

In Eclipse, this can be a major headache.  For example, if I define a user
library containing 500 JAR files and one of those JAR files disappears at the
wrong time, my only recourse is to refresh my projects and do a complete
clean/rebuild.  It would be *GREAT* if, instead, when a problem such as ...
    "Project xyz is missing required library: 'Q:\whatever\foo.jar'"
... appear in the "Problems" view, if there was a Quick Fix option to simply
attempt to refresh the offending entry instead of needing to refresh EVERYTHING
and then do a complete rebuild.

The same goes for ANY entity that is supposed to be on the classpath.  I do
realize (and applaud the fact that) there is a preference that can be set to
tell Eclipse not to consider missing path entries to be errors.  But I think
this falls outside of that domain.
Assuming we had a 'refresh JAR' quick fix, I think it would be too late as the
build state is already gone and a rebuild can't be avoided.
Philippe, is that correct?
Hm, I should probably clarify this request some more.  A major part of the
inconvenience that is caused is the refresh of literally tens of thousands of
files in the project just so that Eclipse will re-scan the directories and
library entries that specifically have disappeared.  I could probably go pick
each individual one out by hand, but that would also be a large waste of time.

Maybe an "easy" solution would be to simply make the quick fix to be a "attempt
to refresh all missing library/sourcepath/classpath entries" that would
selectively refresh all those things in the project that seem to be missing,
without refreshing the other 99% of the world.</WithStack>

selectively refresh all those things in the project that seem to be missing,
without refreshing the other 99% of the world.</WithOutStack>

The "Run As &gt; " menu is slow to appear for applets, when invoked from an 
editor displaying an applet.
Also when an applet is selected in the package explorer.
No fix from debug yet. There appears to be a performance inconsistency 
computing the super type hierarchy for types in the default package when more 
than one project has a default package, and the projects have a different JRE 
on the build path. JCORE is investigating.
This is a caching problem. When you launch Eclipse with the default max heap
size, the Java model cache is quickly full if you use 2 different JREs. 
Increasing the max heap size to -Xmx512M fixes this performance inconsistency as
the Java model cache is now function of the max heap size.
Also note that if you remain in the same project (thus using the same JRE) you
will not see any performance inconsistency even with the default max heap size.

(slight) patch

This patch trims back the number of tests slightly, while still maintaining the
same functionality and API, in an attempt to speed up the enablement tests.

One of the noted performance issues which occurs is due to the compilation of
supertype heirarchies. This is done for tests for JUnit, JUnit plugin, and
Applet. If there are a lot of supertypes to be checked it can slow down
considerably (a few seconds of delay).

One examined case is when a class that extends AbstractUIPlugin is the context,
it has been demonstrated to take at most 8 seconds to fly out the menu.
With this patch, the "Java Application/Applet" choices are missing on 
projects/pacakges (containers), and on class file editors. For example, open 
java.util.Base64 and the context menu in the editor no longer has "Run As &gt; 
Java Application". It only has "Run...".

This patch includes a more generalized test for buildpath items, and provides
another test for performing and-wise buildpath tests.

This patch updates the property tester suite to behave exactly as the old ones did for PDE, which adds a slight pruning to the "optimistic" enablement of all menu items for containers. Pruning in this case takes the form of Eclipse Application, Equinox, and JUnit Plugin Test being pruned from list for non-plugin projects.

this following patch is a small update to jdt.debug.ui's plugin.xml file which trims out a few uneeded tests for the Java Application and Applet context menu testers.
Applied patch.
Re-opening, cuz applet in the context menu is still slow.
Moving to JCORE for comment or disposal. It appears to be a swapping issue. Not sure if JCORE wants to address this.
Darin, are you seeing the slowness even after increasing the max heap size ?
No, when I increase the heap size I don't see the slowness. But I still see the slowness when selecting the same applet from the same project iteratively (with default heap size) - i.e. without changing between projects.

This update should be applied in conjuntion with the previous one, it updates eclipse.jdt.debug.ui plugin.xml for the newest tests
Moving to JDT Debug to apply the patch.

Otherwise I still don't understand what swapping issue in JDT Core you're seeing. Please provide steps to reproduce.
Applied patch. Needs more investigation to see if performance is an issue.
Marking fixed. I no longer see the performance problem.

Look at the resource history for UnwovenClassFile.  This bug was fixed on 26th
April this year and included in AspectJ1.5.0M3 - it wasn't fixed in 1.5.0M2.  So
the fix never made it into 1.2.1
'WONTFIX' means I won't fix it for 1.2.1.  The fix is available in final version of AspectJ 1.5.0 (released 20th December) - we have no plans for creating a 1.2.2.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I am getting following error, when I searched previous bugs I found it was
already identified and fixed in version 1.2. I am using 1.2.1.

Look at the resource history for UnwovenClassFile.  This bug was fixed on 26th
April this year and included in AspectJ1.5.0M3 - it wasn't fixed in 1.5.0M2.  So
the fix never made it into 1.2.1
'WONTFIX' means I won't fix it for 1.2.1.  The fix is available in final version of AspectJ 1.5.0 (released 20th December) - we have no plans for creating a 1.2.2.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Using M3 and the information control patches from bug #113104:

On the Mac, the tree's background color is correct for the area with items, 
but incorrect (white) in the empty area below the items.  In other words, if 
the tree is expanded to take up the full area, then the background color is 
fine, but if the tree has an empty area, it is not the same color as the item 
background.

PopupDialog propagates the system info color to all widgets in the tree except 
those explicitly excluded.
- why is the tree background area wrong?
- what did the original AbstractInformationControl do to prevent this 
problem?  It does not have the same problem.
No idea.
I believe this is a dup of bug #37873
I saw this when first testing the PopupDialog version of 
AbstractInformationControl against the original.  At the time I thought I was 
seeing a regression.  However, I just checked it on 3.1.1, 3.2 M3 (pre-
AbstractInformationControl integration with PopupDialog), and on I20051108, 
and all of them have the problem.  Marking as a duplicate of #37873.

When I observed it as a regression, I was using multiple Macs, during a time 
that the SWT/Mac code was also changing significantly.  Or perhaps I just 
observed an expanded tree and mistook it as a regression.

If anyone else thinks this is a regression, please reopen.

apply patch to org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties in org.eclipse.ui.ide
Karice - is this something you are trying to get in for the next build...ie, 
did you want me to review/commit?
Apparently we are not supposed to be releasing anything until the milestone is 
declared.  
ok, I wasn't sure if this was on a list to go in or not.
Susan, can you check this patch?  I just removed the last sentence.  I wasn't 
sure if I should change it to say something like "This can either copy the 
project into the workspace or point to the project in another workspace 
location" or just leave it with the one sentence, which seems to be descriptive 
enough.  
Karice - patch looks good.  I agree that just simplifying the message is the 
way to go.  It also looks like a mnemonic was added to another message in this 
patch.  Is that intentional?
Yes, i forgot to add the mnemonic for the checkbox when i made the patch adding 
this feature.
released to head, should appear &gt;20051107.
leaving open for Karice to double check and mark fixed.

apply patch to plugin.properties of org.eclipse.ui.ide

The same string appears in two different properties files.  The description in
the wizard selection page is taken from plugin.properties.
sorry this took so long.  I applied the patch, actually tested it this time ;-)
Released &gt;20051109.

But that begs the question...what is the other key in DataTransferMessages 
(WizardExternalProjectImportPage_description) used for?  I reverted it to the 
old value and it didn't seem to have an effect.  It's used in the code, but is 
the value overridden by what is supplied in plugin properties?  just wondering.
The string that was originally changed is set as the wizard's descsription in 
WizardExternalProjectImportPage which is the public version of this wizard 
page.  We don't reference this page, but I suppose others that we aren't aware 
of can, so we should maintain the original change.
Sync'd and checked that the wizard description is now accurate.  Marking fixed.

apply patch to org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties in org.eclipse.ui.ide
Karice - is this something you are trying to get in for the next build...ie, 
did you want me to review/commit?
Apparently we are not supposed to be releasing anything until the milestone is 
declared.  
ok, I wasn't sure if this was on a list to go in or not.
Susan, can you check this patch?  I just removed the last sentence.  I wasn't 
sure if I should change it to say something like "This can either copy the 
project into the workspace or point to the project in another workspace 
location" or just leave it with the one sentence, which seems to be descriptive 
enough.  
Karice - patch looks good.  I agree that just simplifying the message is the 
way to go.  It also looks like a mnemonic was added to another message in this 
patch.  Is that intentional?
Yes, i forgot to add the mnemonic for the checkbox when i made the patch adding 
this feature.
released to head, should appear &gt;20051107.
leaving open for Karice to double check and mark fixed.

apply patch to plugin.properties of org.eclipse.ui.ide

The same string appears in two different properties files.  The description in
the wizard selection page is taken from plugin.properties.
sorry this took so long.  I applied the patch, actually tested it this time ;-)
Released &gt;20051109.

But that begs the question...what is the other key in DataTransferMessages 
(WizardExternalProjectImportPage_description) used for?  I reverted it to the 
old value and it didn't seem to have an effect.  It's used in the code, but is 
the value overridden by what is supplied in plugin properties?  just wondering.
The string that was originally changed is set as the wizard's descsription in 
WizardExternalProjectImportPage which is the public version of this wizard 
page.  We don't reference this page, but I suppose others that we aren't aware 
of can, so we should maintain the original change.
Sync'd and checked that the wizard description is now accurate.  Marking fixed.

support for easy sorting in both directions, i.e., if I want to sort a column

I came up with a solution which works pretty good for me, so I suggest adding it

I've implemented some small enhancements to this "framework": You can configure
the default sorting direction of each column, and you can choose if a column
should remember its last sorting direction or not.

we should move all discussion on this to one bug because currently we have 4 I know of:

If you want you can hand over the resulting bug to me because I'm eager on implementation this kind of function in 3.4. By the way we also have a snippet which might be a starting point.

Sure - go ahead and mark as duplicate / assign to you as you see fit.
Mass update - removing 3.4 target. This was one of the bugs I marked for investigation (and potential fixing) in 3.4 but I ran out of time. Please ping on the bug if fixing it would be really important for 3.4, and does not require API changes or feature work.

- import/export &gt; import &gt; Existing projects into workspace

If I select a folder with the same name as a project already in the workspace, 
the project name doesn't show in the list, but there's no explanation as to 
why.  I haven't used this feature in a long time, so it took me some time to 
figure out what was going on.  I thought the feature didn't work at all.

Then I searched bugs until I found bug #80833 and realized what was going on.

I think an error status should explain that you can't import because the 
project already exists.
There are some ideas floating around about what to do in the case of 
duplicates.  I decided to take the path of least resistance to begin with and 
just not show the duplicates, but I see that can be confusing at times.  see 
also bug 91715.  
*** Bug 116011 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Note this related bug: if the project in your workspace has the same name but 
different casing (e.g. MyProject vs. Myproject) than the project in an archive 
file, the project in the selected archive file will appear in the list.

It used to be the case, certainly in 3.1 and I think in 3.2M3 that specifying
the root folder for Import Projects did a tree search and presented a flat
list of all folders containing .project files. (The flattening was a pain.)

The current behaviour is to just add the folder.

When I want to add 6 projects out of 24 it now really tedious. I have to
select each indiovidually. It doesn't even remember where I was last.

Please restore the older behaviour, or add the hierarchical tree to the
tick selectors so that multiple wanted elements are selectable.
The basic behavior of the import existing projects wizards hasn't changed - I still see a flat list.  Can you provide steps, screenshots, and some more info about the projects that are in your workspace and the projects in the selected directory.  I am not sure what you mean when you say "The current behaviour is to just add the folder."

Proposed fix.

This patch contains a dialog that allows to specify a file system directory and
set the "Search Subfolders" options. The "Browse" button can be used to open
the native directory selection dialog.

The title image
Applied patch with a few modifications:

* Allowed 'edit' function to change directory as well as subfolder option
* Modified some NLS string/wordings
* Persisted 'search subfolder' option in dialog store
Please verify, Kevin. Will send images to artist for touchup.
Of course, we should add the same editing for a "workspace" folder.
Mike, take a look at what I (Mikhail) did for the "File system folder" in the 
source lookup dialog. We should do a similar thing for "Workspace folders" to 
allow searching for subfolders.

However, the "check box" for "search subfolders" could be added to the "folder 
selection dialog" (may require a special selection dialog be created) to avoid 
having two dialogs (wizard + folder selection). For the case of external 
folders we have to have to dialogs, as the folder selection dialog is native.
Created attachment 30067
further patch

This is a patch for providing access to searching subfolders to the workspace
folders option as well.

Please verify Darin.

Proposed fix.

This patch contains a dialog that allows to specify a file system directory and
set the "Search Subfolders" options. The "Browse" button can be used to open
the native directory selection dialog.

Applied patch with a few modifications:

* Allowed 'edit' function to change directory as well as subfolder option
* Modified some NLS string/wordings
* Persisted 'search subfolder' option in dialog store
Please verify, Kevin. Will send images to artist for touchup.
Of course, we should add the same editing for a "workspace" folder.
Mike, take a look at what I (Mikhail) did for the "File system folder" in the 
source lookup dialog. We should do a similar thing for "Workspace folders" to 
allow searching for subfolders.

However, the "check box" for "search subfolders" could be added to the "folder 
selection dialog" (may require a special selection dialog be created) to avoid 
having two dialogs (wizard + folder selection). For the case of external 
folders we have to have to dialogs, as the folder selection dialog is native.
Created attachment 30067
further patch

This is a patch for providing access to searching subfolders to the workspace
folders option as well.

Please verify Darin.

!MESSAGE Resource already exists on disk: /scratch/bin/.project.


But I just tried the scenario again, and checked first that there was 
no "scratch" directory on disk in my host workspace.  It still fails as 
originally described, but there was nothing new in the log.  I did the scenario 
again with a new project name, "Test" and had the same problem, but nothing in 
the log...

When I reported "no contents" in the project, I was looking from the Java 
perspective.  If I switch to the resource navigator, I can see the following 
were imported:

scratch/bin/.project
scratch/.project

but none of the other files were imported.  If I go back to disk and look at 
the runtime workspace from where everything was imported, I can see that there 
are many more files/folders that should have been copied.

zip file containing runtime workspace

This is a zip file containing the runtime workspace I'm trying to import from. 
Expand it into the file system and then select the top level folder of the
workspace to try to import the projects.
Interesting...I can successfully import the projects using [copy into 
workspace] if I import from the attached zip.  But if I expand the zip and try 
to import from the file system, I cannot successfully import.  

I think I saw a bug earlier (that had been fixed) involving a difference in 
the separators used for archive files vs. the file system...could it be 
related to that one?  I can troll around for the bug number if you don't know 
what I'm talking about...
the bug that sounds similar (though reversed) is bug #95613.
In that bug, the problem was importing from the zip, not the file system.
Symptoms seem similar, though.
I just expanded the zip and was able to import both projects (from directory) 
and there are lots of files.  Maybe I should get someone using XP to try?
It sounds to me like the import of the files isn't even being attempted.  What 
happens is the project is created and then the import operation (to import all 
the project's files) is setup and run.
yes, might be worthwhile.
I'm running Windows XP Pro Version 2002, Service Pack 1.
How can I check what file system I'm running, in case that matters....
even more interesting:

- I can successfully import (as you did) if I expand the zip file somewhere 
else and import from it.  I just can't import from the original directory (the 
one I compressed to create the zip file!)  
That is strange indeed.  So it sounds like the file system is not a factor.  I 
just get that info by selecting the drive in file explorer and bringing up the 
properties - there should be a file system field.
What would happen if you tried a different setup?  Say, create the plugin 
project but don't get the new plugin wizard to create all the extra stuff and 
instead just import some files from somewhere or create some files/directories.
Even a simple project (non-Java), with just a few text files imported from 
elsewhere exhibits the same problem.  Importing without copying works as 
expected.  Importing with copying does seem to abort the operation, because you 
never even see the progress indicator.
fyi, I'm running NTFS.
I'll try debugging this scenario and report back.
I just debugged it down to FileSystemStructureProvider.getChildren.
For some reason, the File.list() method is returning null, even though the 
folder does have children.  I tried substituting File.listFiles() to see if 
anything different happened, but it also returns null.  So the wizard believes 
there are no files to copy. 

Here is what the file (folder) in question looks like:

element= File  (id=1241)
	path= "C:\\Documents%20and%
20Settings\\Administrator\\workspace\\scritch"
	prefixLength= 3


Just checked the javadoc.  java.io.File.list() only returns null  "if this 
abstract pathname does not denote a directory, or if an I/O error occurs."
So at a minimum we should catch the null case and report that some unknown 
error occurred.

I tried importing from this same directory using a simple file system import 
and it worked.  Could the problem be that the folder was left open or 
something in this code path that causes the problem?

cc'ing John in case he has any insight. 
I just tried importing using the Documents and Settings directory and was able 
to replicate.  I wonder if it's because the directory path has spaces in it?  I 
can investigate further now.


The spaces in the file path are incorrectly being unicode escaped as %20.
I found the problem.  I get the source path from the project's description (an 
IProjectDescription), calling description.getLocationURI().  Then call 
getRawPath() on the URI instead of getPath() which is why the path is messed up 
when File.listFiles() is called.  
cc'ing mvm.  Do we want to fix this for M3?  I think it's worth considering 
because:
- "copy files to workspace" is a new feature 
- it's common to import a project from another workspace
- the default workspace location on windows has a pathname that will exhibit 
the problem.

Created attachment 29225
apply patch to WizardProjectsImportPage.java
do we have tests for import project?  maybe we could also put in a test for a
directory with spaces (on all platforms)as well.

Yes we should consider for M3 assuming you feel there is no risk in the fix.
Both the existing code and patch seem to be vulnerable to 
NullPointerExceptions.  IProjectDescription.getLocationURI() can return null. 
According to the javadoc, the method only returns null if the location of the 
project is the default location.  Since this wizard always imports from another 
location then this should never return null.  In the wizard, if you select the 
workspace's location, no projects appear in the list (we should probably show 
an error message in that case, but that's a separate issue).
I guess I was just confused by the presence of this line: 
	if (Platform.getLocation().isPrefixOf(locationPath))  
		record.description.setLocation(null);  
In build I20051102-1600, if I import an existing project that is already in the
workspace location, and select to copy the contents, I get a
NullPointerException.  Having said that, it makes no sense to copy the contents
if the project is already in the workspace directory. I would suggest something
like:

if (copyFiles){
	// import project from location copying files - use default project location
for this workspace
	URI location = record.description.getLocationURI();
	//only copy the project if it is outside the workspace directory
	if (location != null) {
		importSource = new File(location);
		... etc ...


Doug, the code you pointed out is only run in an error case.  I need to try to 
recreate that case to see what happens when the copy files option is checked.

John, did you get the NPE by creating a project with name Foo, deleting the 
project but not the contents (so it still exists on the file system) then 
importing a project named Foo from a directory with the copy files option 
checked?  
Yes, that's exactly what I did.

Karice, that last patch to the tests doesn't seem to apply even after updating from head.
I think this is because another patch to the same class was released earlier 
today.  
I'll hold off on submitting the fix until a new test patch can be provided.

For some reason, the File.list() method is returning null, even though the 
folder does have children.  I tried substituting File.listFiles() to see if 
anything different happened, but it also returns null.  So the wizard believes 
there are no files to copy. 

Here is what the file (folder) in question looks like:

element= File  (id=1241)
	path= "C:\\Documents%20and%
20Settings\\Administrator\\workspace\\scritch"
	prefixLength= 3


Just checked the javadoc.  java.io.File.list() only returns null  "if this 
abstract pathname does not denote a directory, or if an I/O error occurs."
So at a minimum we should catch the null case and report that some unknown 
error occurred.

I tried importing from this same directory using a simple file system import 
and it worked.  Could the problem be that the folder was left open or 
something in this code path that causes the problem?

cc'ing John in case he has any insight. 
I just tried importing using the Documents and Settings directory and was able 
to replicate.  I wonder if it's because the directory path has spaces in it?  I 
can investigate further now.


The spaces in the file path are incorrectly being unicode escaped as %20.
I found the problem.  I get the source path from the project's description (an 
IProjectDescription), calling description.getLocationURI().  Then call 
getRawPath() on the URI instead of getPath() which is why the path is messed up 
when File.listFiles() is called.  
cc'ing mvm.  Do we want to fix this for M3?  I think it's worth considering 
because:
- "copy files to workspace" is a new feature 
- it's common to import a project from another workspace
- the default workspace location on windows has a pathname that will exhibit 
the problem.

Created attachment 29225
apply patch to WizardProjectsImportPage.java
do we have tests for import project?  maybe we could also put in a test for a
directory with spaces (on all platforms)as well.

Yes we should consider for M3 assuming you feel there is no risk in the fix.
Both the existing code and patch seem to be vulnerable to 
NullPointerExceptions.  IProjectDescription.getLocationURI() can return null. 
According to the javadoc, the method only returns null if the location of the 
project is the default location.  Since this wizard always imports from another 
location then this should never return null.  In the wizard, if you select the 
workspace's location, no projects appear in the list (we should probably show 
an error message in that case, but that's a separate issue).
I guess I was just confused by the presence of this line: 
	if (Platform.getLocation().isPrefixOf(locationPath))  
		record.description.setLocation(null);  
In build I20051102-1600, if I import an existing project that is already in the
workspace location, and select to copy the contents, I get a
NullPointerException.  Having said that, it makes no sense to copy the contents
if the project is already in the workspace directory. I would suggest something
like:

if (copyFiles){
	// import project from location copying files - use default project location
for this workspace
	URI location = record.description.getLocationURI();
	//only copy the project if it is outside the workspace directory
	if (location != null) {
		importSource = new File(location);
		... etc ...


Doug, the code you pointed out is only run in an error case.  I need to try to 
recreate that case to see what happens when the copy files option is checked.

John, did you get the NPE by creating a project with name Foo, deleting the 
project but not the contents (so it still exists on the file system) then 
importing a project named Foo from a directory with the copy files option 
checked?  
Yes, that's exactly what I did.
Created attachment 29273

Note: from comment #26, when you import Foo select the direcotry that is the 
workspace in which you deleted the Foo project but not the contents.

Added a test for this case.
Michael, can you check this patch (and the patch for the added test, too).

Original patch no longer valid after change to WizardProjectsImportPage (for
bug 80833) was released.
Karice, that last patch to the tests doesn't seem to apply even after updating from head.
I think this is because another patch to the same class was released earlier 
today.  
I'll hold off on submitting the fix until a new test patch can be provided.

    <WithStack>When I bring up the expression builder in the M2 BIRT 2.0 build, it does not let
me select data set values when I am constructing a hyperlink.
You need biding the data set before you can access the data set in hyperlink 
builder.
How do a regular report developer know there is a binding step required?  Can 
we show the dataset, and if user selects it, designer will create the binding 
automatically, and if user switch to a different data set, designer 
automatically change the binding?


I selected the data element in the table on which I was setting the hyperlink. I
then went to the binding tab and set the dataset from which the data element was
going to be populated. I saved the report design. I thenk brought up the
expression builder for the hyperlink. It did not include the category for the
BIRT data set. This is not a problem with binding. It seems like the ability to
select from the data set was left out of the expression builder when brought up
in the context of the Hyperlink builder.
I think it is less user friendly if user needs to first bind a dataset to a 
report item, and only after that user can use the dataset to build a hyperlink 
for the report item.  It will be better to show all the datasets in the report 
in the hyperlink builder if no data set were bound to the report item.  If a 
data set is used in the hyperlink, then automatically bind that data set to 
the report item.   But maybe we can have this enhancement in the futre, and 
for now just fix the bug that data set is left out in the hyperlink builder 
even when it is a bound to data report item.
The new hyperlink builder has resolved this problem.

    <WithStack>We have one for wst.common.  Which subproject's got it right, WST or JST?
Nitin, I think this was created when the WST common component became large
enough that an owner was assigned. Is there an owner of the JST common
component? Do several teams contribute to this component?
Since this is a request for a new JST component, I'm changing the component to
JST. Naci can decide if we need a jst.common component.
I opened it merely because it seemed incongruous to not have a component in
Bugzilla when it looks like already we have one in CVS.  I only noticed this
when I opened bug 114671, where the ValidatorMetaData class appears to live in a
jst.common plugin.  Admittedly, it wouldn't appear to have anything in the
milestone plan as of yet, although I wonder if that's because a great many
things just fall into j2ee.  To be clear, I'm not advocating it, I just found it
strange.
FYI - The ValidatorMetaData class is in WST.Validation not a JST common layer. 
What you were noticing is that it makes use of an extended helper to have a
notion  of which folders in a project are output folders and can be ignored so
as to not have duplicate validation messages.

However, we do have jst.common.annotation plugins, jst.common.frameworks, and
jst.common.navigator that it seems like a jst.common component in bugzilla would
be warranted.  None of these have anything to do with J2EE.
Assigning to Naci for comment.
I would recommend closing this as "won't fix" until jst.common is larger. 
Or, until someone has a concrete need.

    <WithStack>Remote log import with a filter from an HP-UX system fails with an error 
message that indicates the adapter file cannot be found.  I'll attache the 
error window that contains the message.  This problem occurs with any log file 
or log file type.  I was using the TPTP 4.1 200510311029 driver.

After debugging this problem I found that this is caused by a change in the 
Agent Controller file transfer functionality.  The log import UI code tries to 
transfer the modified adapter file with filters to the remote machine.  This is 
a temporary file and it doesn't know what OS the remote machine is so it first 
tries to transfer the file to c:\ on the HP machine.  Previously this request 
threw an exception and then the code tried to transfer the file to /tmp, 
assuming the machine was a non-Windows machine.  However, now the transfer to 
c:\ succeeds.  It creates a file like /var/tmp/C:\GLA5668.adapter.  Because the 
UI does not expect this it does not send the parser wrapper on the remote 
machine the correct adapter file name so the parser wrapper fails to find the 
adapter file.  Scott Schneider told me he recently added new functionality that 
was required by the Test Project so a relative path can be specified for the 
target file on the putFile call.  The file transfer server in the Agent 
Controller can then create the transferred file in the system temp directory.

To fix this problem, the Log Import UI can be changed to exploit this new 
functionality.  This new functionality was requested in bugzilla feature 
enhancement 107073 and the intention was to change the log import wizard to use 
it when it is available.  If it is available now we should use it.

Patch to GLAFilterHelper

I tested this patch using 4.1, 4.0, and 3.3 RAC on HP and Windows.  You should
review the messages thrown in case of errors in the new code I added to ensure
correctness.
The patch was verified, modified with some minor message handling changes and 
checked in.
As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant enhancements/defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed. If this enhancement/defect is still unresolved and reproducible in the latest TPTP release (http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/), please re-open.</WithStack>

I switched from flat to hierarchical view in the (unfiltered) problems view.  
I see the tree blink and dance for several seconds as it populates.  It keeps 
scrolling down as the tree fills in and finally scrolls back to the top to 
finish the dance.  Might be nice to use setredraw here to avoid the dancing 
tree.  When switching back to flat, everything is smooth/ok.
This is also because I was expanding the whole tree (which I only do for small
trees in the upcoming build).
We have removed this mode</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I thought one of the nice things you could do with detached views was the
ability to follow along a cheat sheet while performing the steps on the
workbench window, and things like having the tasks view so you can always
add/remove things while working in any dialog.

The problem is that you can't do these things because when a modal dialog takes
focus from the workbench window, it also takes it from the detached view. This
means you have to close the dialog in order to use the detached view.

Can we do it so that you can still work with the detached views while in a modal
dialog?

One of the main assumptions a modal dialog makes is that the world is stable 
while it's up (that's why 'modal' dialogs exist...). What would happen if, 
while the Properties dialog is up for a Java Project, we delete the project 
using a detached Package Explorer??

While I don't think that we can accomodate this particular change we are aware 
that modality as such is a 'bad thing'(tm) and are attempting to reduce its 
impact on the user experience. For example the new Progress / Jobs handling 
mechanism allows for many tasks to be run 'in the background', specifically to 
limit the amount of time 'unavailable' to the User.


Resolution ok.. closing.</WithStack>

Hmm, I'm not really sure ...

When the dialog opens the upper text is empty ... when one clicks on "Finish" 

&lt;Click here to enter a commit comment&gt;

will be inserted into the text.

In this specific state the Finish button should be disabled IMO because one has
to either select or enter a comment -- so there's no way to "finish" other than
providing input.

When the dialog opens the Finish button should be enabled -- I agree with you on
that part :)
Have you tried this? I did and it works as expected (i.e. if you don't enter 
text then no comment is sent to the server. The text you mentioned is a hint 
that you need to enter text but it is not sent to the server).
Using eclipse-SDK-I20051101-0010-win32 I can click on Finish and nothing happens
... will try the latest build tonight.
Now I understand what is going on. There is a option on the preference page 
for allowing empty comments. If it is set to No, then Finish is enabled but 
does nothing. It shoudl definitely be disabled in this case. Soryy about that, 
I forgot that we had the preference.
Forgot about that one too *blush*
I have checked behavior described by Sebastian.
Eclipse 3.3m4 after finish displays continue prompt.
On the prompt there is a checkbox "remember my decision"...

I propose close this bug.
Krzysztof, did you change the preference mentioned in comment 6? The preference is on the Team&gt;CVS preference page in the Connection tab. It's the first preference (Allow empty commit comments). Set that to No and see what happens.
Ok, I understand. 
Please give me the dialog class name and I will try to provide the patch.
It's in the CommitWizard.

    <WithStack>I'm creating a faceted project using ProjectFacetsManager.create(..) and the 
installing the web 2.4 and java 1.4 facets into it. I'm then setting them as 
fixed facets and setting a runtime (tomcat 5.0). The project gets created fine 
but is not recognized as something that can be added to a tomcat 5.0 server. 
The only differences I noticed between the project I created programmtically 
and the ones created by using the New &gt; Web &gt; Dynamic Web Project wizard is in 
the .settings/.component file. The troublesome project has "/src" as the source-
path (instead of "./JavaSource") and the context-root property had no value. I 
manually edited the .settings file and added a value for the context root. I 
was then able to add the project to the server. Even though the source folder 
being different is probably not a problem, I think it would be better if what 
gets set up by default is the same as what the wizard does.


My code is basically doing something like this:

IFacetedProject fproject = ProjectFacetsManager.create(projectName, null, 
monitor_);
IProjectFacetVersion webFacet24 = ProjectFacetsManager.getProjectFacet
("jst.web").getVersion("2.4");
IProjectFacetVersion javaFacet14 = ProjectFacetsManager.getProjectFacet
("jst.java").getVersion("1.4");
Set facetsToAdd = new HashSet();
facetsToAdd.add(webFacet24);
facetsToAdd.add(javaFacet14);
actions = FacetUtils.getInstallActions(facetsToAdd);
        
fproject.modify(actions, monitor_);
        ...
fproject.setFixedProjectFacets(fixedFacets);
        ...
fproject.setRuntime(fRuntime, monitor);
correction: I manually edited the .component file (there is no .settings file)
The WebFacetInstallDelegate does appear to be setting the context-root 
property. I wonder if the setMetaProperty method does not trigger a save.

As far as the src path is concerned, this one is a bit more tricky. The 
jst.java facet is used for all of our projects (except ear) and facet install 
config can only have one default, which is "src". The web project wizard 
changes this to "JavaSource". You can get your code to behave the same way by 
adjusting the property in the jst.java facet's data model. Here is how you 
could do that:

final IDataModel model = (IDataModel) javaFacet14.createActionConfig( 
Action.Type.INSTALL );
model.setStringProperty( 
IJavaFacetInstallDataModelProperties.SOURCE_FOLDER_NAME, "JavaSource" );
final Action action = new Action( Action.Type.INSTALL, javaFacet14, model );

Perhaps we should consider switching to using "src" instead of "JavaSource" for 
web projects to be consistent with other projects...
I changed to /src from /JavaSource and fixed the Context Root problem... closing
this defect now....
With the 1104_0542 I-driver, if we let the Web service wizard create the Web 
project, after the wizard finish, the project is not added to the server.  It 
won't even show up as available choice in the Server -&gt; Add/Remove project pop-
up.  I noticed that the JRE container is missing in the wizard-created Web 
project.  However, even if I go to project properties to manually target it to 
Tomcat 5, the wizard-created Web project would still not show up in the Server -
&gt; Add/Remove project pop-up.

We check the .component file under .settings and noticed that the context-root 
still has no value.  If we manually add the name of the project as the context-
root, then the project shows up on the left-hand side in the Add/Remove project 
to server pop-up.

Rupam, please re-open the defect.

I set a breakpoint at line 108 of WebFacetInstallDelegate.java and examined the 
value of 
model.getStringProperty(IWebFacetInstallDataModelProperties.CONTEXT_ROOT)

When I the create the project programmatically, the value is empty. My facet 
install actions have a null config object so it could just be a problem in the 
default settings.


Chuck,

I tried the 1104_2243I driver which is supposed to have the fix for this 
defect.  It does fix the problem of no value in the context root for 
the .component file in the .settings directory.  However, the wizard-created 
project still cannot be added to the server and does not show up in the Add 
project to server pop-up.

To recreate the problem:

1. Install Tomcat 5 server runtime.
2. Create a Dynamic Web project "a" targetting Tomcat 5.
3. Create a Java file in project "a".  Right-click, select Create Web Service.
4. Select to "generate proxy" and "test".  Press Finish.

This would create a client Web project "aClient".  However, this project cannot 
be added to the project.

We need to find out what's different between this wizard-created project and 
the Web project created using the Dynamic Web project.  
Sending to server component - not sure why this can't be added.
Walked through this in the debugger and found the following:

1) The wizard was extremely slow and had repainting problems. This may partially
be due to the fact that there are about 25 builds and resource change events
(ack!) that occur after pressing finish.

2) The project couldn't be added to the server because web services is passing
in 'null' for the project. I've added a better error message in this case, but
web services is also missing a null check.

3) The null is occuring because the J2EE module factory never realizes that
there is a new module in the workspace. The list of modules is cached and
updated whenever a specific list of files change. The initial problem is that
the facet filename changed, and J2EE appears to require that file to exist. I
channges to org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml to the list of files
to refresh the modules on.

4) Even with this change, the J2EE module factory still isn't recognizing the
project as a Web module. If I touch the resources in the project is does
eventually wake up though.

Chuck - It used to be only the component file that was checked for the existance
of a Web module, but now even after the facets and component files are updated
the factory doesn't recognize the project as a web module. Could this be some
sort of ordering difference when creating the Web module in this case, or is
there another file that you check before accepting the project as a valid web
module?
About (1)... Unfortunately, when using the wizard's progress bar there is no 
way to tell the platform to hold all resource events. See 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=109202. The only way we found to 
work around this is to use the modal progress dialog, which allows AVOID_UPDATE 
flag to be used. This is not just a performance problem. Without holding 
resource events, we get all sorts of intermittent concurrency problems because 
a lot of the code that's responding to the events is not synchronized (or not 
synchronized correctly). I haven't ported the modal progress dialog workaround 
into WTP code base yet. I will do it early this week. Note that it will only 
effect wizards building from AddRemoveFacetsWizard, so wtp wizards will not 
pick up this change until they are converted, which should be later this week.
#1 is now tracked by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=115383.
With the 1105_1946 I-driver plus the latest fix in jst.j2ee, jst.j2ee.core and 
wst.common.modulecore for defect 115190 and 115196, this problem still exist.  
That is, can't add wizard-created project to server.
Dropped to build - need change from Tim as well....
Verified on the I200511090601 build.
Kathy is seeing this again on the I200511110103 build
The problem is showing up again with the 11110103 driver.  If you go through 
the same steps in comment 6, the Web service wizard returns with the error:

"Error occured when adding module, aClient, to the server"

If you cancel from the wizard and check the project properties and select 
server.  You get the message:

"Set the runtime target and the default server for the project.
This project cannot be deployed to a server."

However, if you create another dynamic Web project usin the New dynamic Web 
project wizard, the project now has the proper target.
Has anyone checked whether this is a duplicate of 116010? You can either try the
next build or grab the wst.server.core plugin from HEAD and test with that.
Tried with the latest org.eclipse.wst.server.core plugin in HEAD and I am still 
seeing the problem. Basically, when we call ServerUtil.getModule(project) with 
the newly created project, we're getting back null.
Created attachment 29810
JUnit test that can reproduce the bug

The attachment contains a JUnit test case to cover this problem. This way it
can reproduced without launching the Web service wizard. The test creates a
tomcat 5.0 server, creates a Web project (jst.web 2.4, jst.java 1.4) and then
adds the project to the server. To launch it from a dev. environment, just drop
it into one of your test plugins, fix up the package and run it as a JUnit
plugin test. You'll need to specify your tomcat 5.0 install location in your VM
Arguments when running, like this:
-Dorg.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.50=d:\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28

I verified that the test passes when I200511090601 is my target but fails when
I200511110103 is my target. We might consider adding this to the regular test
bucket once it's working.
Created attachment 29811
Junit test that can reproduce the bug

Made some corrections in the test case.
Ok, my bad. I regressed this with a typo in a change I made in the jst.j2ee code
this week. As a result, it doesn't catch the last resource change event when the
Web facet is added to the project. I've checked in the fix to HEAD.

Chuck - Can you please release the change to J2EEDeployableFactory?

Rupam - Thanks for the testcase. Since you've already gone to the work, let's
make sure this one gets added to the build. I've already got a functionally
identical test, but it works because I don't use the facet API directly (which
changes the ordering that the files are created). Do you want to just add it to
the web services bucket, or do you want me to pick this one up? We could also
simplify it for either the facets or j2ee bucket.
Dropped to build
Verified on 1114_1337 I-build.

Tim, please add this JUnit to your bucket.

Chuck, would you be please consider adding a simplied one to the J2EE bucket as 
well?

identical test, but it works because I don't use the facet API directly (which
changes the ordering that the files are created). Do you want to just add it to
the web services bucket, or do you want me to pick this one up? We could also
simplify it for either the facets or j2ee bucket.
Dropped to build
Verified on 1114_1337 I-build.

Tim, please add this JUnit to your bucket.

Chuck, would you be please consider adding a simplied one to the J2EE bucket as 
well?

    <WithStack>I wasn't doing anything fancy, just renaming one of the 2 projects in the
current workspace, when eclipse crashed with this error message:

(I couldn't cut'n'paste from the window, so I had to type that bloody thing in
btw.. there could be typos)

The renaming process was running when it happened.
Running eclipse 3.2 with the TruStudio foundation add-on, for php.
Also running azureus, which is another java program also using javaw.exe.

I figured I'd post a bug report just in case it means something to any of you.. ;-)

Here's the VM log:

Right!
The code base has changed significantly since this bug was reported.  If it is still happening for you, please reopen this bug report.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I wasn't doing anything fancy, just renaming one of the 2 projects in the
current workspace, when eclipse crashed with this error message:

(I couldn't cut'n'paste from the window, so I had to type that bloody thing in
btw.. there could be typos)

The renaming process was running when it happened.
Running eclipse 3.2 with the TruStudio foundation add-on, for php.
Also running azureus, which is another java program also using javaw.exe.

I figured I'd post a bug report just in case it means something to any of you.. ;-)

    <WithStack>From time to time we need to refactor plugins and move extension points.  
Since extension points derive their identity from that of their containing 
plugin, moving implies a rename.  The old ext pt must be left behind for 
compatibility and the accessing code updated to read both the old and new ext 
pts when looking for extensions.

Having done this, it would be nice to be able to deprecate the old extension 
point definition and give developers a chance to update their extensions to 
use the new extension point.

The deprecation indication could go in the schema though it is unclear that 
this is shipped in the runtime builds of plugins.  Alternatively it could be 
an additional attribute on the extension point markup itself.  In either case, 
PDE UI would be updated ot have this notion and add the appropriate 
error/warning markers in the plugin.xml files.  Of course, quick fixes would 
be optimal. :-)
I think the deprecation information should be strictly in the schema.  In 
fact, we already support it: Just mark the 'extension' element in the schema 
as deprecated in the property sheet.

The warning issued by PDE for using a deprecated extension should be improved 
though.  We now issue a generic warning about deprecated 'elements'.

Janek, keep this one in mind as we redesign the schema editor.  We should 
allow people to specify the extension point that should be used instead of the 
deprecated one.
Extensions can be flagged as deprecated in the new schema editor, a suggested replacement extension can also be specified.
Deprecated extensions will now get an appropriate warning/error in the plugin editor.</WithStack>

From bug 280176:

If we do something here, we should support generating correct Javadoc, including @param and @return tags.

This would need 2 new code template variables, e.g.

- {@field_javadoc_summary}: For use in main description of getter and setter. Extracts the first sentence as specified here: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#leadingasterisks

- {@field_javadoc_tag_summary}: For use after @return and @param tags. Extracts the first sentence, removes the dot at the end and makes the first character lowercase

To see where the implementation would go, see references to 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.template.java.CodeTemplateContextType.BARE_FIELD_NAME</WithStack>

Code assist can be picky about when completion is available. 

It could be improved in the following scenario (pretty common and frustrating
for users used to VS where this is available (so i'm told))

class A{
  void foo(){
     Collections.&lt;CODEASSIST&gt;
  }
}

Because it's activated _after_ the dot, code assist is not available here and
only beeps sadly.

However, delete the dot and do code assist again and the import appears. _Then_
you can type the dot, and code assist will give you the list of completions you
expect. 

Essentially, to do what I want I have to do code assist twice when once should
be enough.
Inline with current work.

    <WithStack>None of the file comparision seems to use the syntax coloring already available

Both Netbeans and JBuilder use syntax coloring for file comparision for any file
type. This makes it so much more readable.

Can we please enhance this in Eclipse.
What do you mean with file comparison ?

I checked the synchronize view and compare for Java files and both use syntax
coloring, however not semantic coloring.
I am not sure what you mean by semantic coloring. 

I am refering to Syntax coloring not being used for property files and xml files
when you compare two files via CVS/Team actions or Local History/Compare actions.






It is the responsibility of the provider of the XML editor to provide the proper
extension to compare. Otherwise compare can't know how to color the files.

Can you please open a PR against the plug-in you are using for editing XML
files. I am forwarding this to text to take care of the properties file where
they contribute the editor for.
I have raised bug 114990 for WTP for xml and html file comparison.
(In reply to comment #2)
&gt; I am not sure what you mean by semantic coloring. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am refering to Syntax coloring not being used for property files and xml files

Properties files work fine for me in 3.2 M3. Please provide accurate steps on
how to reproduce. See also

http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-text-home/development/bug-incomplete.htm


We are still using 3.2M2.

Will check against 3.2M3.
I think the problem is with the property file name and how it is associated.
All well known names that come with eclipse works fine.

If it is a different name like xyz.props and associated via content-type to the
properties file editor it works.

If it is associated via file-association it does not work for "file
comparisions" although it opens with the property-file-editor correctly.

Is this a bug ? Should we reopen it ?

Compare is not related to the editor itself and hence associating an editor to a
file extension or content type has no effect at all on comparing stuff.
Comparing content depends on registered file patterns or content types and can
currently not be controlled via UI.

(In reply to comment #2)
&gt; I am not sure what you mean by semantic coloring. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am refering to Syntax coloring not being used for property files and xml files

Properties files work fine for me in 3.2 M3. Please provide accurate steps on
how to reproduce. See also

http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-text-home/development/bug-incomplete.htm


We are still using 3.2M2.

Will check against 3.2M3.
I think the problem is with the property file name and how it is associated.
All well known names that come with eclipse works fine.

If it is a different name like xyz.props and associated via content-type to the
properties file editor it works.

If it is associated via file-association it does not work for "file
comparisions" although it opens with the property-file-editor correctly.

Is this a bug ? Should we reopen it ?

Compare is not related to the editor itself and hence associating an editor to a
file extension or content type has no effect at all on comparing stuff.
Comparing content depends on registered file patterns or content types and can
currently not be controlled via UI.

Deferred from 4.1 as per decision made at Platform project meeting (11/2/05)
This is a P3 and time has run out.  Deferring to 4.2.1.
Changing milestone to 4.3 since 4.2.1 has been changed to only major approved
defect fixes.

Changing target to 4.4, since 4.3 is closed except for blocking or critical defects.
Adding estimate.  Target should be 4.4i1, Target Milestone not available for setting at the moment.

I think this may have already been completed.
Setting Target Milestone to 4.4i1.
Created attachment 61318
Patch to fix defect 114694

Patch for the following plugins:

org.eclipse.hyades.execution
org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution
I created a patch for the following plugins:

org.eclipse.hyades.execution
org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution

Note that references to com.ibm remain, but these are not in comments and are needed, since they are references to com.ibm.icu.

I will need to get Joe, Paul, or someone else to deliver this fix, since I am not a committer on platform. 
(In reply to comment #8)

Assign to the componet owner for check-in.

Assigning to Joanna [component owner]

Deferred from 4.1 as per decision made at Platform project meeting (11/2/05)
This is a P3 and time has run out.  Deferring to 4.2.1.
Changing milestone to 4.3 since 4.2.1 has been changed to only major approved
defect fixes.

Changing target to 4.4, since 4.3 is closed except for blocking or critical defects.
Adding estimate.  Target should be 4.4i1, Target Milestone not available for setting at the moment.

I think this may have already been completed.
Setting Target Milestone to 4.4i1.
Created attachment 61318
Patch to fix defect 114694

Patch for the following plugins:

org.eclipse.hyades.execution
org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution
I created a patch for the following plugins:

org.eclipse.hyades.execution
org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution

Note that references to com.ibm remain, but these are not in comments and are needed, since they are references to com.ibm.icu.

I will need to get Joe, Paul, or someone else to deliver this fix, since I am not a committer on platform. 
(In reply to comment #8)

Assign to the componet owner for check-in.

Assigning to Joanna [component owner]
(In reply to comment #8)

I have reviewed these changes and they are ready for check-in.

Looks like the string is contained in the resource.h files. Since the new AC (src-native-new) is pulling this code unchanged from the RAC (src-native), need to eliminate it from the RAC code (and we will delete the copy of that src from the AC code-base after making some changes in the build of the new AC). 
See bug 125510 and bug 132019
