    <WithStack>find in scope expands the selection automatically to full lines
so I'm not the only one that is confused about this. See also comment in 11820
I changed the scope labels to 'All' and 'Selected Lables'.
'selected lines', i hope
yup ;-)
Reassigning to JDT/Text since code ownership has changed

With single click launching on, click the debug button

An "incorrect usage" dump from the VM appears in the console.
The launch config dialog should open with the new config showing the error 
condition - i.e. no main method.
Fixed in JavaMainTab.  We where setting the main type name to be "" when there 
was no main type name.
Please verify.
Running the test case, I see an error dialog that must be dismissed, then the launch configuration 
dialog comes in an error state.  Do we need the error dialog if the config dialog is in an error state?
I would say that we do not need the error dialog.  Does this generalize when 
not single click launching?  What about the other abort cases...I believe they 
all show an error dialog as well.
Error dialog no longer appears.  Launch config dialog comes up in correct error state as expected.

The third page of the new (capabilities) project wizard has an enabled next 
button and a disabled finish button. This leads me to believe that there is 
another page. Instead, when I press next the project is created. The finish 
button should be enabled instead of the next button on this last page.

OS: RedHat Linux 7.2 using the Motif window system

Description:
I can't access the system menus (or any menus for that matter) using the
keyboard.  If a java editor has the focus, F10, Shift+F10, Ctrl+F10, and
Ctrl+Shift+F10 have no effect.  Also, Alt+F does not drop down the file menu as
expected -- instead it inserts a lower-case f in my java code.  (I can't open
any menus with Alt+&lt;Mnemonic&gt;.)  I can, however, do things like hit Ctrl+B to
invoke a build.  I have the same problems in views.
This is the Num-lock problem. 
It shouldn't be. The num-lock problem has been fixed.
I tried it on Ian's machine. With num-lock on accelerator did not work. Turning 
num-lock off accelerator did work. 
Argh. Grant, is this a regression?

This is a different case of the famous NumLock problem.  It was previously 
fixed for accelerators, but in this case it's causing problems for mnemonics.  
All that we can do is give The XmNmnemonic resource a KeySym as a value, after 
which the platform runs the show w.r.t. activating the menu item 
appropriately.  I'm not sure what to do here.  Will troll for assistance...

Removing accessibility keyword since the numlock problem doesn't block 
accessibility (it's just very annoying).

    <WithOutStack>Build: 20020319

OS: RedHat Linux 7.2 using the Motif window system

Description:
I can't access the system menus (or any menus for that matter) using the
keyboard.  If a java editor has the focus, F10, Shift+F10, Ctrl+F10, and
Ctrl+Shift+F10 have no effect.  Also, Alt+F does not drop down the file menu as
expected -- instead it inserts a lower-case f in my java code.  (I can't open
any menus with Alt+&lt;Mnemonic&gt;.)  I can, however, do things like hit Ctrl+B to
invoke a build.  I have the same problems in views.
This is the Num-lock problem. 
It shouldn't be. The num-lock problem has been fixed.
I tried it on Ian's machine. With num-lock on accelerator did not work. Turning 
num-lock off accelerator did work. 
Argh. Grant, is this a regression?

Color problem is handled by not drawing the banner image if the background is

Size issue is related to the fact that PDE is 'misusing' banner font in places 
where a bold version of the default font is required. This works well in the

    <WithStack>Right now, if you click on something on the bookshelf, the navigation frame 
switches to its TOC, but the content frame is blank. This is a good spot for 
products to put some sort of branding splash, or better yet a description of 
what's in the book, tips for using their documentation (e.g., how the TOC is 
organized, etc), links to critical introductory topics, etc.

This is functionality we did have in V1, and we used it a lot. When the user 
selected a new infoset, they got info on how the nav trees were organized, etc.

Suggestion: In plugin.xml, for tocs that have been designated as primary=true, 
allow an href="xxxx.htm" attribute, as shown:

   &lt;extension point="org.eclipse.help.toc"&gt;
       &lt;toc file="toc.xml" primary="true" href="intro.htm" /&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;

This means there's no change to the toc DTD, and it closely associates the 
topic with the primary-ness of the toc.

If this primary toc were to be pulled into another toc, so that it no longer 
appears on the bookshelf, the intro.htm would no longer be seen -- this is fine.
This sounds like a good idea. Hopefully we will have a chance to do it in 2.0
The next nightly build (20020417) should support the function you want, in a 
slightly different manner:

In a toc.xml file, you can set a "topic" attribute on a &lt;toc&gt; and the value is 
the url of description topic of the toc.

&lt;toc label="PDE Guide" topic="overview/toc.html"&gt;
   &lt;topic label="Tasks"  href="tasks/intro.html"/&gt;
   ....
&lt;/toc&gt;

Please give it a try and add a comment here if works as you expect.
marking as fixed.

It works as expected. Thanks.
One question: Why not call the attribute "href" instead of "topic"; that would 
be more consistent with the other elements in toc files?
We consider the href of a TOC to be the actual toc.xml file, so using an href 
attribute would confuse matters. On the other hand, for someone who's only 
contributing docs and does not call help API's (we expose IToc, ITopic, etc), 
using the href attribute makes more sense.

I would like to revisit the choice of attribute (topic vs. href), so consider 
the feature implemented, but it's DTD not stable until M6 (when the feature is 
targeted).</WithStack>

3.  Release the mouse button.
4.  There is a black border around the 'X' that shouldn't be there.

This will be the case for all toolbar items.  It just indicates that the item 
has focus.  If you hit enter when the black border is present you will trigger

Wrong thing is pasted when double-clicking a proposal before any other
interaction with the proposal table.  The first proposal is pasted when
another proposal is double-clicked.  If a proposal is selected first (mouse
or down arrow), the problem does not happen.  This problem was first
noticed after migrating to Workbench 2.0.  The same code worked fine on
Workbench 1.0.

            if (p != null)
                  insertProposal(p, (char) 0, fViewer.getSelectedRange
().x);
      }

2. Put printlns in Table.java (3 select() methods) to see if the Table
select methods were ever sent.

sample output:

1 - select2
2 - selection - TableItem {call programName;}
3 - select2
4 - default - TableItem {call programName;}
5 - 0
6 - insert - add record on exception statements end;


1 - Table.select().  This happens when the table first comes up.  The first
item in the table is selected
2 - When double-clicking on an item (not the first one), first I get
selection notification for the correct selection (The one I double-clicked
on)
3 - the item is selected in the Table
4 - the default (double-click) is recognized.  Still the selection is
correct
5 - getSelectedProposal() is called.  The index is wrong here!!!  No
noticeable select() methods executed in Table.
6 - wrong proposal is inserted!!!
Cannot reproduce on 20020404. Pls check.</WithStack>

Wrong thing is pasted when double-clicking a proposal before any other
interaction with the proposal table.  The first proposal is pasted when
another proposal is double-clicked.  If a proposal is selected first (mouse
or down arrow), the problem does not happen.  This problem was first
noticed after migrating to Workbench 2.0.  The same code worked fine on
Workbench 1.0.  

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. put printlns in 
org.eclipse.jface.text.contentassistCompletionProposalPopup.java 
(workbenchsrc.zip)

      private void createProposalSelector() {
                  .
                  .
                  .
            fProposalTable.addSelectionListener(new SelectionListener() {
                  public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e) {
==&gt;               System.out.println("selection - " + e.item.toString());
                  }

                  public void widgetDefaultSelected(SelectionEvent e) {
==&gt;                     System.out.println("default - " + e.item.toString
());
                        insertSelectedProposal();
                        hide();
                  }
            });

      private ICompletionProposal getSelectedProposal() {
            int i= fProposalTable.getSelectionIndex();
==&gt;                     System.out.println(i);
            if (i &lt; 0 || i &gt;= fFilteredProposals.length)
                  return null;
            return fFilteredProposals[i];
      }

      private void insertSelectedProposal() {
            ICompletionProposal p= getSelectedProposal();
==&gt;         System.out.println("insert - " + ((ICompletionProposal)
p).getDisplayString());
            if (p != null)
                  insertProposal(p, (char) 0, fViewer.getSelectedRange
().x);
      }

2. Put printlns in Table.java (3 select() methods) to see if the Table
select methods were ever sent.

sample output:

1 - select2
2 - selection - TableItem {call programName;}
3 - select2
4 - default - TableItem {call programName;}
5 - 0
6 - insert - add record on exception statements end;


1 - Table.select().  This happens when the table first comes up.  The first
item in the table is selected
2 - When double-clicking on an item (not the first one), first I get
selection notification for the correct selection (The one I double-clicked
on)
3 - the item is selected in the Table
4 - the default (double-click) is recognized.  Still the selection is
correct
5 - getSelectedProposal() is called.  The index is wrong here!!!  No
noticeable select() methods executed in Table.
6 - wrong proposal is inserted!!!

    <WithStack>I performed the following steps.
1. Stated up Eclipse build I20020319
2. Imported binary plugins (except team)
3. Checked out Team plugins from CVS
4. Tested for a day or so
5. Made some change to one of the Team plugins and tried to debug using PDE 
launcher.

The code I was debugging did not match the code in my workspace. I rebuild the 
project and restarted several times. It appears that the code from my plugins 
directory was run. The only way I could debug was to slam my changes into my 
plugins directory!
I also had the same problem on Win98 with build 2002-03-19.

- I made changes to the code in my workspace (added a System.out.println call) 
but nothing was going to the console
- I added a breakpoint to the method and the breakpoint was hit but when I 
stepped over it nothing was printed to the console (and I believe the step over 
stepped 2 lines)

Is the code being run the code in the dev rather than the workspace?

The workaround is to go to PDE 'Target Platform' preference page and disable 
all the external plug-ins. They are causing the problem because the model 
synchronizer that should prevent the appearance of 'twins' is not working 
properly. 
Fixed - was caused by stale model objects due to lack of Core resource 
notification.</WithStack>

Setting my launch config as the default for the "exe" extension cleared up the 
second part of the problem.  It appears that each extension must have a default, 
which may not always be the case.
Joe, please take a look at this one to determine if we have a low risk fix for 
milestone 4.
Problem (1) was due to not handling editors that weren't in the editor registry.  Now, file 
extensions that don't map to an editor use the image for the default editor.

Problem (2) was 
due to the lack of a default config type for a file extension.

There was also a third problem, 
also due to no default being set.  This occurred when user clicked OK and the defaults were 
saved.

Fixes made in debug-milestone-4 branch &amp; in HEAD stream.
Please verify.

Description:
If I expand a fast view to take up most of the screen, and then minimize it, as
the fast view scrolls across the screen, it leaves behind the right edge.  Once
the scrolling is finished, the screen cleans itself up, but while the view is
scrolling, it's very ugly.  The code that runs the scrolling is in
org.eclipse.ui.internal.Perspective and is as follows:

private void hideFastView(IViewPart part) {
	// Get pane.
	ViewPane pane = getPane(part);

	// Hide the right side sash first
	if (fastViewSash != null)
		fastViewSash.setBounds(0, 0, 0, 0);
	
	// Slide it off screen.
	Rectangle bounds = pane.getBounds();
	Control ctrl = pane.getControl();
	for (int nX = 0; nX &lt;= bounds.width; nX += 50) {
		ctrl.setLocation(-nX, bounds.y);
		ctrl.getParent().update();
	}

	// Hide it completely.
	pane.setBounds(0, 0, 0, 0);
	pane.setFastViewSash(null);
	ctrl.setEnabled(false); // Remove focus support.
}
Not a bug. This is working as expected on the platform.

I spoke with the implementor of fast views about this and suggested that they 
avoid using the animation on platforms other than windows.

Duplicate - this has been fixed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The tabs on the editor windows use the background colour and text colour of the 
java editor for thier disabled colours. They should use the same colours as the 
views when disabled.

STEPS
1) Set your windows settings to high contrast black when all others are the 
defaults
2) Open an Eclipse with an editor open
3) Remove focus from the editor. The text will be black as will the back ground 
of the tab
4) Reset to windows standard and set your window background colour to blue. The 
tab will be blue, not gray (like the Views) on deselection.
The problem is actually different - we were slamming the color of the text 
foreground to be black  - this is wrong in high contrast blank. As the editor 
gradient is based on the list background color I changed the text color to be 
the list foreground color.

    <WithStack>Maybe this is caused by PDE's launch config?
Moving to PDE UI.
Some more detail?
1. Start an Eclipse Run-time workbench via running man icon drop down -&gt; Run
Configurations...
2. Start to add a new config (running man icon drop down -&gt; Run Configurations...
3. Press "New"
4. Enter all the relevant data
5. Try to save your data:
==&gt; Dialog says "You must close the...". Apply is disabled
(dialog said that before but I assumed this is only important if I want to launch)

BTW: Why is this restriction that I can not launch two workspaces which are at
separate locations (-data X, -data Y, Y != X)? I could always do that with the
old launcher.


Sigh... Another glitch from moving from a wizard to a launch configuration...

You should be able to save the configuration, but not launch it. In the past,
PDE checked for running workbench in the first wizard page, and it appears that 
the logic has been broken when moving to the launch configurations.

The code prevents you to launch two instances to avoid ugly red dump on the 
console when trying to launch two platforms on the same workspace. I agree that 
you can launch any number of instances on different workspaces, but having two 
instances of Eclipse (design-time and run-time) is confusing enough for 
developers. At a minimum, I would like to provide a switch somewhere so that 
you must explicitly enable this mode (with all the consequences).
The launchers have been redesigned to allow editing the config while the 
instance it running. In addition, bookkeeping of running instances has been 
extended to keep track of different workspaces. The error dialog will now be 
shown only if a second attempt has been made to launch the run-time workbench 
on the same data. Having two or more instances with different workspaces is OK 
now.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If I define my plugin name to be something like %Plugin.name so that the real 
name is seperated for translation, when I look at the manifest with the editors 
i see the string %Plugin.name.  This is not such a big deal for plugin names 
but it happens for every string I seperate which make some of the pages pretty 
hard to use.  

It would be really nice if the pde externilized the strings for you since it 
should always be done anyway. ( Or at least provide an option to externilize 
the strings for the user )
Are you sure this is not working? Open any binary project in your workspace and 
open plugin.xml in the PDE manifest editor. Notice how 'Plug-in Name' field 
shows properties entry with a'%' but the title shows the translated name loaded 
from the properties. 

I guess PDE didn't update the title quickly enough. If it is not a typo (the 
key after the % does not match the entry in plugin.properties), PDE should use 
the translated name everywhere.
The title is shown resolved correctly.  I was commenting on the fact that 
the 'Plug-in Name' field contained the '%'.  I actually hadn't noticed that 
other, not mispelled, items were being resolved correctly.  I was really hoping 
that the text in the 'Plug-in Name' field WOULD be resolved, and the properties 
file would change if I changed the field.
That would be way too much magic :-). 

I think that NL issues should be handled consistently for the entire SDK. JDT 
has a string externalization tool for Java code, so we should try to be 
consistent.

For now, I would stick with the current mix of explicit entry (with %) in 
editable fields and translated names wherever that property appears in the UI. 
It also help spot the typos (you see % in the UI as well). Automatic NL-ing 
would be hard because PDE would have to automatically come up with keys (JDT 
does that but I don't like the keys they generate).</WithStack>

You will get a dialog with the following error:
Problem while importing plugin org.eclipse.ui. Could not set the project 
description for org.eclipse.ui. because the .project file is out of sync with 
the file system.
This looks like a Core bug. The project is first deleted (with the contents). 
Then the new description is created for the project, project is created and 
content is copied into it. WHen the new description is set to the project, it 
complains that .project file is out of sync. It cannot be out of sync when it 
was never there - the project has just been created.

Tips for debugging: 

Place a breakpoint in PDE's ImportOperation.createProject(...) and follow the 
scenario below. The problem sequence is:

IProject project = root.getProject(name);
if (project.exists()) {
   if (queryReplace(project)) {
	boolean deleteContent =
	doImport &amp;&amp; root.getLocation().isPrefixOf(project.getLocation());
	project.delete(deleteContent, true, new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 1));
   } else {
	return;
   }
} else {
   monitor.worked(1);
}

IProjectDescription desc =
   root.getWorkspace().newProjectDescription(project.getName());
if (!doImport) {
   desc.setLocation(pluginPath);
}
project.create(desc, new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 1));
if (!project.isOpen()) {
   project.open(null);
}

   if (doImport) {
	importContent(
		pluginDir,
		project.getFullPath(),
		FileSystemStructureProvider.INSTANCE,
		null,
		new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 1));
	} else {
		monitor.worked(1);
	}
        desc = project.getDescription();
	desc.setNatureIds(new String[] { JavaCore.NATURE_ID, PLUGIN_NATURE });
---&gt;	project.setDescription(desc, new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 1)); 
Here is what happens:

- first project is created in a user-specified location
- first project is deleted (delete contents = false)
- another project is created in the default area
  - this creates a new .project file
- the import tool deletes the .project file 
(ImportOperation.ensureTargetDoesNotExist)
- the import tool imports the content, including existing .project file from the 
source project
- the import tool calls setDescription, which throws an exception because the 
.project file has been replaced from underneath it (by the delete and recreate)

Fixed.  With the new way of listening to changes to .project, the .project file 
that gets imported is discovered immediately, so it is not reported as out 
of sync when setDescription is called.</WithStack>

Steps:
1. Open a plugin.xml file (it opens in the Plugin Manifest editor)
2. Go to the Dependencies page
3. Set focus on the "Find:" combo box under the heading Dependency Status
4. Press Tab or Ctrl+Tab

You can't tab out of the combo box except by backwards-tabbing with Shift+Tab.
This looks like a custom combo box behaviour. 

Moving to SWT for comments. The question is:

Why is custom combo box (CCombo) trapping keyboard when the focus enters the 
text field part of the custom control?
*** Bug 13937 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
PR was moved to SWT, but owner was not updated, so I did not see it. VI to fix.
Fixed for M6 20020418-I

The CCOmbo code expected that Tab would be used for default selection.  I 
checked and Combo does not use Tab for default selection so I am not sure why 
CCombo did but this has been removed and traversal now occurs on Tab/Ctrl Tab.

    <WithStack>When you connect to a repository has the message "connecting to" but does not 
say who it is. It should be "Connecting to ottcvs1" or something like that.
I'm sure this is a duplicate PR but can't find it.
I've look all over the place for this but have not found it
yet.  Do you remember which connection method you were using
at the time?  (pserver, extssh, ext)

I was using extssh
Did it happen to be a repository with a very long location string?
The progress monitor dialog does not seem to handle word wrap quite right.
Printing long text strings can result in the last word being clipped.

I am guessing the precise message you saw was: "Opening connection to".
[Impl. detail: the displayed from CVSRepositoryLocation.openConnection()]

Another place you can see this effect is while using the Checkout As action in 
the CVS Repositories view.  Try typing in project names of varying lengths then 
look at the task name in the progress monitor dialog that appears.

Forwarding to Kevin McGuire for comments.

It was to ottcvs1 with the path /home/cvs/desktop. However it appeared to not 
be clipped but to not have the text at all.
Sorry I was unclear.  It appears that the progress monitor dialog tries to wrap 
the last word onto a new line but does not allocate enough vertical space in 
the layout for it to be visible there.  Therefore the label is clipped 
vertically and the wrapped word is not shown.

I have had difficulty reproducing the problem while opening connections to CVS 
servers (and the code looks alright) so I am guessing based on behaviour I 
observed during Checkout As.

The message will only be visible if you perform certain actions.  Which action 
did you run to cause this to happen?

I was doing a Synchronize with Stream IIRC
Alternate way to reproduce:
In the CVS Repositories view:
  - right-click &amp; select New Repository Location
  - choose any connection method
  - enter some _long_ junk text in the remaining fields
  - ensure 'Validate connection on Finish' is checked.
  - hit Ok, watch closely
    [Alternately, add a breakpoint at the beginning of Connection.open()]

Checkout As exhibits similar behaviour.
Cannot reproduce with Syncronize With Stream.

The specified message discussed above will only be visible when no
enclosing progress monitor has specified a task name in beginTask().

The problem will likely occur whenever a progress monitor dialog is
requested to display any very long task name.

Reassigning to UI component.

Not critical for M6.
The error message in the progress monitor dialog was specifically designed to 
only have one line. If you wish to give very logn error messages you will 
always get the end cut off.

Here are some steps now

1) Select a project
2) Check out as long long text is not good for the progress monitor as it 
takes up all of the room
3) Select another project
4) Check out as long long text is not good for the progress monitor as it 
takes up all of the room
5) You will see the collision message gets truncated.

Exact steps to reproduce:

1) Go to q:\viper\team\rperetti\JARS
2) unzip testFramework.zip to somewhere on your hard-disk
3) Use plugin import tool to import xalan and junit fragments

Those plugins somehow get the CVS nature attached.  When you try to go to the

    <WithStack>It is not possible to edit a CVS repository location so if you make a mistake 
you are stuck creating a new one which is a real pain considering how much 
information is required. Also it would be nice if the delete key would do a 
Discard Location.
Edit: this might be a duplicate PR
Delete: might also (at least, I know its annoyed me too :)  )

Editing and "Apply"ing the change to CVS reposisitory information somehow 
removes all the repository from the list.
I'm not seeing this in 2.0.  I've tried changing the connection method, and the 
user name.  In both cases I asked it to modify the existing projects using that 
location.
I see, it disappears if you have no projects that use it.  I've entered bug 
21919 for that.  Bernard, feel free to add yourself to the CC.

Wrt original bug report:
- at present you can edit many of the fields.  Some you cannot because of 
technical issues but may be possible with a lot of work (changing them in 
effect invalidates the sync info).

- delete key still doesn't work in 2.0

Getting the active workbench window can only be achieved from the correct 
thread...the UI thread in this case.
This is interesting... we will prompt the user to find source, and they will 
have no clue why we are doing it...
Need java debug core util for resolving java elements in a given project, based 
on type names (stack frames). This could be used by HCR manager, AST engine, 
and breakpoint utils.
I only did the simple fix, which is to have the UI source locator prompt in the 
UI thread. This will suffice for 2.0. Suggest to verify, and then defer for 
post 2.0 consideration (i.e. we could use status handlers, etc., to better 
explain to the user why we are looking for source).


Please verify.
Verified that current implementation works for 2.0. Reopening to resolve as 
later.
Deferring.

Re-evaluate post-2.0.
Resolving to later.
This is the old source lookup framework. Closing.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

Fixed.
I still see the bug in 20020404:

Simple do "Compare with Revision" on a file which has more than one entry then
click on the table header.

    <WithStack>If you have a plugin in your workspace that also exists in
the external environment, then by default the PDE should enable
the one in your workspace and disable the external one
when launching a runtime workbench.  Currently the user must
manually disable the external plugin.

Not doing this by default may cause the user to see
NoClassDefFoundExceptions or similar cryptic errors during launching
since they may be running against stale code in the external
environment.
There is already a model synchronizer in place that should maintain single-plug-
in visibility depending on the state of the workspace. However, it has been 
added recently and is still fragile. There are still a number of scenarios 
that 'full' it, resulting in 'twin' plug-ins being simultaneously visible.
Fixed now. Masked external plug-ins (those that have workspace 'twins') are not 
enabled in the launcher.</WithStack>

Using the selfhosting launcher, either in run or debug mode, my .class files 
are not being picked up, it seems its taking the jars from the development 
environment's plugin directory.  The source lookup is correct, its just the 
wrong class files are being executed.

We've seen this from several members of the team.  This has resulted in 
considerable lost time, scratching heads trying to debug code that isn't 
actually being run.

Required plugins had been previously reimported, using the "copy contents" 
option.  I've heard rumours that not using this option yields working self-
hosting.
The model synchronizer is not working properly, resulting in external plug-ins 
being visible when identical plug-ins are present in the workspace.

As a short-term fix, go to 'Preferences-&gt;Plug-in Development-&gt;Target Platform' 
and deselect all the plug-ins there. This will restrict PDE visibility to 
workspace only. 
Fixed - was caused by stale model objects due to lack of Core resource 
notification.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Build 20020319

Deleting a project does not send a PRE_DELETE resource delta event any longer.
Same when moving a project.

Note that JDT core heavily relies on this event.
Workspace notification for projects was accidently removed during refactoring of
resource move and delete. Will fix.
Also ensure that it is added to the project.move cases.

Review all cases:
- name change
- case change 
- content area change &lt;- not needed here since the resource is not changing in 
the tree

Fixed. Test cases written.
Awaiting review before release.
Released into HEAD.
Available in builds &gt; 2002-03-20.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I'm running Eclipse 2.0 gtk1 (20020319) using Sun's sdk 1.4.0 on a RH7.2 system
with Greek Locale support (ISO-8859-7).

When I'm changing my font properties for java source editing, the default GTK
font selection dialog appears with localized (greek) messages where possible
(this was not the behaviour with previous gtk builds). This is not the correct
behaviour since my locale settings are the following:


[fsla@javabean fsla]$ locale

LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1
LC_CTYPE=el_GR.ISO-8859-7
LC_NUMERIC=en_US.ISO-8859-1
LC_TIME=en_US.ISO-8859-1
LC_COLLATE=en_US.ISO-8859-1

LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.ISO-8859-1"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.ISO-8859-1"

(ie: only the LC_TYPE is set to ISO-8859-7).

The part that bugs me is the "didn't happen on previous build", because there 
was no change in any relevant part of SWT between the two builds.  Will 
investigate, and the fix is going into the 2.0 stream.
GG, please see if this is fixed by GTK 2.0.  Thanks.
Fixed ;)

Yes. Do as part of your perspective rework. 
These are going to go away as soon as the new way of creating projects becomes 
real. At the end of the project creation, you'll be presented with the option 
of what you want to do. Since the user can add multiple capabilities, there 
could be multiple perspectives that the user could select from. We are still 
looking how to best approach this problem...either way, the preferences are 
going away.
Given these are not going to go away for release 2.0 it seems (because the

    <WithStack>GdbPicl needs to be enhanced to filter gdb input/ouput and program input/output 
properly.  EPDC protocol has been changed so that CommandLog is returned to UI 
as changed packets instead of return strings.  What this means is that GdbPicl 
can send in program output and gdb responses after all requests instead of 
waiting for a command Log request.  GdbPicl needs to implement these change 
packets after all requests.

EPDC also has changes to allow user to provide program input.  Program input 
requests come in like halt request.  GdbPicl also need to add implementation to 
handle this request.
Put all output to GDB Console for now.
GDB does not allow me to filter out what is produced by the program or
what is produced by GDB.
I have submitted bug onto frogger (bug 135) to handle
big output from program.

1) In the help contents the Bookshelf bar does not use the system, colours - it 
is always white on blue
2) The Bookshelf title is invisible if the text colour in white (like in High 
Contrast Black)
3) The widget for the tree uses a fixed size font - it does not become extra 
large when the windows settings are High Contrast White Extra Large
4) All help has a white background and black text. However IE has the same 
issue so it might not be our problem.
5) Search view does not respect large font settings
6) All tabs use a small font and should us a n appropriate system font
We are working on a completely redesigned help ui that picks up the system 
colours (and also has a different L&amp;F).
It will be in a driver as soon as it gets ported on some of the other browsers 
(Mozilla, etc.)
BTW, we have not closed on the font issue. 
The design was done with Tahoma 8pts, but your observations are valid, and we 
should think about picking up system settings (perhaps adjusted by a certain 
proportion).

I will close this, as colour problems are fixed, and opened #12654 to track the 
font issues.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>The up and down keystrokes are ignored by the Bookshelf view which means you 
are forced to use the mouse.
Arrows don't work (yet), but you can tab and hit enter.
We hope to have a fix for getting arrows to work; currently tabs are what the 
browser supports by default (help is implemented using html).
Default browser support for keyboard navigation uses the arrows for scrolling.
I am not sure we should override browser's behavior, but it can certainly be 
done.
If they are just regular links, then you should stick with Tab since that is 
standard for a web browser.
As long as there is some way of accessing them, we're OK for accessibility.
For usability, though, it should match the user's expectations.
That is, if they think it's a web browser, it should work like a web browser.
If it looks like a regular app, it should work like a regular app.
The problem with Help using an embedded web browser is that it may be unclear 
to the user whether it's a web browser or a regular app.

Help can be used in other non-eclipse scenarios (standalone and 
infoceter/server-based), so in some cases it is clear this is a browser app.

The next build will have support for associating a default topic to a book 
(i.e. a TOC). We should also have "welcome" kind of page for the help bookshelf 
as well. 

Perhaps we can use these pages to provide a quick introduction to the help 
features, accessibility included.

The major problem right now is getting focus inside the help content. 
See http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12398

    <WithStack>Moving a project using IProject.move(IPath, ...) instead
of IProject.move(IProjectDescription, ...) discards the existing
project description during the move.

Why doesn't IProject.move(IPath, ...) just result in something like:
  IProjectDescription desc = project.getDescription();
  desc.setName(path.lastSegments(1));
  project.move(desc, ...);

Is this new behaviour?  I had code written using the IPath version
that broke after the pre-M4 integration build.
For projects, IResource.move(IPath,...) is spec'd (in 1.0 and 2.0) to use a new
description with the new project name. However, it was implemented in 1.0 to
pick up the old description and change the name (and set location back to
default).

We will need to investigate how we want it to work and how to do this without
breaking everyone.
Changed spec to reflect implementation in 1.0 where we use the source 
description in the destination. 

Change implementation to follow new spec.

If a project has unresolved compilation errors launch succeds no matter what 
(except if the errors are in the class being launched). Prior builds terminated 
with an exception. A warning message is needed to indicate that something is 
wrong before program is actually launched giving an option to fo back and fix 
the problem. Same applies to debug.
We never supported this option. We support debugging with compile errors (i.e. 
suspend at compilation errors).


Deferred
Suspend won't help much if VM under debug doesn't supprot hot swapping. So, one 
can spend X number of minutes debugging just to get to the point where the 
problem would show up, get uresolved compilation error and suspended VM, try to 
fix it, then get "failed to hot replace", restart debug and spend another X 
minutes to get to the same point. In previous builds, launch would just fail 
with an exception which at least would indicate that something is wrong *up

	* Bug in Windows.  For some reason, when there is insufficient space
	* to show an item, LVM_ENSUREVISIBLE causes blank lines to be
	* inserted at the top of the widget.  A call to LVM_GETTOPINDEX will

    <WithStack>There are several times I am stepping over code and suddenly end up in a catch

Similarly, from a stack trace (in the debugger, or in the JUnit view) one 
would want to be able to 

1/ add a breakpoint for the exception that was thrown, or
2/ add a breakpoint for that exception constrained to the method/class it was 
thrown from, or
3/ add a breakpoint for that exception constrained to any method on the stack 
below where it was thrown from (or above, depending on your direction of

Did a pass.

I think we should clean this up some more.

(1) The extra call to log(IStatus) should be centralized to the #errorDialog 
method (so clients do not have to make two calls)
(2) We should always call #errorDialog or #log(IStatus)
(3) rename #logError to #logDebug (since that is a debug mode only dump, which 
is not generally what we want, and we call it from a lot of places where we 
should really call #log(IStatus).
(4) update calls that use #logError to use #log, unless it is intentionally 
debug only info. We can add a convenience method to create a status for 
exceptions.

Thoughts?
Will rework as proposal is much cleaner and consistent.
Removed "debug" exception logging.  Replaced with "debug" message logging 
(which is currently not used).

errorDialog methods always log the exception/status.  

Switched most of the error logging to pass an exception instead of a status.  
Logging a status is only useful if the status wrappers an exception...most 
don't.  Logging the exception provides the stack trace.
Please have a look.

    <WithStack>If the Header font is set to a large (24 point) font then the titles of the Run

STEPS
1) Select Preferences-&gt; Fonts
2) Set the Header font to 24 point
3) Select Run with - Runtime Workbench
4) Title will be cut off
This is not a specific PDE bug - it is a general JFace wizard problem. 

Moving to Platform UI.
This is not an issue in the other wizards in the workbench (such as the new 
wizards or the preference dialog).
Could it be because their title is shorter?
Are you using the Title Area Dialog? If so then it could be the characters you 
are using (Cs and Ss for instance) which are more likely to be cutoff. If you 
are using the TitleAreaDialog this should be moved the platform UI.
I am using the standard Wizard and WizardPage classes from JFace.
Dejan, this defect was still assigned to you which means that nobody on the UI 
team has looked at this. You also need to changethe ownerhip of the defect.

Please take a look at this defect and if you still think that the UI team needs 
to address this defect reassign this bug to the component owner. 
A problem with wizard header when using large fonts.
Please check that it works satisfactorily in the default large fonts setting.

I believe if you shutdown/restart the workbench between 2 and 3 it works.
Fixed - was caused by stale model objects due to lack of Core resource 
notification.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>With Mar 19 integration build, I've been noticing that the
Console scrolling is very jerky and slow when large amounts
of text are being printed to it.

It looks like it fills a buffer of stderr/stdout data, prints
it in one go, pauses, then repeats until no output remains.
It can take several seconds to display a few hundred lines of
output whereas before it would scroll by smoothly and quickly
in a second or so.
I'd say this bug has major severity. Debugging performance is way down for me 
in the latest stable release (20020321) as I deal with a lot of console log 
output in my usual work, and I can't think of a workaround for the problem.

In 2.1 Help web based UI has two implementations: advanced and basic.  
Konqueror is now presented with the basic one and it works O.K.

It would be nicer if advanced implementation worked on Konqueror, and was used

out elements of help ui correctly.  The tabs can be switched, the navigation 
can be expanded and tree browsed to display topics.  Dynamic loading of 
navigation (in 3.0 stream) works as well.

There are however some outstanding issues:  Search, bookmarks, back/forward do 
not work.  Search scope dialog does not open.  Synchronization does not expand

I have a modified file org.eclipse.ui.internal.model.WorkbenchWorkingSets from 
a stream called working_sets in dev.eclipse.org. 
I want to create a version tag for the file:
-enter the tag name
-press ok, progress dialog appears
-there's no CVS console output and no tag is created (i.e., nothing in the 
resource history)

Workspace available on request.
Works for me.

Knut, pls pack up your workspace so we can have a look.  If too large to attach 
or email let me know and we can FTP it.
The tag did occur but its hard to say if it was on the first try or not. The 
interesting part of this scenario is that it occured on a file that was created 
in the branch. In the repo, there is a revision 1.1 and 1.2.1.1 of the file. 
The questions that need to be answered are:
1. Is there a problem tagging files that were created on a branch
2. Why do we allow tagging on files if we don't let the user do anything with 
them?
3. Why were no messages printed in the console.

    <WithStack>This is because the history element is a wrapper for a config (not the config 
itself).
Now that I have fixed up launch config history elements, the config gets 
removed when renamed, as this is fired as "remove" and "add" events.
Suggest to change launch config listener interface to supply "movedFrom" when a 
config is added, and "movedTo" when a config is deleted (null if not moved). 
The impementation is tricky though.
Current behavior is sufficient - config is removed from history. Deferred
Resolving to later.
Re-open to mark as fixed
This has been fixed at some point in the 2.1 stream - the moved from/to 
attributes can be retrieved from the launch manager.
Please verify, Darin (S).
What is fixed here?
The config just disappears from the history. I thought the goal of this bug 
report was to actually rename the entry in the history?
Ah yes, I just read the "move to/from" support part and thought we were done. I 
will mark as later again...

    <WithStack>Just like all other Unix apps, Eclipse should default to storing its workspace
somewhere in the user's $HOME directory.  People who want their workspace
somewhere else should have to use the -data switch.

Bug 5927 together with the fact that Eclipse wants to save its workspace in the
current working directory makes the install directory the current default
position for the workspace.  As the install directory will in many cases be
write protected, the current default is broken on many systems.
*** Bug 20526 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 21249 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bug 23090 suggests the same thing on Win32 boxes.  It suggests the default
workspace directory should be in the directory specified by the user's profile.
 This is hopefully the same as what System.getProperty("user.home") will return.
*** Bug 23090 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Too many people depend on the current behaviour.
Users are able to specify the location of the workspace with the -data command 
line argument.
How about a compromise that will satisfy new and old users: If there's no
data argumnet, check the current directory for a workspace directory.  If
one exists, use it.  Otherwise, check the user's home directory.  If
a workspace directory exists there, use it. Otherwise, create one in
the user's home directory.

This way, nobody's existing eclipse installation will break, but new users
won't be subject to the really confusing behavior of pwd-dependent workspaces.

I'd *really* like to see this bug reopened.
*** Bug 26226 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I also think this should be reopened. My comments from Bug 26226:

By default, Eclipse puts the workspace in the current working directory. In
general, users launch Eclipse from the install directory. This model is
dangerous in single-user installs because it means that deleting the Eclipse
install will also delete the workspace. This model is wrong in shared
installs because the user cannot write to the Eclipse install dir.

This model is confusing to the user in general because most applications
don't care about where you launch them from. Users have no expectation that there will be a difference if they launch a program from /home/$USER/foo one
day and from /home/$USER/bar the next.

We should put the workspace in a platform-standard location. On Linux, the
normal place to put the user's workspace would be in the user's home
directory, probably in a folder named ".eclipse". I'm not sure what the norm
is for Windows, but I'd speculate that a better place to put the user's
workspace would be their home dir.
For the sake of argument, why would people launch from the install directory on
a multi-user install?  I would never cd to /usr/bin to launch any other
application on unix.  Other apps, such as editors and the java command line
tools, work the same as eclipse.  You cd to where your data is, then you invoke
the tool. If I invoke "emacs foo.txt" or "java A.java", it will look in the pwd
for the data.  If I type "make" or "ant", it looks in the pwd for the build file.

I think the confusion is over the fact that eclipse stores metadata and user
data in the same diectory (the "-data" directory).  Typically a unix program
will take user data from the pwd, and put metadata (such as user settings,
preferences) in the user's home directory.  In eclipse they're stored together,
so it's a toss-up as to which policy makes the most sense. Michael's suggestion
about search in the home directory if a workspace isn't found in the pwd is
worth considering.
Inspired by John Arthones comment, I opened bug 26756 about storing Eclipse's
metadata in ~/.eclipse.
The point about Eclipse failing if you launch it from the install directory
was just an example of the more general problem which is the fact that
Eclipse has an unexpected tie to the current working dir. I can think of no
other Linux app that writes files to the current working directory when launched.

I don't think the comparison to Emacs is fair because Emacs is a single file
editor that you pass a filename to. The fact that the filename is resolved to
the current directory is just standard shell behavior. I think Mail is much
closer to Eclipse. Like Eclipse, mail programs contain transient user data
and metadata that the user is presented with each time they launch. Like
Eclipse, the location of the users mail in the filesystem is implicit by
default; You don't specify a file to open when you launch Eclipse or a mail
program. Unlike Eclipse, mail programs follow the *nux convention of storing
their data in the user's home directory.

For clarify, there are two distinct issues here:
1. The current behavior causes problems (user confusion, loss of data, 
failure to launch)
2. The current behavior is not standard behavior on Linux. Standard behavior
for a Linux app is to store program data in the users home dir.
*** Bug 27902 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I concur with the users below. The current model only works on single-user systems (like Windows) where everyone typically has their own install of the tool.

On multi-user systems, the default should be to use the home directory.

Even on Windows systems, it can be really confusing for the users. One user created a shortcut to Eclipse to discover that the workspace wasn't in the ${Eclipse}/workspace, but in the same directory as the shortcut.

Lastly, on other systems (like Mac OS X) you don't run eclipse as a command line; you run it as an application by double clicking on it in the user interface.

Note also that unlike emacs, Eclipse isn't about editing a single file. It's about editing a set of files in a per-project repository, which may not even be the usual location of the workspace anyway. The only difference is where the per-user workspace is stored, which then can point to projects outside of the Eclipse workspace area.

This bug really should be reopened. DJ Horton's comments that too many people depending on the current behaviour could easily be addressed by a migration tool, or by checking to see if the per-install workspace existed first, and if not defaulting to a per-user install instead.

Since Johan already opened another bug for this, I'd like to keep this one
closed.  Feel free to CC yourself (or vote on) bug 26756 instead.  I realize the
wording of the bugs is slightly different, but if we revisit this issue you can
be sure there will be a carefully considered proposal and a round of feedback
before anything is implemented.  Having two open bug reports doesn't make it
more likely that we'll change it ;)

Thanks.  Resolved "duplicate" is much nicer than resolved "wontfix".  I had no
idea that this was tracked in another bug before.
John, would you mind reversing the Duplicate status of these two bugs? This
bug is older than Bug 26756, it has a bunch of CCs, and it has a lot more
feedback.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Just like all other Unix apps, Eclipse should default to storing its workspace
somewhere in the user's $HOME directory.  People who want their workspace
somewhere else should have to use the -data switch.

Bug 5927 together with the fact that Eclipse wants to save its workspace in the
current working directory makes the install directory the current default
position for the workspace.  As the install directory will in many cases be
write protected, the current default is broken on many systems.
*** Bug 20526 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 21249 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bug 23090 suggests the same thing on Win32 boxes.  It suggests the default
workspace directory should be in the directory specified by the user's profile.
 This is hopefully the same as what System.getProperty("user.home") will return.
*** Bug 23090 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Too many people depend on the current behaviour.
Users are able to specify the location of the workspace with the -data command 
line argument.
How about a compromise that will satisfy new and old users: If there's no
data argumnet, check the current directory for a workspace directory.  If
one exists, use it.  Otherwise, check the user's home directory.  If
a workspace directory exists there, use it. Otherwise, create one in
the user's home directory.

This way, nobody's existing eclipse installation will break, but new users
won't be subject to the really confusing behavior of pwd-dependent workspaces.

I'd *really* like to see this bug reopened.
*** Bug 26226 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I also think this should be reopened. My comments from Bug 26226:

By default, Eclipse puts the workspace in the current working directory. In
general, users launch Eclipse from the install directory. This model is
dangerous in single-user installs because it means that deleting the Eclipse
install will also delete the workspace. This model is wrong in shared
installs because the user cannot write to the Eclipse install dir.

This model is confusing to the user in general because most applications
don't care about where you launch them from. Users have no expectation that there will be a difference if they launch a program from /home/$USER/foo one
day and from /home/$USER/bar the next.

We should put the workspace in a platform-standard location. On Linux, the
normal place to put the user's workspace would be in the user's home
directory, probably in a folder named ".eclipse". I'm not sure what the norm
is for Windows, but I'd speculate that a better place to put the user's
workspace would be their home dir.
For the sake of argument, why would people launch from the install directory on
a multi-user install?  I would never cd to /usr/bin to launch any other
application on unix.  Other apps, such as editors and the java command line
tools, work the same as eclipse.  You cd to where your data is, then you invoke
the tool. If I invoke "emacs foo.txt" or "java A.java", it will look in the pwd
for the data.  If I type "make" or "ant", it looks in the pwd for the build file.

I think the confusion is over the fact that eclipse stores metadata and user
data in the same diectory (the "-data" directory).  Typically a unix program
will take user data from the pwd, and put metadata (such as user settings,
preferences) in the user's home directory.  In eclipse they're stored together,
so it's a toss-up as to which policy makes the most sense. Michael's suggestion
about search in the home directory if a workspace isn't found in the pwd is
worth considering.
Inspired by John Arthones comment, I opened bug 26756 about storing Eclipse's
metadata in ~/.eclipse.
The point about Eclipse failing if you launch it from the install directory
was just an example of the more general problem which is the fact that
Eclipse has an unexpected tie to the current working dir. I can think of no
other Linux app that writes files to the current working directory when launched.

I don't think the comparison to Emacs is fair because Emacs is a single file
editor that you pass a filename to. The fact that the filename is resolved to
the current directory is just standard shell behavior. I think Mail is much
closer to Eclipse. Like Eclipse, mail programs contain transient user data
and metadata that the user is presented with each time they launch. Like
Eclipse, the location of the users mail in the filesystem is implicit by
default; You don't specify a file to open when you launch Eclipse or a mail
program. Unlike Eclipse, mail programs follow the *nux convention of storing
their data in the user's home directory.

For clarify, there are two distinct issues here:
1. The current behavior causes problems (user confusion, loss of data, 
failure to launch)
2. The current behavior is not standard behavior on Linux. Standard behavior
for a Linux app is to store program data in the users home dir.
*** Bug 27902 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I concur with the users below. The current model only works on single-user systems (like Windows) where everyone typically has their own install of the tool.

On multi-user systems, the default should be to use the home directory.

Even on Windows systems, it can be really confusing for the users. One user created a shortcut to Eclipse to discover that the workspace wasn't in the ${Eclipse}/workspace, but in the same directory as the shortcut.

Lastly, on other systems (like Mac OS X) you don't run eclipse as a command line; you run it as an application by double clicking on it in the user interface.

Note also that unlike emacs, Eclipse isn't about editing a single file. It's about editing a set of files in a per-project repository, which may not even be the usual location of the workspace anyway. The only difference is where the per-user workspace is stored, which then can point to projects outside of the Eclipse workspace area.

This bug really should be reopened. DJ Horton's comments that too many people depending on the current behaviour could easily be addressed by a migration tool, or by checking to see if the per-install workspace existed first, and if not defaulting to a per-user install instead.

I was in the Java perspective.
I had 'split' my editor area by dragging an editor out of the tab group and 
inserting it underneath the tab group.  When I tried to close the editor in the 
lower half of the tab group the attached exception occurred.

At this point I was forced to shutdown Eclipse to try to restore UI 
functionality.

When I restarted Eclipse, no editors were open, but the editor area still had a 
visible split in it.  I opened an editor and it filled the top half of the 
area.  I then tried to drag the editor into the lower half, at which point it 
expanded to fill the whole area.

Now I'm unable to repeat the problem.

In a number of places we get the location of the caret by calling getXAtOffset
(caretOffset). 
I haven't looked at the code but we may be able to replace this with a call to 
caret.getLocation().x. This won't be possible though if the caret is null 
(i.e., when there is no caret). We could at least optimize the case when there 
is a caret.

The plugins in the platform that require xerces should explicitly specify which 
version of xerces they require.  Otherwise, if some third party ships a newer 
version of xerces with their plugins, the platform plugins will try to use that 
newer version.

Example:

Core plugins require xerces 1.4.2
Plugin com.xyz requires xerces 2.0.1, so they include that version with their 
plugins

Now core plugins are using xerces 2.0.1, which may not be compatible with 1.4.2.
From Bob Foster:

Thank again for continuing to follow up. I did check the bug report. The
problem is apparently deeper than that.

I changed all standard plugin.xmls that referred to xerces to use
version="3.2.1" match="exact", and I changed my own to use version="2.0.1"
match="exact". In this version, Eclipse runs normally but my plugin fails
to load and there is no log message at all!

Just for kicks, I replaced all "3.2.1" with "1.4.2". This produces the log
message:

        1=============&lt;children&gt;=============
        2 org.eclipse.core.runtime 1 Unable to satisfy prerequisite constraint
from com.objfac.xmleditor to org.apache.xerces.
        1=============&lt;/children&gt;=============

Not very illuminating. Don't tell whether Eclipse tried to satisfy the
constraint and failed or just threw up its hands. Suspect the latter.
This is now invalid because platform core plugins no longer require xerces</WithStack>

When the error occurs, hit ok.  The error dialog pops up again.  No matter what 
you do, it keeps popping up the dialog.  You have to kill eclipse to get out of 
it.  The guilty code is in:

If performFinish fails, stepIndex does not get incremented, and the while loop 
continues forever.
Although this code is no longer used, this bug should be addressed since it's 
likely we will revisit capabilities post 2.0.


Defer until after release 2.0  Also, when the capability stuff is exposed

On line 230 of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.batch.Main.compile(String[])
the out stream is flushed.  But if a log file was specified, it needs to be closed.

I have tested replacing:

} finally {
   out.flush();
}

with:

} finally {
   if (log != null) {
      out.close();
   } else {
      out.flush();
   }
}

An it appears to fix my test case.  I tried to boil my test case down, but I
couldn't get a reproducable one.  You may not want to waste your time on this
test case.

A close approximation of my test case is the following:

1. New PDE project, test.
2. Create a new Java file.
3. Put an error in the java file.
4. Right-click on the plugin.xml and select "Create Plug-in JARs".
5. When the ant dialog comes up select test.jar and testsrc.zip, click Finish.
6. Refresh local on the test project.
7. Delete the test.jar.bin.log file, sometimes you get errors.
I think ideally the right code is:
   out.flush();
   if (log != null) {
      out.close();
   }

Fixed and released in HEAD.
