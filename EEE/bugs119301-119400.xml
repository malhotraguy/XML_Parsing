    <WithStack>Activity period should be flexible and not impose workflow while making daily and weekly planning easy.
- since date
- since last plan
- yesterday
- last week

Also, the reporting of estimates and "yesterday's weather" needs to be improved.
It will also be helpful to state the precise period used. 
Done, except for sine "last plan" which will involve incorporating plans into task list.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If you try to set the widthHint, for example of a (Grid's) LayoutData of an element, VE will produce code like:

button.getLayoutData().widthHint = 100;  

This is a problem, as getLayoutData is not casted properly... but this is also the result that we do not promote anymore the LayoutData.
Similar problem with setting the fields on an AWT FlowLayout produces code like:
   this.getLayout().setAlignment(FlowLayout.LEFT);
FlowLayout should be promoted to a local field so it can be set properly.
The fix has been  released to HEAD.

//Create an instance of the SWT renderer
IRenderer renderer = new SWTGraphicViewer(parent, SWT.DIALOG_TRIM );
		 
//Render chart
Generator.instance().run(renderer, chart);

The run method performs unnecessary chart model tranformations that distorts the swt rendering.

The work around is to replace the run method with the following:


((SWTGraphicViewer)renderer).setContent((IDItem)chart);


The set content will not transform the model.
Removed the model transformation code.

    <WithStack>This bug occurs when the Mylar monitor is used as a plug-in, not when it is run in a runtime workbench.

Due to renaming of packages for plug-in creation (i.e. adding the version number), the path to the .html file is changed.  When the consent form displays the ethics information (.html file), file cannot be found.

I have a fix for this bug, please assign it to zazam@uvic.ca.
This should actually be fixed in 0.4.4 (Leah was having trouble with it too, and was the one who implemented the fix).  Could you verify that it works Suzanne, and if there's any additional patching that needs to be done I'll be happy to apply it.
Created attachment 31149
Suzanne's patch (small fix)

Leah, I took a look at the latest code from head, and I figure your fix is probably the same as mine.  If it isn't the same, could you tell me what your fix was and I'll test it as well (if you'd like).

Leah's patch

Suzanne, this is my version of the fix, which hasn't been applied yet. I just synched up and tried applying your patch but the consent form didn't show up for me in the runtime workspace nor when I deployed the plug-in. Did you change the path of the consentForm extension point for your study's plugin.xml?
I have my consent form location defined in my plugin.xml as:
consentForm="doc/gild-study-ethics.html"

Leah, your bug fix appears to be pretty much the same as mine.  (Thankfully!) You altered some of the exception handling code and you have moved the following line slightly:

customizingPlugin = extensions[i].getNamespace();

(Did you find this impacted the display of the consent form, or was it for another reason?)

Really, the change in the setFormsConsent() method parameter seems to be the major change.  I applied that part of your patch (you had a "/" prepended, that was the only difference) and your patch worked both for my runtime and plug-in.  

Since Leah's patch is basically the same as mine (I don't know why mine didn't work for Leah, maybe the "/" needed to be prepended, but not for mine?)  I would  have Leah's patch for the next version of Mylar submitted.
Leah: should I apply this patch then?  The next release is on Friday so it would be good to have this in there for both of you.

Leah's patch

Yes, if Suzanne hasn't had any trouble with the patch then we can apply it.

Suzanne - The line you were talking about:
   customizingPlugin = extensions[i].getNamespace();
didn't need to be moved so I've left it where it was originally for this patch.
Patch committed.  Suzanne, please verify so that we can close this.
I have tested the patch on both a Gild study runtime and a plug-in environment.  The patch works fine.  Please close bug.
Excellent.  It's great that both of you are relying on the same functionality and can benefit from each other's efforts.  For future issues of this let's try to keep each other in the loop by adding to the CC list.</WithStack>

I'm assuming this is off by one and was intended to be logged as a "Debug" bug.  Please move back and explain if this is indeed a doc bug.
The model proxy should do the auto-expand when it is installed. It almost works (except the launch does not auto expand yet).
Fixed in LaunchView and LanuchManagerProxy. Removed auto-expand code from launch view and added code to expand existing launches when the lanuch manager proxy is installed in the debug view.
Please verify, Kevin.

    <WithStack>A new entry section called "Charting Service" should be added to the release 
notes.  

The following should be added:

SWT charts are distorted when using the  org.eclipse.tptp.platform.report.core.provisional.Generator.run method.

To generate a SWT chart a developer would typically run the following code:
 //Create an instance of the SWT renderer
 IRenderer renderer = new SWTGraphicViewer(parent, SWT.DIALOG_TRIM );

 //show the chart in the SWT renderer
 Generator.instance().run(renderer, chart);

This will render distorted SWT charts.  The run method does unessessary chart model modifications. Instead developer should execute the following code:

 //Create an instance of the SWT renderer
 IRenderer renderer = new SWTGraphicViewer(parent, SWT.DIALOG_TRIM );

 //show the chart in the SWT renderer
 ((SWTGraphicViewer)renderer).setContent((IDItem)chart);
Completed in the 4.2 time frame.

Sorry due to the limitation of cvs i cannot download the plain-text attachment for cvs forcing me to view it on browser. I've tried to copy the content of the text and then save it to the txt file with UTF-8 without BOM format, and everything seems ok for me.

And I am not sure what's your meaning in "Project settings use UTF-8 for text file encoding", do you mean you have selected "UTF-8" as encoding method when you are creating the flatfile datasource?

Could you please try to reproduce this bug again in your local machine with regarding to :
1.Select "UTF-8" as encoding format in data source creation dialog.
2.In same dialog, check the box "Use second line as data type indicator".

If the bug still exists, could you please zip the problematic txt file and attach it to cvs, or just forward it to me using email address lzhu@actuate.com.

Thanks.
The bug is caused by not correctly recognizing the txt file with extension in uppercase. Fixed in source.

I'm trying to edit a schema file using the extension point schema editor. When I open the editor, it brings me to the source page directly. If I try to switch to the Definition or Documentation tab, it says:

"The source page has errors. Other pages cannot be used until these errors are corrected."

However, if I go back to the source page, there are no errors shown. I believe there is something wrong with the schema file itself that is causing this, because this schema is only used for generating documentation. I will attach the schema file...

schema
Hi Curtis,

The XML Schema schema attached is a valid XML Schema document that violates
a number of Eclipse XML Schema limitations within the Extension Point Schema
Editor.

Two primary problems preventing you from viewing the form page:

(1) Use of XML Namespaces

      e.g. "xsd"

(2) Missing application info not present in the root schema annotation:

      e.g.:

      &lt;appInfo&gt;
         &lt;meta.schema plugin="org.example.test" id="ID" name="NAME"/&gt;
      &lt;/appInfo&gt;

I'm attaching a modified version of your XML Schema that corrects these 
problems.  Now you will at least be able to get to the form page.

Additional inconsistencies which may befuddle the editor include:

(3) Use of XML Schema extension facets

      e.g.:

    &lt;element name="description"&gt;
        &lt;complexType&gt;
            &lt;simpleContent&gt;
                &lt;extension base="string"/&gt;
            &lt;/simpleContent&gt;

    <WithStack>Previously, when creating a new EJB project, there was an option to create a default session bean.  In current WTP drivers, I don't see this option anymore.

Is there a way to create a default session bean programmatically during the EJB project creation?

&gt; Previously, when creating a new EJB project, there was an option to create a
&gt; default session bean.  In current WTP drivers, I don't see this option anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a way to create a default session bean programmatically during the EJB
&gt; project creation?
&gt; 
Is this still relevant?
In an EJB 3.0 project the ejb-jar.xml is optional. There might be 0 or * beans in the project.

Or you would like to see the option only for EJB 2.1&lt; projects?

It is still relevant - even for EJB 3.x modules without ejb-jar.xml. In this case the EJB JAR archive is just an ordinary JAR archive. The only thing that makes it EJB JAR is the annotated bean classes in it. If there is not such class then it is not an EJB JAR. 

In WTP if you have an EJB 3.0 project without ejb-jar.xml and no bean, then it cannot be exported as valid EJB JAR. Many server runtimes like Glassfish and JBoss fails deploying such JARs, complaining that there is no EJB bean there. 

So, in EJB 3.0 you still need 1 or * beans in the project. 
We will try to implement this enhancements for EJB 3.0 projects in two steps:
  - implement validation that shows error marker when an EJB 3.0 project has no enterprise bean. 
  - implement two quick fixes for the error marker: "Create Session Bean" and "Create Message-Driven Bean". Each of the quick fixes will call the corresponding wizard.

No beans validation error for EJB 3.x projects

    I've created a validator (v2) for this problem which shows error on the EJB 3.x project with two quick fixes available allowing the user to open wizards for new session or message-driven bean. 

    It works fine except for the only problem that the validator could be triggered only manually. Perhaps I've implemented something wrong since the validator doesn't trigger when I add/delete a bean from the project. 

    I've debugged it and appears that when I add/delete a bean from the project the method AbstractValidator.validationStarting(...) is being invoked by the framework, but later the UIEJB3Validator.validate(...) method(s) are not invoked.

    Any ideas?

No beans validation error for EJB 3.x projects v2

    This version of the patch works fine. But there is a little hack in it. I'm using the fact that the validationStarting(...) method of my validator is being invoked when it's supposed to and in its body I'm invoking the actual validation. 

    If somebody has an idea how to implement it better, please share it.

patch v3

Thanks for the patch. Everything is functionally correct. 
I just made some structural and cosmetics changes to the contribution. The most significant is that I moved the UI related code to the jee.ui plugin. This way we avoid the UI dependencies in the jee.ejb plugin.
Patch v3 committed to HEAD.
This caused a dependency cycle between jst.jee.ui (where you added a prereq to jst.ejb.ui) and jst.ejb.ui, which already prereqs jst.jee.ui.
I moved everything you added to org.eclipse.jst.jee.ui over to org.eclipse.jst.ejb.ui - that is the quickest way to fix things up short term.

I also noticed that none of the new .java files nor the new .properties file has the EPL header in it.  (Except for the Messages.java, which has an old IBM EPL header - that should be fixed up, too.)

Please review my changes and fix up as appropriate.
Thanks, Carl!
I added the missing copyright headers.
One last change- in UIEJB3Validator, it checks to see if the total number of session and message driven beans are 0.  There are circumstances where ejbJar.getEnterpriseBeans() returns null, and this should display the validation error.  And there are times where an EJB project could have an Entity bean in it - this should not display the validation error.

I am committing a change to HEAD for UIEJB3Validator to fix those scenarios.
One last, last change - the org.eclipse.jst.ejb.ui.internal.quickfixes.ejb was not listed in the Export-Package section of the MANIFEST.MF for org.eclipse.jst.ejb.ui.  I am adding it in as an internal package.</WithStack>

There seems to be a performance degradation since the new report archive implementation is used. The bug is reopened for further investigation. 
Improved the performance of report archive by providing write(byte b[]) and write(byte b[], int off, int len) to RAFileOutputStream.

A property to override the manifest's Bundle-RequiredExectionEnvironment.  This implies a values for the bootclasspath, javacSource and javacTarget if they are not already set.

Top level build.properties:  change bootclasspath.&lt;EE&gt; to simply &lt;EE&gt;
ie: bootclasspath.J2SE-1.4 -&gt; J2SE-1.4


PDE.UI will need to pass the top level &lt;EE&gt; properties supported.  The value for the &lt;EE&gt; property is expected to be the path to the jars for the bootclasspath ("C:\jre\lib\rt.jar;C:\jre\lib\jsse.jar").  The value of jre.compilation.profile is expected to be one of those properties.

    <WithStack>I have dne some refactoring of the Team logical model support classes. Basically, I have moved several class from Team UI to Team Core. I have left stubs in Team UI so that LTK and JDT UI compile but they will not work until they are refactored to use the Core classes. I have also added an abstract class, ResourceMappingMerger,  for IResourceMappingMerger. The LTK/JDT merger should subclass this.

    <WithStack>I using a virtual table viewer with a ILazyContentProvider.
VirtualTableViewer.setItemCount(Integer.MAX_VALUE) just crashs my jvm. Looks like this is not just a value that is used to cacluate the length of the scrollbar, but shouldn't it do it more than that, since it is a virtual table?

Hi, 
my investigation shows that it is somehow releated to a outofmemory exception.
A VIRTUAL table just means that you don't need to provide the data for all of the rows up-front.  How many rows get queried is completely up to the platform, and the operating systems often still need to create the data structures internally for the full table.

So, the item count does not only control the scroll bar.

Hmm, I see. Can you suggest any kind of workaround, may I need to implement a own table viewer or can I somehow manipulate the scroll bar? I want to implement a tool to browse a file type of apache project (nutch) that has may many million records, please give me at least a hint where to search for a workaround.
Thanks!
The end user can not scroll through millions of records and make any sense of them - perhaps you should have a filter mechanism that lets them narrow the results.

  /**

The latter is a better default.  If it cannot be te default then I should be able to produce a formatter profile to do this.
What component generates such a default comment ?
Ownership has changed for the formatter, but I surely will not have enough time to fix your bug during the 3.5 development process, hence set its priority to P5.
Please provide a patch if you definitely need the bug to be fixed in this version and I'll have a look at it...

    <WithStack>I have an iteration tag that is inside JavaScript tag like this:

&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
  var lookupObjects = new Array(&lt;%= values.size() %&gt;);
&lt;% int i = 0; %&gt;
&lt;chr:scriptIteration name="lookupObject" type="crha.util.database.Lookup" iterator="&lt;%= values.iterator() %&gt;"&gt;
  lookupObjects[&lt;%= i++ %&gt;] = new Array("&lt;%= Library.escapeQuotes(lookupObject.getDescription()) %&gt;", "&lt;%= lookupObject.getID().toString() %&gt;");
&lt;/chr:scriptIteration&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

The validator doesn't seem to parse any JSP tags inside JavaScript tags.  Even the syntax colorer seems to be wrong as it displays it as javascript code.  However it does pick up "i = 0" and i++ statements properly but not the iteration tag.  It gives me "lookupObject cannot be resolved" error in Problems window.

I am using Eclipse 3.1.1 with Web Standards Tools Feature 1.0.0
My suspect is that with the new JavaScript support this problem is handled even worse: try to create a JSP with something like this:

&lt;%@ taglib prefix="c"	uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  &lt;c:if test="true"&gt;
    function myFunction()
    {
      return true;
    }
  &lt;/c:if&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

The editor becomes messy and quite unusable... :-(
Hi, any update regarding this bug?
I'm having the same problem on Eclipse JEE 3.5 Galileo...
Everything is fine if i use "&lt;% ... %&gt;" within a javascript block in a jsp page, while jstl tags (or any custom tag, i suppose) are not recognized.
Tried to disable Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Validation-&gt;JavaScript syntax valid., but nothing changed.

This is a dup of Bug 156851 or the other way around.

I believe we've fixed the issues with custom tags not being parsed within script blocks. However, the validation messages that are being seen are likely caused by the JavaScript validator. Chris, do you have any advice?

But the issue of custom tags not being styled properly is still around.
Which validation messages are you referring to Nick?
(In reply to comment #7)
&gt; Which validation messages are you referring to Nick?

For the block of code from comment 5 I see several warnings/errors:

- Missing semicolon
- Syntax error on tokens, ( expected  instead
- Syntax error, insert ")" to complete PrimaryNoNewArrayStmt
- Syntax error on token(s), misplaced construct(s)
As mentioned in comment 8, I think the validation messages are coming from JSDT at this point. Variables should be able to be resolved in iteration tags within javascript blocks now.
Looks like the translator is having all sorts of problems with that script region.

This bug is still severely affecting user experience of the JSP editor in WTP 3.2.0. I hope that it will actually be targeted for 3.2.2!
Please note that I have a JSP now that is showing this problem. The strange thing is that:
- there are red marks on the overview ruler
- in the corresponding lines, the tags that are causing validation errors are underlined in red
BUT
- the vertical ruler does not show any errors (just other warnings)
- the JSP icon in the Project Explorer and in the editor selection tab do not have any red mark
- if I do right-click | Validate in the editor, the Validation Results information message says that the validation completed with 21 warnings (but no errors)

Is this discrepancy normal?
Yes, the JSP editor only paints Markers in the overview ruler, not as-you-type annotations.

It's sad to see that all the bugs I found on JSDT not only do they don't get fixed, although they severely affect the usability of the Eclipse Javascript tools and support, but after some years they are even lowered in Severity...
Bugs should be set at the proper severity even if they have been open for some time and resources have yet to be available to work on them.

If you would like to submit a patch, we will gladly review it. We have several community submitted patches currently being reviewed and triaged for the next maintenance release (3.5.1). We plan to start delivering them this week. Then we will be prioritizing other open defects to investigate.

    <WithStack>Whenever I do a C/C++ type launch and the required project for the launch currently contains an error, it prompts me if I want to continue.  However, it doesn't seem to matter whether I choose "Yes" or "No", it won't launch.  

I think I tracked this down to org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.CompileErrorPromptStatusHandler.  Basically after showing the dialog it checks for "OK_ID", but it is a Yes/No dialog so OK_ID is never returned.  It seems CDT is the only one using this class.  Other launch configs use CompileErrorProjectPromptStatusHandler, which is a very similar class, but handles the return value correctly.  I'm using CDT 3.0.1, Eclipse 3.1.

    <WithStack>When highlighting a dataset or toggling on/off a dataset on a SWT chart the entire canvas is redrawn causing flickering problems.  This does not occur in the SWING renderer. 

This problem becomes quite annoying when highlighting a dataset.  The flickering can confuse the user which data was actually highlighted.
This is because our test code just render the chart directly into the canvas GC, if you use a double-buffered drawing policy, the performance then can be greatly improved.
This is indeed a double buffering issue.

This example uses a double buffering technique to avoid flickering in SWT interactive charts
The examples provided with the chart examples plugin now shows how to do the 
double buffering for SWT. So I change this as an enhancement to include a 
"double buffering" setting in the SWT device renderer, to make it easier for 
users who wish to benefit from it automatically. This enhancement can be 
deferred.
The SWT examples don't use double buffering in the new code, please update them 
to use double buffering.

This appears to be due to the fact that the property that is read in is a String, yet the meta resources wants an IPath.
The properties of a component are String based, so you must make sure these are set properly.......   Let us know if we are mishandling the strings....
IVirtualComponent.setMetaResources(IPath[]theMetaResourcePaths) is the method that we are using to set the meta resources.  That is the proper method to set the meta resources.  (Note: this is not the metaProperties, it is the metaResources.)

Now, in the .component file, it is stored as:
&lt;meta-resources&gt;foo&lt;/meta-resources&gt;

When the .component file is read back in on workbench restart, it goes to set the meta resources with the string foo, which causes an ArrayStoreException.

An easy test for this- make a web project, shut down the workbench, add the above line in the .component file, and restart the workbench.
This is fixed for RC2.

Adding to Hot List at the request of Scott Peddle and setting priority to P2 in case it is reopened. Scott, pls verify the fix asap. Thx.
Verified that this is fixed in WTP 1.0 RC4.

    <WithStack>We are having a problem where we do not get notified of a new AST after an AST re-write. Digging into the SelectionListenerWithASTManager, I see it is because the CompilationUnit (astRoot) that is fetched via ASTProvider.getAST() is null. This would be ok, except there is no subsequent notification with a legitimate CompilationUnit until some other event (such as clicking on the CompilationUnit editor) triggers it. Repro is as follows:

1.) Create a new Java Project
2.) Create a new Java class. Important: leave it open.
3.) Create another new Java class
4.) Click Source-&gt;Add comment

No notification ever arrives because the astRoot is null. You can see this by putting a println or a breakpoint after SelectionListenerWithASTManager.java:167.
Moving to JDT UI
I could not reproduce this with your steps: step 4 causes a selection change and hence sends out the correct AST. However, I can reproduce it if I only do step 1 to 3 or even if I simply open a CU.
Fixed in HEAD.

Verified that the scenario in comment 0 and the steps in comment 2 work as expected. Found what I think is a similar case under some conditions, see bug 120572.
I still still this. With the exact same repro as below.
We've verified this using the M4, see comment 5. In which build do you see this? If it's newer than M4 then please reopen a new bug.
I saw it on 3.1.2. This was only fixed in 3.2, then?

*** Bug 108914 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Could you tell me if the fix for this bug is simply checking fAST for null in ASTProvider.getAST(), or if the fix required is more complex?
No, the fix affects several classes and is more complicated since we also found and fixed another scenario (see bug 120572) when verifing the initial fixing for this one. I did a quick check and think the following classes cover the fixes:
- ASTProvider rev. 1.45
- JavaEditor rev. 1.379
- SelectionListenerWithASTManager rev. 1.27

No guarantee though ;-)</WithStack>

    <WithStack>We are a client of org.eclipse.compare. We are developing our Compare/Merge component on top of org.eclipse.compare that allows comparing/merging of modeling artifacts. Currently, we are trying to componentize our component. We want to break up our component into two parts: com.ibm.xtools.comparemerge.core and com.ibm.xtools.comparemerge.ui.  After the componentization, our core component should not be dependent on eclipse ui.  Users can use our core component to silently merge their modeling artifacts without invoking any eclipse ui.  

org.eclipse.compare is now causing problem to our componentization process. Since our core component has to depend on org.eclipse.compare (in order to use things like IStreamMerger), and org.eclipse.compare is currently depending on org.eclipse.ui; there is currently no way for our core component to not  depend on eclipse ui. 

I believe that the problem can only be fixed if org.eclipse.compare is going to be broken up into two parts: org.eclipse.compare.core and org.eclipse.compare.ui, such that org.eclipse.compare.core does not have any dependency on Eclipse ui.

BTW, most of eclipse components are in two parts right now: core and ui...This is the correct way of doing things. This supports rich client platform. 

Please look at the problem and fix it as soon as possible. It is currently blocking our componentization process. Thank you very much.
Mocing to team since we are planning on creating a repalcement API that is based on IStorage. Team has a Core/UI split already so I've adjusted the title.
I have added an IStorageMerger to the Team/Core plugin and modified the merge context to use this API.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The Tree Model/Viewer Descriptons are using Class as an argument to the addColumn, addChildrenProperties.

This will not work for dynamic EMF objects, as EMF uses EClass object to represent the meta information for the class.  We need to change this to Object.
Do you think we should move from Class to Object in other places too (e.g. converter)?
I would think so.  Ugh.

Thanks for pointing this out Gili.
Marking as M5 since this affects the API.
Setting target milestone to 3.2 since we the API for trees is still in flux.
Closing stale bugs.</WithStack>

David,

Any chance that this issue will be resolved for 2.0? Your last comment from more than a year ago indicated that this will be looked at for the 1.5 release...

There has been interest in this issue from BEA's product group adopting WTP 2.0.
M6 is in shut down, please triage if appropriate for a 2.0 RC milestone.
Fixed in RC0.  Note that for the moment the tag directive may be flagged as unknown, but we expect to have that cleared up well before RC0 is declared.

In reply to comment #3, Edward.Min, could you retry that scenario with an RC0 build?
Verified with 3.0RC4-20080610084135</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Using WTP 1.0 RC1, when I import an EAR file, the workbench hangs.  Looking at the thread dump, execution in one thread has passed through FacetedProject.modifyInternal(), which is synchronized, and is waiting to aquire an Eclipse Jobs semaphore, while another thread is in StaticWebDeployableFactory.isValidModule(), waiting on a call to FacetedProject.hasProjectFacet(), which is synchronized.

Could you attach the ear file that causes the hang?
Created attachment 31198
Ear file for the problem

I have attached the EAR file for this bug.
Haven't been able to reproduce it so far using the provided ear file. Tried half a dozen times with the debugger and half a dozen times without a debugger. 

Note that the ear import wizard does not report progress, so it goes away for a quite a while with ui non-responsive. 
Its definitly hung.

From the thread dump, one of the threads involved is handling resource change notifications, so there is likely a timing issue involved.
This looks very similar to bug 119066.
John, I was not able to reproduce either .. well, ok, I wasn't trying with RC1, exactly. Will try that this afternoon. But, wanted to clarify, since you marked as blocker does that mean you * always * see it? 

Also, do you know if other stuff is "going on" in your workbench when you try this? Such as is another build in progress? 


On my Linux machine, I see this 100% of the time when I import an EAR file.

There is nothing else going on; I start with a clean workspace, and import an EAR file, and it hangs.
I just released the changes to implement a revised locking strategy that should avoid this deadlock.
This change is a bulk update of all _un_targeted, fixed, resolved bugs upon release of M5. This particular bug _might_ have been fixed earlier than M5. (Feel free to correct).

Here's a potential algorithm:
1. Using the builds.xml official latest releases RSS feed, we can generate a mapping of features -&gt; projects (the project is the one that publishes the RSS feed; the features are the feature ids in that release).
2. Using the feature files, we can build a mapping of features -&gt; prereq features.
3. Using (2) we can create the mapping of features -&gt; closure of prereq features.
4. Using (1) we can map (3) to be project -&gt; closure of prereq projects.
5. Using (5) we can merge all the IP logs (found via project-info.xmls) to form project -&gt; merged IP log.

    <WithStack>Description: Report design can't be modified.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a report.
2. Preview and then edit it.
3. Preview again.
4. It is not modified.
I am not able to re-produce it. Please verify. Also make sire those libs are copied to the right place.
Assigned to Build.
What does those libs point to? If means 3rd party libs and js, they are all in correct folder.
I experience the same issue, the original description is slightly innacurate, the report design can be modified, but the preview keeps using the original design.

Steps:
- create a new report
- add a dataset/datasource/chart and preview it: you see the chart
- go back to design mode and delete the chart
- drop the dataset directly as a table on the report design.
- preview the report: you still see the chart and no table.

Note that the time shown in preview is changing, so the report is generated each time.  Closing and reopening the report design doesn't help, the preview is still stuck on the original design which must have been cached somewhere.

I did install the jar/js as specified.
This probably is caused by some changes in the designer to handle the design update status. When update the report design and switch the current focus, seems report design is updated automatically. (save button is enabled and then disabled) If re-open the design, it is same as before.

The code path for preview inside the editor has not been changed.

You will see the same issue if preview using toolbar button, That is caused by a previous generated report document (you won't see any popup parameter dialog if report doc exists.) and it will be fixed later after viewer/designer integration.
This bug has no relationship with that update state changes of designer.
That changes happens yesterday, but this bug report at Dec 05.

After applied the changes to 119542, this issue is not reproducable. Please verify.
not reproducible with latest source of 12/7.
Verified in build 20051208.
I found this problem again in build 20051209.

If I want to remove the rptdocument, I need to close Eclipse first. After reopen it, the new modification takes effect. The parameter dialog pops up.
But If I didn't reopen Eclipse, after editing report, preview in html, no parameter dialog pops up.

so you use the viewer in a seperate browser not inside editor? If so the issue you see is caused by 120019. You can temporarily manually remove the generated report doc .rptdocument file each time you try to viewer the report.

Please verify whether this is the case.

The first time I preview the report in html viewer, it works properly. Then I change back to layout editor and edit the report, then preview in html viewer again. It still generated the original result without any modification.

    <WithStack>Changing the font size in Internet Explorer doesn't change the size of the font on the Eclipse home page(eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.0.1/doc/home_page.html). 

We tracked down the problem to the following line of the book.css stylesheet that the home_page.html uses:

/* following font size declarations should be OK for DBCS */
body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, table, td, caption, th, ul, ol, dl, li, dd, dt {font-size: 10pt; }

It looks like this locks the font at 10pt, and doesn't allow it to be scaled.

We was able to fix it myself by maing these changes:

-Set the font size to 1em instead of 10pt.  Sizes specified in ems can be resized in IE.
	body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, table, td, caption, th, ul, ol, dl, li, dd, dt {font-size: 1em; }

-1 em is too big as a default size, so I scaled down the body font size to 80%.
	body	     { background: #FFFFFF; font-size:80%;}

I don't know if this was the best way to fix it, but it did seem to work.

    <WithStack>I am running into a problem in load-time weaving when I use reflection delegates because the weaver is generating an incorrect bridge method when I perform an inter-type declaration on Struts.ActionServlet for the init method. On investigation, the BCEL world is recognizing this as an overriding method, because its version of getDeclaredMethods is returning the declared methods for all ancestor superclasses. However, the reflection world is returning only the declared methods for this one class. It therefore appears that the weaver expects getDeclaredMethods to return all of them (making the name quite misleading). I think previously the method was being implemented inconsistently between 1.5 reflection and &lt;1.5 reflection delegates. But it looks like it needs to be handled consistently to include all superclass methods.

However, I don’t know what other places (e.g., the MAP) are really expecting getDeclaredMethods and its siblings to behave like Java reflection's version…

I started work on adding a getAllDeclaredMethods method to ReferenceType and delegates, as an alternative to provide the weaver the ability to check method overriding as in this case, but it's a little bit involved and I wanted to flag the issue first.

Here's a test that fails and illustrates the issue:

Two small clarifications: the incorrect bridge method results in a VerifyError. If I use only BCEL delegates then the system behaves properly.
I modified the test program to output what the differences are between the two sets.  Interesting results:

Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init(int) in the bcel set
Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init() in the bcel set
Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init(java.util.Map) in the bcel set
Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init(int, float) in the bcel set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;(int, float) in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;(int) in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;() in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;(java.util.Map) in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;clinit&gt;() in the reflection set

I don't like the disagreement between the 'init' and '&lt;init&gt;' strings.  I suspect that is the root of this problem.  I'm not sure about the &lt;clinit&gt; - but at least we know that can't have an impact on bridge methods ;)

I'm not sure how this quite ties up with Rons description that getDeclaredMethods() is differing in each case as the initial fix here just seems to be transforming the reflection based entries for ctors to indicate &lt;init&gt;...

Patch to the delegates (1.5 and &lt; 1.5)

Ron ... this zip contains two patches, one for the weaver project, one for weaver5 - can you try it out and see if it helps your situation with the rogue bridge method?  Basically I've made the reflection world return the same thing as the bcel world.  The test I modified still fails because of the &lt;clinit&gt; method but that shouldnt impact bridge method creation.
Hmmm .. I just re-read the original append by Ron.

In my case I wasn't getting 41 and 29, I was getting 41 and 40.

perhaps I'm not running it in quite the same way - i'll keep hacking away - but if you could try the patch it might help with the bridge problem.
I will try the patches and report back...

On closer examination, the 29 vs 41 methods I was seeing was on a Java 1.3.1 VM but running in Eclipse where the Java 1.5 JRE was on the classpath and BCEL was using that to resolve types (!). When corrected to use a 1.3 JRE in Eclipse, I see 29 vs 30 methods on a Java 1.3 VM and I always saw 40 vs 41 on a Java 1.5 VM. Hopefully this test will show 29 vs 30 when run via ant (the docs on how to run ant tests for a module from the command line aren't working for me...)

It looks like those patches fix the problem (although I had to patch the patches to use an IReflectionWorld interface that my LTWWorld implementation also implements :-)). I am not seeing the same error messages and things appear to be working properly on a quick run. Thanks!

    <WithOutStack>I am running into a problem in load-time weaving when I use reflection delegates because the weaver is generating an incorrect bridge method when I perform an inter-type declaration on Struts.ActionServlet for the init method. On investigation, the BCEL world is recognizing this as an overriding method, because its version of getDeclaredMethods is returning the declared methods for all ancestor superclasses. However, the reflection world is returning only the declared methods for this one class. It therefore appears that the weaver expects getDeclaredMethods to return all of them (making the name quite misleading). I think previously the method was being implemented inconsistently between 1.5 reflection and &lt;1.5 reflection delegates. But it looks like it needs to be handled consistently to include all superclass methods.

However, I don’t know what other places (e.g., the MAP) are really expecting getDeclaredMethods and its siblings to behave like Java reflection's version…

I started work on adding a getAllDeclaredMethods method to ReferenceType and delegates, as an alternative to provide the weaver the ability to check method overriding as in this case, but it's a little bit involved and I wanted to flag the issue first.

Here's a test that fails and illustrates the issue:

This results in:

Two small clarifications: the incorrect bridge method results in a VerifyError. If I use only BCEL delegates then the system behaves properly.
I modified the test program to output what the differences are between the two sets.  Interesting results:

Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init(int) in the bcel set
Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init() in the bcel set
Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init(java.util.Map) in the bcel set
Couldn't find java.util.HashMap java.util.HashMap.init(int, float) in the bcel set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;(int, float) in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;(int) in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;() in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;init&gt;(java.util.Map) in the reflection set
Couldn't find void java.util.HashMap.&lt;clinit&gt;() in the reflection set

I don't like the disagreement between the 'init' and '&lt;init&gt;' strings.  I suspect that is the root of this problem.  I'm not sure about the &lt;clinit&gt; - but at least we know that can't have an impact on bridge methods ;)

I'm not sure how this quite ties up with Rons description that getDeclaredMethods() is differing in each case as the initial fix here just seems to be transforming the reflection based entries for ctors to indicate &lt;init&gt;...
Created attachment 31379
Patch to the delegates (1.5 and &lt; 1.5)

Ron ... this zip contains two patches, one for the weaver project, one for weaver5 - can you try it out and see if it helps your situation with the rogue bridge method?  Basically I've made the reflection world return the same thing as the bcel world.  The test I modified still fails because of the &lt;clinit&gt; method but that shouldnt impact bridge method creation.
Hmmm .. I just re-read the original append by Ron.

This has already been fixed and released last night. Please note though that you will be fighting with the runtime selection combo for the control of the facets list. When the user picks a runtime on the first page, the facets list will reset.
This change is a bulk update of all _un_targeted, fixed, resolved bugs upon release of M5. This particular bug _might_ have been fixed earlier than M5. (Feel free to correct). 


This bug is being moved to the "closed" state since it has been in the fixed state for a so long it is being assumed fixed, without explicit verification from the originator. If there is still a problem, in the most recent 1.5.x builds, please reopen or open another bug.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>SWT's ImageData class is used to create Image objects to render on-screen.
For applications that use the AWT Image, BufferedImage, and Java Advanced Imaging APIs to manipulate image data, the current implementation of ImageData forces the application to do an explicit conversion from the AWT Raster/ColorModel/DataBuffer object data to the ImageData/PaletteData objects, which incurs extra work copying the pixels and related data and also costs twice the memory to maintain both image objects.

It would be a big improvement for applications that still need to use the AWT Raster-based objects to be able to build an SWT ImageData object that wrapped an AWT Raster object.  The ImageData object could share the same array of pixels as the Raster's DataBuffer, and the ColorModel is straightforward to convert to an equivalent PaletteData object.  This implementation is given in Snippet 156: http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet156.java?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup,
(which, by the way, should be updated to include awt images that use a ComponentColorModel.)

This enhancement would be a huge win for image processing and image manipulation applications that use SWT for rendering since it would eliminate unnecessary conversion and also eliminate making additional copies of image data.
Realistically, I can't really see us doing this.  SWT runs on platforms where AWT doesn't exist (QNX Photon).

Is there a particular ImageData feature that is missing from SWT?

&gt; AWT doesn't exist (QNX Photon).
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a particular ImageData feature that is missing from SWT?
&gt; 

It's most unfortunate then that SWT image rendering is apparently so fundamentally incompatible (at the API level) with what is now the most prevalent image processing and manipulation API available for Java.

Java Advanced Imaging and ImageIO APIs care nothing whatsoever for rendering graphics, only producing device-independent images from data sources and transforms of other images.  The Java Advanced Imaging API provides a generic image processing operation chain with support for deferred execution, tile-based image operations, flexible caching support, and even native acceleration on some platforms.  ImageIO provides an extensible, flexible API for reading and writing image data from files and other data sources in a wide variety of formats and provides an API for writing plugins for other formats if you need them.  It also provides an object model for image metadata and can encode, decode, and transcode that metadata between formats.  

Sorry if the above sounds like a commercial for JAI and ImageIO, but these libraries are to image processing and i/o handling what SWT is to creating GUIs...and marrying them up currently requires a lot of wasted memory and time.  I know you are constantly concerned with memory footprint and performance issues with SWT, so I know you can appreciate this.

Is there any particular feature lacking in ImageData, you ask?  Well, it is far less generalized than Raster and its supporting classes.  SampleModels can have an arbitrary number of bands in an image and can arrange the pixels in a number of ways like band-interleaved, pixel-interleaved, and multi-pixel-per-sample.  DataBuffers can support a wider variety of data types for pixels (byte, short, unsigned short, int, float).  ColorModels can be not just Direct or Indexed but ComponentColorModels defined with a ColorSpace.

If you can't allow a class in SWT to refer to a class in AWT because you need to support platforms without AWT, then could you please make ImageData extensible and essentially a clone of AWT Raster, SampleModel, ColorModel, and DataBuffer so that other APIs could wrap AWT Raster objects as ImageData objects, and save considerable memory (usually tens or hundreds of megabytes) and stop spending time converting to the current ImageData image representation in the bargain?  This seems like a lot to ask of you, but I fail to see another option at present...it's a shame that my original request wasn't more straightforward.

Thanks for the description of JAI and ImageIO.  It is unlikely that we will clone this API, although the functionality sounds interesting.

Is there a particular feature or API that is missing in SWT, something that is holding you up and stopping you from shipping a product?

&gt; Thanks for the description of JAI and ImageIO.  It is unlikely that we will

I would encourage you not to try to clone this API, since it represents years of development by the team who created it.  Ideally, these libraries would be best used integrated with SWT rather than being replaced by it.

&gt; Is there a particular feature or API that is missing in SWT, something that is

Well we're "shipping" our product currently, it's just more bloated than it should be because we need to make SWT copies of every tiled image that we make using JAI.

Just the product that I help develop.  I'll be presenting a long talk at EclipseCon 2006  titled "NASA Mission Operations with the Rich Client Platform" where you can see it demonstrated, or I can demonstrated it to you personally.

I can give you an architectural description of the application, but I can't give you a copy of it at this time since it's not my intellectual property.  Hopefully that will change in the future.  If an architectural description of how image data is being used in my application (which is likely the case for many applications that use JAI) and how it is being converted into SWT Images would be useful, let me know and I will attach one here.
&gt;Well we're "shipping" our product currently, it's just more bloated than

&gt;Just the product that I help develop ...

Several ideas come to mind:  Are you really using all the features of JAI?  It might be possible to implement a subset of the feature that you use for your application.  How about using the SWT_AWT bridge to mock up a JAI and AWT prototype to see how much time and space might be saved by using only JAI and AWT?  That way there will be no conversion.

Also, I'm quite interested in the NASA work and will be sure to attend your talk.  I'm very interested in any concrete problems that you are having.

We use a lot of what JAI gives us...we really can't do without it.  The tile cache alone is a critical piece of infrastructure for us, not to mention the 20+ image operations that we need to use, including a handful of custom JAI operations that we maintain ourselves.

Oh if only we could have done this when we first moved to Eclipse...!  The deal-breaker for us on this was, is, and continues to be Mac support for the bridge which isn't there.  There was also a problem we were having with using a Swing component to do this on GTK that I filed way back when (Bug 74095), but we've stopped using the bridge entirely since the majority of our users are on Macs.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, I'm quite interested in the NASA work and will be sure to attend your
&gt; talk.  I'm very interested in any concrete problems that you are having.
&gt; 

Thanks!  We can clearly see how interested you are since your team has worked so hard on many of the SWT features that we have asked for in the past, notably the OpenGL binding support which we're very excited to see :)

Here's an example of what we do and how we do it that is hopefully concrete enough for a meaningful discussion:

Say we have a big image that is 10,000 by 10,000 pixels in size, which is 100,000,000 (100M) pixels, 1 byte per pixel (greyscale).  If we want to render this image with SWT in the most naive implementation possible, one would build one huge SWT image that was 100M in size, and have a Canvas in a Shell that calls gc.drawImage(bigSWTImage) with every paint that would crop and/or scale the image to the viewport coordinates to show the part of the image that you want at the scale that you want.  Building that 100M image is a huge hit on memory resources, and you can't build too many of these before you run out of RAM.

A tried-and-true design to get around the need to build entire huge images is to build them in pieces (called tiles) on demand.  If you want to view an image, you load it and break it up into tiles.  If the image is much bigger than the shell, as it often is, then you only build the tiles that are visible.  As you scroll the Canvas and expose areas that haven't been computed yet, you start a thread to build the tiles you need for the exposed region and then paint them when you're done.  You keep all the tiles in an LRU cache in memory with a maximum size that forces the cache to dispose tiles that are least recently used when the cache fills up.  The maximum size has to be at least big enough to hold enough tiles to paint the entire Shell, and other than that it's a trade-off between painting performance and memory usage.  For a good example of an image rendering app that uses a strategy like this, look at how http://maps.google.com looks when it renders.  The implementation behind Google Maps isn't exactly what I'm describing here, but the presentation layer is similar enough to illustrate how my application looks and feels without you actually seeing it.  The GIMP is another good example of an imaging application that uses a tile cache for its processing and rendering that lets it scale well to very large images.

Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) has a good tile cache implementation, plus it also has a host of image processing support algorithms that are important for other features of my particular application to do image analysis.  My customers are scientists and analysts who are trying to analyze images of the surface of Mars, the Moon, Earth's oceans, etc. using images from cameras and spectrometers mounted on a spacecraft and use what they learn to affect changes to the course of a spacecraft in the span of a few hours or less.  As a result, we use quite a bit of the JAI feature set pretty extensively to provide these features in our app, and not using it isn't really an option at present.

However, JAI produces tiles that are AWT RenderedImage objects, which map roughly to SWT Image objects in terms of what they contain...They are basically an array of pixels and a ColorModel, although the AWT objects are more general and flexible when you put them side-by-side and compare features.  For instance, an AWT RenderedImage can represent an image that cannot be directly rendered to a display device (such as an image with more than 8 bits per color channel, or an image of floating point pixel values).  I would not suggest, however, that SWT add support for these types of images that cannot be directly displayed, since that seems to diverge pretty far from what SWT's charter is.

I think that SWT Images probably map more directly to AWT BufferedImage objects, since they are primarily intended to represent images that can be rendered on a display (although via Java2D).  Originally, I was hoping that if I had an AWT BufferedImage object that internally contained an array of pixels that was organized exactly like the pixels are organized for an SWT Image object, that the SWT Image object could "wrap" that array of pixels rather than make a copy of it in memory.  

To further concretize the issue, I'll go back to the scenario that I originally mentioned. If I start with a 100M AWT RendreredImage built with JAI that I can't render on a display and convert it entirely to an SWT Image that I can render on a display, I have to pay an extra 100M of RAM just to copy all the pixels--even if the copy of the pixel array is exactly like that array that I originally had.

Let's say next that we have a more intelligent implementation that makes tiles out of big images and only renders the tiles that are exposed in a Viewport in a ScrolledComposite in a Shell.  If my shell is as big as a display, I still need ~10-20M worth of tiles to have enough tiles to cover the entire the display (obviously this depends on the size of the display, but in a case of a dual-monitor workstation with an effective resolution of 3200x1200 pixels and 32-bit color display, that's ~15.3 M worth of pixels.  

What I was trying to ask for in this feature request was for SWT to support a way for me to be clever and build my AWT RenderedImage in a way that would be compatible with the pixel organization that SWT Image uses, and just let the SWT Image object be a wrapper around the pixel data that I made in the AWT RenderedImage.

I understand that adding an java.awt dependency into SWT is problematic for some of the platforms that it supports.  Maybe an alternative that would work would be to devise an API similar to the SWT_AWT bridge that allows an SWT Image to be built from an AWT RenderedImage?  Given a set of reasonable constraints on what types of RenderedImage objects an SWT Image would accept, could this be done in a way that doesn't create problems for platforms that lack a java.awt implementation?  BTW, how is this handled in the case of the SWT_AWT bridge API on these platforms that refers to java.awt.Frame in the API?
Given that you want to manipulate and manage a large amount of pixel data, using some representation separate from SWT seems reasonable to me.

However, you will always need to perform both a format conversion and at least one data copy when you want to actually push some pixels to the display.  An SWT Image is a handle to an operating system image, already formatted for display, and ideally in video memory already.  This is the target, and there are two problems:

  1. Reduce data bandwidth and memory by only converting those pixels to
     Images that you intend to actually display.
  2. Reduce CPU time by doing as few format conversions as possible.

In SWT, pixel data is transferred via an ImageData object which supports a fixed set of formats.  This potentially incurs one extra copy and conversion of the pixel data you want to display, and it is up to the client to ensure they don't create more Image and ImageData objects than they require.

I suspect that there are ways you can optimize your pipeline before the ImageData conversion becomes the limiting factor, but already you should be able to create an ImageData object and give it the pixel array if you have one around.  This should be optimal.  Having a benchmark or test case that shows exactly where you are having problems would help.
There is a ton of information in your response that I hope to get to.  For now, we are looking into getting rid of some of the copying.  Billy is right, we need example code.  For example, do your image start out as AWT images?  Please attach some representative code for us to work with.
I believe there is enough API already to share the data buffers between AWT and SWT as long as a java.awt.image.DataBufferByte is used. Have a look at this msg. It has code that tries to do something like that.

This looks like it may be just what I was looking for :)

I've been using the approach that the code in Snippet156 uses to convert my images which makes a copy of the pixel array, but what this code example is doing avoids the copy entirely.  I'm going to give this a try as soon as I can...in theory it should do exactly what I want.

Many, many thanks for pointing this out...I wish I had thought of this a year ago...

In return, I will turn this into a code snippet and send it back to you guys attached to this thread so that others can use it too.

... and we will make it into a snippet for the page.
Mark,

What has your experience been with that code?  It still seems to me that creating an Image from ImageData still does not share the data buffer, but merely accomplishes the copying more concisely.  It was quite a while ago that I looked at this, but my experience was that creating the Image this way is still not really satisfactorily fast enough not to have to cache the resulting SWT Image.

I'm wondering if what might be more feasible is an AWT wrapper around an SWT Image instead of the other way around.  Holongate appears to be working with such a solution - have you played with that?  My interest overlaps yours quite a bit (see bug 92626), although I haven't really been able to work on it yet.  I'd really value any discoveries you make!

Cheers,
Ian

This example builds a BufferedImage and wraps it with an SWT Image and renders it in various ways.  It's adapted from the image rotate example originally written by Pratik Shah.

This example builds a JAI TiledImage and wraps it with an SWT Image and renders it in various ways. It's adapted from the image rotate example originally written by Pratik Shah.

This example requires Java Advanced Imaging 1.1 or later to build/run.
The previous two posts are some examples I cooked up during EclipseCon 2006 (fun stuff) that are runnable as SWT snippets.  The BufferedImage one is straightforward to run, but the JAI TiledImage one requires JAI 1.1 or later to build/run.

The main point of providing these examples is to explicitly show that copying pixels from AWT Image objects to SWT Image objects isn't strictly necessary.  Snippet 156 is an example of how to convert between these Image objects using a copy.

I also wanted to mention for those of you who happened to listeend to my talk that the thing about the BGR vs. RGB that I mentioned may not really be that big of a deal in general...after all, you can just pick any bands for red, green, and blue when you construct the PaletteData to specify a direct color model, so if you happen to have created an AWT or JAI image with some intrinsic ordering (RGB, BGR, whatever) and just construct a PaletteData to match it.

Ian Graham made a good point that during the conversion from ImageData to Image, the order of bands in the pixel array may matter in terms of performance impact.  For anyone who's concerned with how to build device-dependent Images from ImageData objects in the Java heap with maximum performance, it may be worthwhile to look at the source and maybe point a profiler at it to measure whether this matters...ideally on several platforms for comparison.  If I'm not the first one to find time to do this, I'd love to know what others may have already discovered in this area.</WithStack>

There was also a problem we were having with using a Swing component to do this on GTK that I filed way back when (Bug 74095), but we've stopped using the bridge entirely since the majority of our users are on Macs.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, I'm quite interested in the NASA work and will be sure to attend your
&gt; talk.  I'm very interested in any concrete problems that you are having.
&gt; 

Thanks!  We can clearly see how interested you are since your team has worked so hard on many of the SWT features that we have asked for in the past, notably the OpenGL binding support which we're very excited to see :)

Here's an example of what we do and how we do it that is hopefully concrete enough for a meaningful discussion:

Say we have a big image that is 10,000 by 10,000 pixels in size, which is 100,000,000 (100M) pixels, 1 byte per pixel (greyscale).  If we want to render this image with SWT in the most naive implementation possible, one would build one huge SWT image that was 100M in size, and have a Canvas in a Shell that calls gc.drawImage(bigSWTImage) with every paint that would crop and/or scale the image to the viewport coordinates to show the part of the image that you want at the scale that you want.  Building that 100M image is a huge hit on memory resources, and you can't build too many of these before you run out of RAM.

A tried-and-true design to get around the need to build entire huge images is to build them in pieces (called tiles) on demand.  If you want to view an image, you load it and break it up into tiles.  If the image is much bigger than the shell, as it often is, then you only build the tiles that are visible.  As you scroll the Canvas and expose areas that haven't been computed yet, you start a thread to build the tiles you need for the exposed region and then paint them when you're done.  You keep all the tiles in an LRU cache in memory with a maximum size that forces the cache to dispose tiles that are least recently used when the cache fills up.  The maximum size has to be at least big enough to hold enough tiles to paint the entire Shell, and other than that it's a trade-off between painting performance and memory usage.  For a good example of an image rendering app that uses a strategy like this, look at how http://maps.google.com looks when it renders.  The implementation behind Google Maps isn't exactly what I'm describing here, but the presentation layer is similar enough to illustrate how my application looks and feels without you actually seeing it.  The GIMP is another good example of an imaging application that uses a tile cache for its processing and rendering that lets it scale well to very large images.

Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) has a good tile cache implementation, plus it also has a host of image processing support algorithms that are important for other features of my particular application to do image analysis.  My customers are scientists and analysts who are trying to analyze images of the surface of Mars, the Moon, Earth's oceans, etc. using images from cameras and spectrometers mounted on a spacecraft and use what they learn to affect changes to the course of a spacecraft in the span of a few hours or less.  As a result, we use quite a bit of the JAI feature set pretty extensively to provide these features in our app, and not using it isn't really an option at present.

However, JAI produces tiles that are AWT RenderedImage objects, which map roughly to SWT Image objects in terms of what they contain...They are basically an array of pixels and a ColorModel, although the AWT objects are more general and flexible when you put them side-by-side and compare features.  For instance, an AWT RenderedImage can represent an image that cannot be directly rendered to a display device (such as an image with more than 8 bits per color channel, or an image of floating point pixel values).  I would not suggest, however, that SWT add support for these types of images that cannot be directly displayed, since that seems to diverge pretty far from what SWT's charter is.

I think that SWT Images probably map more directly to AWT BufferedImage objects, since they are primarily intended to represent images that can be rendered on a display (although via Java2D).  Originally, I was hoping that if I had an AWT BufferedImage object that internally contained an array of pixels that was organized exactly like the pixels are organized for an SWT Image object, that the SWT Image object could "wrap" that array of pixels rather than make a copy of it in memory.  

To further concretize the issue, I'll go back to the scenario that I originally mentioned. If I start with a 100M AWT RendreredImage built with JAI that I can't render on a display and convert it entirely to an SWT Image that I can render on a display, I have to pay an extra 100M of RAM just to copy all the pixels--even if the copy of the pixel array is exactly like that array that I originally had.

Let's say next that we have a more intelligent implementation that makes tiles out of big images and only renders the tiles that are exposed in a Viewport in a ScrolledComposite in a Shell.  If my shell is as big as a display, I still need ~10-20M worth of tiles to have enough tiles to cover the entire the display (obviously this depends on the size of the display, but in a case of a dual-monitor workstation with an effective resolution of 3200x1200 pixels and 32-bit color display, that's ~15.3 M worth of pixels.  

What I was trying to ask for in this feature request was for SWT to support a way for me to be clever and build my AWT RenderedImage in a way that would be compatible with the pixel organization that SWT Image uses, and just let the SWT Image object be a wrapper around the pixel data that I made in the AWT RenderedImage.

I understand that adding an java.awt dependency into SWT is problematic for some of the platforms that it supports.  Maybe an alternative that would work would be to devise an API similar to the SWT_AWT bridge that allows an SWT Image to be built from an AWT RenderedImage?  Given a set of reasonable constraints on what types of RenderedImage objects an SWT Image would accept, could this be done in a way that doesn't create problems for platforms that lack a java.awt implementation?  BTW, how is this handled in the case of the SWT_AWT bridge API on these platforms that refers to java.awt.Frame in the API?
Given that you want to manipulate and manage a large amount of pixel data, using some representation separate from SWT seems reasonable to me.

However, you will always need to perform both a format conversion and at least one data copy when you want to actually push some pixels to the display.  An SWT Image is a handle to an operating system image, already formatted for display, and ideally in video memory already.  This is the target, and there are two problems:

  1. Reduce data bandwidth and memory by only converting those pixels to
     Images that you intend to actually display.
  2. Reduce CPU time by doing as few format conversions as possible.

In SWT, pixel data is transferred via an ImageData object which supports a fixed set of formats.  This potentially incurs one extra copy and conversion of the pixel data you want to display, and it is up to the client to ensure they don't create more Image and ImageData objects than they require.

I suspect that there are ways you can optimize your pipeline before the ImageData conversion becomes the limiting factor, but already you should be able to create an ImageData object and give it the pixel array if you have one around.  This should be optimal.  Having a benchmark or test case that shows exactly where you are having problems would help.
There is a ton of information in your response that I hope to get to.  For now, we are looking into getting rid of some of the copying.  Billy is right, we need example code.  For example, do your image start out as AWT images?  Please attach some representative code for us to work with.
I believe there is enough API already to share the data buffers between AWT and SWT as long as a java.awt.image.DataBufferByte is used. Have a look at this msg. It has code that tries to do something like that.

This looks like it may be just what I was looking for :)

I've been using the approach that the code in Snippet156 uses to convert my images which makes a copy of the pixel array, but what this code example is doing avoids the copy entirely.  I'm going to give this a try as soon as I can...in theory it should do exactly what I want.

Many, many thanks for pointing this out...I wish I had thought of this a year ago...

In return, I will turn this into a code snippet and send it back to you guys attached to this thread so that others can use it too.

... and we will make it into a snippet for the page.
Mark,

What has your experience been with that code?  It still seems to me that creating an Image from ImageData still does not share the data buffer, but merely accomplishes the copying more concisely.  It was quite a while ago that I looked at this, but my experience was that creating the Image this way is still not really satisfactorily fast enough not to have to cache the resulting SWT Image.

I'm wondering if what might be more feasible is an AWT wrapper around an SWT Image instead of the other way around.  Holongate appears to be working with such a solution - have you played with that?  My interest overlaps yours quite a bit (see bug 92626), although I haven't really been able to work on it yet.  I'd really value any discoveries you make!

Cheers,
Ian

This example builds a BufferedImage and wraps it with an SWT Image and renders it in various ways.  It's adapted from the image rotate example originally written by Pratik Shah.

This example builds a JAI TiledImage and wraps it with an SWT Image and renders it in various ways. It's adapted from the image rotate example originally written by Pratik Shah.

This example requires Java Advanced Imaging 1.1 or later to build/run.
The previous two posts are some examples I cooked up during EclipseCon 2006 (fun stuff) that are runnable as SWT snippets.  The BufferedImage one is straightforward to run, but the JAI TiledImage one requires JAI 1.1 or later to build/run.

The main point of providing these examples is to explicitly show that copying pixels from AWT Image objects to SWT Image objects isn't strictly necessary.  Snippet 156 is an example of how to convert between these Image objects using a copy.

I also wanted to mention for those of you who happened to listeend to my talk that the thing about the BGR vs. RGB that I mentioned may not really be that big of a deal in general...after all, you can just pick any bands for red, green, and blue when you construct the PaletteData to specify a direct color model, so if you happen to have created an AWT or JAI image with some intrinsic ordering (RGB, BGR, whatever) and just construct a PaletteData to match it.

Ian Graham made a good point that during the conversion from ImageData to Image, the order of bands in the pixel array may matter in terms of performance impact.  For anyone who's concerned with how to build device-dependent Images from ImageData objects in the Java heap with maximum performance, it may be worthwhile to look at the source and maybe point a profiler at it to measure whether this matters...ideally on several platforms for comparison.  If I'm not the first one to find time to do this, I'd love to know what others may have already discovered in this area.</WithOutStack>

Eclipse version:3.1.0

&lt;&lt;Steps To Reproduce&gt;&gt;
     1, Launch the Help.
     2, Search for 'help not ecli' (no quotes). 
     3, click the hits to see the highlighted search words.

&lt;&lt;Actual Result&gt;&gt;
    The substring "ecli "of "eclipse"  is  highlighted.

&lt;&lt;Expected Result&gt;&gt;
    The substring "ecli "of "eclipse" should not be highlighted.

&lt;&lt;Cause&gt;&gt;
  In QueryBuilder, the tokens after "NOT" is added to highlight terms too.  

&lt;&lt;Solution&gt;&gt;
  When the search word tokens is after "NOT", Do not add it to highlight terms.

OS: windows XP professional
Eclipse version:3.1.0

&lt;&lt;Steps To Reproduce&gt;&gt;
     1, Launch the Help.
     2, Search for 'help not ecli' (no quotes). 
     3, click the hits to see the highlighted search words.

&lt;&lt;Actual Result&gt;&gt;
    The substring "ecli "of "eclipse"  is  highlighted.

&lt;&lt;Expected Result&gt;&gt;
    The substring "ecli "of "eclipse" should not be highlighted.

&lt;&lt;Cause&gt;&gt;
  In QueryBuilder, the tokens after "NOT" is added to highlight terms too.  

&lt;&lt;Solution&gt;&gt;
  When the search word tokens is after "NOT", Do not add it to highlight terms.

Patch
Patch looks good, I have tested it without any problems. I revised it a little to simpify and make the formatting more consistent with the rest of the code.

Unfortunately I'm getting errors while trying to post the new patch, so I'll add it here as text:

The problem is when I start eclipse and the http/web auth popup appears, if I press escape/click cancel rather than entering the login/pass, it completely freezes eclipse. Even if it does crash, shouldn't this operation be non-modal anyway...?
That popup does not come from Mylar or the Bugzilla Client, but from the browser or java.net.  But I will look into making the client more defensive to this issue when resolving the corresponding report.

    <WithStack>We are using gdb's "monitor" commands to query some internal information of our debug target. The guidelines in the gdb manual are to extend the serial protocol by modifying the gdb stub (only, without modifying gdb) to understand new monitor commands. Monitor commands are sent as

$qRcmd 

packets. Responses are to be sent as "$O" packets. gdb outputs these with the token "@", i.e. as belonging to the target output stream. Here is a sample of "monitor mbox", a newly introduced command which reports the status the OS's mailboxes:

=======snip==================
[1,133,772,933,238] (gdb)
[1,133,772,936,751] 61 monitor mbox
[1,133,772,936,753] &amp;"monitor mbox\n"
[1,133,772,936,787] @"Box at 0x320dd56c: 0 messages\n"
[1,133,772,936,798] @"Total 1 boxes\n"
[1,133,772,936,802] 61^done
[1,133,772,936,803] (gdb)
=======snap==================

Now in order to use this command from eclipse and populate a new debug view from the output we created the usual CLICommand - MIInfo pair and posted the command via the MISession. Everything works fine except that the records containing the real information are not there. They are not collected in 

org.eclipse.cdt.debug.mi.core.RxThread.processMIOOBRecord(MIStreamRecord stream)

where the three possible output streams are processed. The current implementation is:

Console stream output: echo to console and collect as OOB record.
Log     stream output: echo to console and collect as OOB record.
Target  stream output: just echo to console.

The proposal is to add collecting as OOB record to the third alternative. This will make the output of any monitor commands that are present in a target, or that can be added by extending the gdb stub, available for automatic processing in the CDT debugging framework.
Alternate implementation suggestion from Mikhail Khodjaiants:

&gt; The alternative solution would be the addition of a special MI command for 
this. Is it doable?

I would rather have the enhancement along the lines I suggested above for the following reasons:

1) The proposal needs to extend the gdb stub only. The stub is made for adaptation and the adaptation procedure is described in the manual so we are assured that the gdb folk are aware of and will be supporting our approach.

2) The proposal makes existing "monitor" commands available for CDT debug views along with those which are newly created.

Just a simple question: do you need this for 3.0.2 or 3.1?
No special hurry, I can go by using a patched version of RxThread. I just want to be sure that it will not be forgotten on the long road to version 3.1. 

I understand that fixes for 3.1 go to HEAD and that there is a branch for 3.0.2 and I guess I am happiest if you do the fix now, although it's sufficient to do it in HEAD only.

Thanks a lot!

What if do it this way: I'll set the target milestone to 3.1 and you try the patched version and we'll see if there are some side effects. I didn't write this code and I'm not very comfortable changing it until I learn more.
Is this OK with you?
Fine, just let me know when you've applied the patches.
Hey Michail,

with my changed status I could now do the patch in case you don't find the time. Shall I?

Norbert, 
Currently, I am making major changes in mi plugins and I don't want to commit it until I am done with it. Merging is a pain and takes a lot of time. Please, wait I'll let you know when it is save.

Supporting the GDB "monitor" command is an important feature for embedded development.

Seems to work fine on my rocket.

I'm using a BDI 2000 JTAG debugger and I took some simple "monitor" commands for a spin.


(gdb) monitor info
    Core number       : 0
    Core state        : debug mode (ARM)
    Debug entry cause : Breakpoint
    Current PC        : 0x0103fc00
    Current CPSR      : 0x20000013 (Supervisor)

Marking as fixed. Thanks, Norbert.
I had a question regarding this fix.  So when I type "monitor test" will whatever "monitor test" returns be displayed on eclipse console?  Or is this only to be passed to MIInfo?  If it is suppose to be displayed onto the eclipse console than I'm pretty sure the fix does not work.  I just wanted to sure as to what exactly it is suppose to do before going on.  Hope I didn't waste too much of everyone's time.

Mitchell,

the purpose of the fix was to get target stream output records into the MIInfo object which can be processed when the target responds to a (monitor) command. The fix does not intend to change the console behavior.
From taking a look at the code I think that the application output should appear in a console, though probably not in the gdb command line console. Alas, I do not have a live example handy and I am not very deeply familiar with the code.
Maybe you should post your question on the mailing list if you think there is something wrong with the behavior.
(In reply to comment #11)
Norbert, what is supposed to happen in this case? We don't use the "monitor" command and I don't have a test case. Didn't you submit it to solve a problem with your implementation? So, does it work for you or not?

&gt; command and I don't have a test case. Didn't you submit it to solve a problem
&gt; with your implementation? So, does it work for you or not?

I am populating a self-made view from the output of the monitor command. 
- The debug view registers for debug events. (DebugPlugin.addDebugEventListener()).
- When a suspend event is fired (DebugEvent.SUSPEND) a worker thread creates a monitor command object (derived from CLICommand) and posts it to the MISession (MISession.postCommand()).
- The thread then calls Command.getMIInfo() which makes it wait until the command is finished.
- RxThread collects all text which is returned as output in response to the command and puts it into an MIInfo object in the form of out-of-band records (MIOOBRecord). 
- This is where the bugfix comes in: Only after the fix is the target stream output stored in the MIInfo object and can be processed by the view's worker thread when it returns from MIInfo().

So in short:
- Yes, the fix solves a problem, namely to make target stream output available to debug event listeners and
- Yes, it works for me.

I did not need a console echo of the output and I do not remember (this is now about 6 months past) whether there was a console echo.
Alas, my debug view was not used much since then and I do not have a testing scenario handy to see what happens.
Sorry for the confusion. I was under the impression that the fix also enabled the monitor output to eclipse gdb console.  But anyways, the fix does what it is suppose to do.  Again, sorry for the confusion.

Sorry to awaken this thread again...

I am using the "monitor" commands to collect additional information from an embedded target. It is working OK, except that the response is appearing in the console, and I can't disable it.

In RxThread#processMIOOBRecord, for objects of class MIConsoleStreamOutput and MILogStreamOutput, isEnableConsole() is checked before writing to the console, but for MITargetStreamOutput it is not and so the output is alwsys written.

I can't (and don't want to) change GDB. Any suggestions?

Thanks,

&gt; console, and I can't disable it.
&gt; but for MITargetStreamOutput it is not and so the output is alwsys written.

I agree to your analysis. Bug or feature? that's the question. It could make sense that the target's output stream is written (it is the "standard output" of the debugged application after all) while gdb churn around it is filtered out. If you use the isEnableConsole() method also for the target output stream then you can have either app output plus gdb churn or nothing at all.

But I don't have a usecase where this would hurt me. So I suggest you

- create a new bugzilla for your request - this bugzilla is related, but not quite the same as yours.
- try to start a discussion in the cdt-dev list. If there are no negative replies, why not treat the target output stream like all the others.

This fix creates a memory leak for the duration of the target run. The total memory used is proportional to the print output of the target... see bug 302927</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>We are using gdb's "monitor" commands to query some internal information of our debug target. The guidelines in the gdb manual are to extend the serial protocol by modifying the gdb stub (only, without modifying gdb) to understand new monitor commands. Monitor commands are sent as

$qRcmd 

packets. Responses are to be sent as "$O" packets. gdb outputs these with the token "@", i.e. as belonging to the target output stream. Here is a sample of "monitor mbox", a newly introduced command which reports the status the OS's mailboxes:

=======snip==================
[1,133,772,933,238] (gdb)
[1,133,772,936,751] 61 monitor mbox
[1,133,772,936,753] &amp;"monitor mbox\n"
[1,133,772,936,787] @"Box at 0x320dd56c: 0 messages\n"
[1,133,772,936,798] @"Total 1 boxes\n"
[1,133,772,936,802] 61^done
[1,133,772,936,803] (gdb)
=======snap==================

Now in order to use this command from eclipse and populate a new debug view from the output we created the usual CLICommand - MIInfo pair and posted the command via the MISession. Everything works fine except that the records containing the real information are not there. They are not collected in 

org.eclipse.cdt.debug.mi.core.RxThread.processMIOOBRecord(MIStreamRecord stream)

where the three possible output streams are processed. The current implementation is:

Console stream output: echo to console and collect as OOB record.
Log     stream output: echo to console and collect as OOB record.
Target  stream output: just echo to console.

The proposal is to add collecting as OOB record to the third alternative. This will make the output of any monitor commands that are present in a target, or that can be added by extending the gdb stub, available for automatic processing in the CDT debugging framework.
Alternate implementation suggestion from Mikhail Khodjaiants:

&gt; The alternative solution would be the addition of a special MI command for 
this. Is it doable?

I would rather have the enhancement along the lines I suggested above for the following reasons:

1) The proposal needs to extend the gdb stub only. The stub is made for adaptation and the adaptation procedure is described in the manual so we are assured that the gdb folk are aware of and will be supporting our approach.

2) The proposal makes existing "monitor" commands available for CDT debug views along with those which are newly created.

Just a simple question: do you need this for 3.0.2 or 3.1?
No special hurry, I can go by using a patched version of RxThread. I just want to be sure that it will not be forgotten on the long road to version 3.1. 

I understand that fixes for 3.1 go to HEAD and that there is a branch for 3.0.2 and I guess I am happiest if you do the fix now, although it's sufficient to do it in HEAD only.

Thanks a lot!

What if do it this way: I'll set the target milestone to 3.1 and you try the patched version and we'll see if there are some side effects. I didn't write this code and I'm not very comfortable changing it until I learn more.
Is this OK with you?
Fine, just let me know when you've applied the patches.
Hey Michail,

with my changed status I could now do the patch in case you don't find the time. Shall I?


Norbert
Norbert, 
Currently, I am making major changes in mi plugins and I don't want to commit it until I am done with it. Merging is a pain and takes a lot of time. Please, wait I'll let you know when it is save.
Thanks,
Mikhail
Supporting the GDB "monitor" command is an important feature for embedded development.

Seems to work fine on my rocket.

I'm using a BDI 2000 JTAG debugger and I took some simple "monitor" commands for a spin.


(gdb) monitor info
    Core number       : 0
    Core state        : debug mode (ARM)
    Debug entry cause : Breakpoint
    Current PC        : 0x0103fc00
    Current CPSR      : 0x20000013 (Supervisor)

Marking as fixed. Thanks, Norbert.
I had a question regarding this fix.  So when I type "monitor test" will whatever "monitor test" returns be displayed on eclipse console?  Or is this only to be passed to MIInfo?  If it is suppose to be displayed onto the eclipse console than I'm pretty sure the fix does not work.  I just wanted to sure as to what exactly it is suppose to do before going on.  Hope I didn't waste too much of everyone's time.

Mitchell,

the purpose of the fix was to get target stream output records into the MIInfo object which can be processed when the target responds to a (monitor) command. The fix does not intend to change the console behavior.
From taking a look at the code I think that the application output should appear in a console, though probably not in the gdb command line console. Alas, I do not have a live example handy and I am not very deeply familiar with the code.
Maybe you should post your question on the mailing list if you think there is something wrong with the behavior.
(In reply to comment #11)
Norbert, what is supposed to happen in this case? We don't use the "monitor" command and I don't have a test case. Didn't you submit it to solve a problem with your implementation? So, does it work for you or not?

&gt; command and I don't have a test case. Didn't you submit it to solve a problem
&gt; with your implementation? So, does it work for you or not?

I am populating a self-made view from the output of the monitor command. 
- The debug view registers for debug events. (DebugPlugin.addDebugEventListener()).
- When a suspend event is fired (DebugEvent.SUSPEND) a worker thread creates a monitor command object (derived from CLICommand) and posts it to the MISession (MISession.postCommand()).
- The thread then calls Command.getMIInfo() which makes it wait until the command is finished.
- RxThread collects all text which is returned as output in response to the command and puts it into an MIInfo object in the form of out-of-band records (MIOOBRecord). 
- This is where the bugfix comes in: Only after the fix is the target stream output stored in the MIInfo object and can be processed by the view's worker thread when it returns from MIInfo().

So in short:
- Yes, the fix solves a problem, namely to make target stream output available to debug event listeners and
- Yes, it works for me.

I did not need a console echo of the output and I do not remember (this is now about 6 months past) whether there was a console echo.
Alas, my debug view was not used much since then and I do not have a testing scenario handy to see what happens.
Sorry for the confusion. I was under the impression that the fix also enabled the monitor output to eclipse gdb console.  But anyways, the fix does what it is suppose to do.  Again, sorry for the confusion.

Sorry to awaken this thread again...

I am using the "monitor" commands to collect additional information from an embedded target. It is working OK, except that the response is appearing in the console, and I can't disable it.

In RxThread#processMIOOBRecord, for objects of class MIConsoleStreamOutput and MILogStreamOutput, isEnableConsole() is checked before writing to the console, but for MITargetStreamOutput it is not and so the output is alwsys written.

I can't (and don't want to) change GDB. Any suggestions?

    <WithStack>Hi. I renamed my workspace directory, re-launched eclipse, pointed it to my new workspace directory and all the tasks (well, bugzilla queries) were gone, even though the untouched .mylar directory was still in the workspace root. 

And also, going to preferences -&gt; mylar -&gt; monitor, the "enable logging to" value is still unchecked which is good, but it even the greyed out value is set to the old directory.
Created attachment 31193
Screenshot of error

After creating a new bugzilla query, it sucessfully downloaded the bugs. I activated one and started to do work. After about 15 min, an error occured (see screenshot). It's still using the old absolute path.

FYI, I created a new file and typed "abstract class " to create a new class when the error occurred.
Thansk for diagnosing David, that will make it quicker to fix.
Btw David, you can manually edit the path of the context file for the resource.  Just double click the task to open the editor, click the Task Info tab, and expand the "Resources" section.  But until 0.4.5 it may just be easier for you to try to keep the .mylar directory in the old location if that's possible, and then move it again.
Hi David,

I tried renaming both my runtime and development workspaces and the tasks, queries, and contexts moved properly. The broken path issue was a problem with earlier versions of Mylar but it should be working now (I tried with 0.4.4). 

What version are you using?
I was using 0.4.4 too...hmmm...how did u rename ur workspace?
I'm using Windows XP and I just renamed the folder containing the workspace. 

How long have you been using Mylar? The problem could be that your tasks (and possibly queries?) were created using earlier versions of Mylar that had a problem with with moving due to error-prone path information in the data files.
I can vouch for the fact that David has been using Mylar for quite some time :)

Which means that the task list workspace moves need to take care of the old paths.  I'm guessing that I won't have trouble triggering this problem with my task list since I get to claim being the first Mylar user.

Wesley, if you're planning on looking into this let me know and I can attach my task list.  Otherwise I hope to get to it tomorrow.
Mik, I have one of your old task lists so I can try moving the workspace using it.
Hi guys.

Although I'm using 0.4.4 now, I'm quite sure that I was using an earlier version from the 0.4.x series when I created the workspace. Here's the thing though, after the trouble I was getting after i renamed the workspace, i closed eclipse, manually deleted the .mylar directory, relaunched eclipse and made sure that the Task Directory (in prefs-&gt;mylar-&gt;task list) was correct. Since then everything's been fine BUT, just to test it I closed eclipse, renamed the workspace and tried again and guess what - my bugzilla queries were gone. The Task Directory in the prefs was still pointing at the old directory. Although now that I think about it I problably should've tried changing it. But still, shouldn't have to if it's in the workspace. Maybe %workspace%/.mylar would be a better solution that the full path.

Good luck guys :)
oh sorry, i didn't actually tell uz the point, lol. The point is that because i deleted the old .mylar directory, the new one was made with 0.4.4 yet when I renamed I got the same problem again so i think the bug still persists in 0.4.4.
Thanks for the helpful additional comments David. I'll post when I find something out about what's going on.
I can now replicate this problem and it looks like it's exactly what David diagnosed. When you first start mylar in a new workspace, the data directory is set to the full path of the .mylar directory. So when you move the workspace it looks in the wrong place.

Mik, a simple way to fix this would be to have all clients get the data directory path from MylarPlugin. MylarPlugin would then return getDefaultStoreDirectory() unless the user has explicitly specified another location (stored in the preference store). Let me know if I should give this a try or if you have another plan.
Excellent, thanks for the very helpful diagnosis David!  

Wesley: that's exactly the right fix--i.e. getting at the source of the problem and not fixing in the clients.  Is there a path or file that the clients are using which we could simply make private in order to enforce use of that method?
&gt;Excellent, thanks for the very helpful diagnosis David!

Glad to help. Thanks for Mylar :)
I've localized the directory code, and for tomorrow's 0.4.5 release all should be consistent after a move (please reopen if you see any problems).  Also, if you hit "Restore Defaults" on the task list page (and make sure that the "copy" option is checked), the workspace location will be used, and if you move your workspace Mylar will continue using the workspace relative path so there is no longer a need to change that option unless you want your tasks and contexts stored outside the workspace.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Hi. I renamed my workspace directory, re-launched eclipse, pointed it to my new workspace directory and all the tasks (well, bugzilla queries) were gone, even though the untouched .mylar directory was still in the workspace root. 

And also, going to preferences -&gt; mylar -&gt; monitor, the "enable logging to" value is still unchecked which is good, but it even the greyed out value is set to the old directory.

Screenshot of error

After creating a new bugzilla query, it sucessfully downloaded the bugs. I activated one and started to do work. After about 15 min, an error occured (see screenshot). It's still using the old absolute path.

FYI, I created a new file and typed "abstract class " to create a new class when the error occurred.
Thansk for diagnosing David, that will make it quicker to fix.
Btw David, you can manually edit the path of the context file for the resource.  Just double click the task to open the editor, click the Task Info tab, and expand the "Resources" section.  But until 0.4.5 it may just be easier for you to try to keep the .mylar directory in the old location if that's possible, and then move it again.
Hi David,

I tried renaming both my runtime and development workspaces and the tasks, queries, and contexts moved properly. The broken path issue was a problem with earlier versions of Mylar but it should be working now (I tried with 0.4.4). 

What version are you using?
I was using 0.4.4 too...hmmm...how did u rename ur workspace?
I'm using Windows XP and I just renamed the folder containing the workspace. 

How long have you been using Mylar? The problem could be that your tasks (and possibly queries?) were created using earlier versions of Mylar that had a problem with with moving due to error-prone path information in the data files.
I can vouch for the fact that David has been using Mylar for quite some time :)

Which means that the task list workspace moves need to take care of the old paths.  I'm guessing that I won't have trouble triggering this problem with my task list since I get to claim being the first Mylar user.

Wesley, if you're planning on looking into this let me know and I can attach my task list.  Otherwise I hope to get to it tomorrow.
Mik, I have one of your old task lists so I can try moving the workspace using it.
Hi guys.

Although I'm using 0.4.4 now, I'm quite sure that I was using an earlier version from the 0.4.x series when I created the workspace. Here's the thing though, after the trouble I was getting after i renamed the workspace, i closed eclipse, manually deleted the .mylar directory, relaunched eclipse and made sure that the Task Directory (in prefs-&gt;mylar-&gt;task list) was correct. Since then everything's been fine BUT, just to test it I closed eclipse, renamed the workspace and tried again and guess what - my bugzilla queries were gone. The Task Directory in the prefs was still pointing at the old directory. Although now that I think about it I problably should've tried changing it. But still, shouldn't have to if it's in the workspace. Maybe %workspace%/.mylar would be a better solution that the full path.

Good luck guys :)

We need an Import rewrite context that also is sensitive to the context where an import is added and what types are already used.
Isn't this a dup of bug 82166?

    <WithStack>In the 2.0M2 build of the "RCP Report Designer" I was able to use fonts in my pdf reports. This no longer works with the 2.0M3 build of the "RCP Report Designer". I only get the default "Times New Roman" font.

I tried adding the iText.jar file to the plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.emitter.fo_1.0.1\lib directory. That didn't help.

The log files in C:\birt_m3\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer_1.0.1\birt\logs
are empty.

I start birt with the following birt.cmd file:
echo on
setlocal
cd %~dp0
start javaw -DFOP_CONFIG_FILE=C:\birt_m3\fop\fop.xml -cp startup.jar      org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main -application org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.rcp.DesignerApplication%*
endlocal

My fop.xml file looks like this:
&lt;!--&lt;!DOCTYPE configuration SYSTEM "config.dtd"&gt;--&gt;
&lt;!-- to developers: have a look at the config.dtd to 
     see how to structure your config entries --&gt;

&lt;/configuration&gt;
Till now one had to convert the font names to lower case in the fop.xml file. Now one has to use the same font name in the fop.xml file as one uses in the report.

For example one has to replace the following entry

    <WithStack>When using MyLar 4.4 on Eclipse 3.1.1 on WinXP Pro (2,4Ghz 1GB RAM) with a big workspace and starting a ant build outside of Eclipse. The workbench seems to get stuck in a build or refreshing workspace loop. CPU Usage goes up to 100% and Eclipse becomes totally unresponsive. This happens when refresh automatically is activated and the workspace is trying to refresh and when refresh automatically is deactivated and doing a manual build on the project that is being touched by the build file.

Details for the external build:
The build touches the source folder in the current Project and creates build artefacts in the root of the Project:
ProjectRoot
 |- sources
 |- build.classes (created by build)

When refresh automatically is on Eclipse becomes unresponsive (&gt; 5Min. than I broke off) and no error is displayed in the .log file.

When refresh automatically is off Eclipse locks up but becomes responsive after some amount of time (&gt; 1Min) The following error was recorded in the .log

Workaround: Deactivating Refresh automatically and deactivating the task when doing external build. (This is tediouse and makes using MyLar a no option IMO)

The following was commented on the newsgroup by Mik Kersten:
[...]
&gt;It sounds like this could result from a problem with the automatic update of &gt;change sets or interest being set on resources created by the external build.
[...]
Thanks for the details Stefan, that should be enough for me to reproduce.  This will be fixed for Friday's 0.4.5 release, and I'll make the automatic change set management optional (definitely agree that the current work-around is much too tedious).  But note that the Mylar version is 0.4.4, not 4.4, largely because there better not be any such problems in a version &gt; 1.0 ;)
Stefan I've put some fixes in place and can not replicate this anymore, but I could not replicate it reliably.  Could you please try the following dev build and see if you can still replicate this problem?

(In reply to comment #2)
Looks good. I've run two builds (one with refresh automatically and one without refresh automatically). Both ran through without interfering with eclipse. 
For my setting the problem is solved!

Expected result:
return report design name.

Actual result:
return "&lt;stream&gt;".
the reportName is alwasy the file name of report design. If the report design saved into the report document, the report design name is missing. Should we store the report design name into the report document?

Create a stream called designName and save the report design as UTFString in it.

GetPageNumber( InstanceID iid ) in ReportDocumentReader class isn't implemented.

Steps to reproduce:
1. View GetPageNumber( InstanceID iid ) method in ReportDocumentReader class

Result:
It just returns 0.
It seems that no one will use this API in RC, so can we move it to BIRT 2.1?
Moved to future release as the function is not needed in BIRT 2.0.
is this method on a public API? if yes, I think we shall either remove it or implement it.   We are supposed API freeze at M5.
decide on the API.
package org.eclipse.report.birt.engine.api.impl is a private package, so ReportDocumentReader is not a public API. Whether it will be implemented is an internal decision.
OK.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hi,

I am trying to compile few dynamically generated aspects programatically. In the program i will contruct a classpath with aspectjrt.jar and aspecttools.jar and other third party jars, which my program depends on. And i compile the dynamically generated aspects as follows,

java -Xmx512m -classpath (followed by all the jars that i have constructed) org.aspectj.tools.ajc.Main E:\MyProject\com\test\aspect\myaspect\hdyb\*.java

When executed as above, it gives the following error,

    <WithStack>StyledText has new API that allows to separate the styles from the ranges (see StyleRange). This allows to reduce the memory consumption compared to using just StyleRange-s.

In order to support this we will have to introduce new API in Platform Text and change all clients in Platform Text and JDT Text plus inform other clients. Platform Text will have to convert old API calls and merge the result with the usages of the new API calls before calling StyledText API.

This includes a major rewrite of TextPresentation.

NOTE: StyledText is converting to the new structure when the old APIs are called.
3.2 time permitting.
Has to be shifted to 3.3.
This reaches deep into the APIs and is too late at this point for 3.3.

Extended version of TextPresentation

In an earlier project of mine (a PL/I editor) I discovered how important the new StyledText API is.  When I tried to process huge source files (nearing 1 megabyte) it brought Eclipse to its knees.  But when I used the new StyledText interface directly in the presentation repairer (instead of the normal processing), it was reasonably usable.  The performance difference was night and day!  One problem, of course, was that text annotations were not merged properly.

In a current project, I'm using an extended projection viewer.  While I was at it, I decided to extend TextPresentation as well so that it uses the new StyledText API while still allowing in-text annotations to be merged.  

I am attaching the source for my extended TextPresentation in its current state, and have included some commentary to explain the changes.

It adds API, but as far as I can tell none of the old API is broken.

It seems to be working, although more debugging is certainly needed.  I have no idea if this will be of use to you directly, but feel free.  If anyone is working on this problem perhaps it will make interesting reading.  At least it demonstrates that the problem can be solved, although production code might not do it the same way I did.

Please let me know if I can help further.  Would you like this in the form of a patch file?

Bill Fenlason
Hi Bill,
which version of Eclipse do you use? SWT internally changed their code to reduce the memory so that the new API is not always needed.

Could you attach your code together with a test case that shows the memory benefits?
Dani,

The preliminary code in the attachment I posted was based on the 3.6 TextPresentation.    

Do you know which version of StyledText contains the changes you mentioned?  I will want to check that out.  I didn't notice changes in 3.6, but I haven't looked closely yet.      

The memory savings are external to the StyledText widget and relate to the ability to share and reuse StyleRange objects. (StyleRange extends TextStyle) 

Currently when a presentation is generated, StyleRange objects can not be shared and a different (new) StyleRange object is needed for each token in the presentation.  For large source files that can be a big number, since typically the average token length is 5 or less.  

If the StyleRange objects are shared by providing the offset and length separately as int arguments (to the TextPresentation addStyleRange method, etc.), only a small (fixed) number of model StyleRange objects are needed.  

The StyledText API allows shared StyleRanges but currently the TextPresentation does not.  The StyledText API doesn't help much because it isn't used.

(Undoubtedly you know all that, but other readers might not be as aware of the situation.)  

Unfortunately I'm unable to generate a test case to quantify the memory savings and performance difference right now.
&gt;Do you know which version of StyledText contains the changes you mentioned?
Since 3.2. As you can see from the implementation, the old methods call the new ones that try to optimize the memory.

So far we simply didn't start to add the new APIs to TextPresentation because our use for that class is in the text viewer and hence we only benefit if we also rewrite all the related code.

If only adding the new APIs to TextPresentation helps you then we can do that but as previously said, we need a regular patch and test cases for the new APIs.
Yes, corresponding changes to the TextViewer are necessary if the text viewer is to use the more efficient API.  

My project extends TextViewer.  The changes are straight forward but I'm still testing them.  I'll append the TextViewer changes in the near future.  

In the attached version of TextPresentation, the applyTextPresentation() method is modified to demonstrate the use of the new API.  The TextViewer changes are similar.

Certainly the bulk of the use will be through the TextViewer, but note that other callers, such as the HTMLTextPresenter or 3rd party code can still use the old TextPresentation API.  Naturally, it is essential that the old API keep working while the text viewer gets the benefit of the 3.3 StyledText API.

When I've finished testing I'll generate patches.  It's early to discuss test cases, but I assume the sample XML plugin editor may be a reasonable start.
&gt;but I assume the sample XML plugin editor may be a reasonable start.
You can use that to test the initial implementation on your side but I'd expect to see additional tests in org.eclipse.jface.text.tests.TextPresentationTest and also memory usage comparisons e.g. when typing in the Java or Text editor.

    <WithStack>If you launch for instance a build and it's implemented in a recursive way, make
will start several subprocesses. Cancelling the build does kill only the root
make-process, its childs run till normal termination.

Proposed Fix:

The spawner creates a new program group by calling
setpgid(getpgid(), getpgid())
after the fork (has to be done before any exec.. call)
the call to kill is replaced by killpg to destroy the whole process group.

This fix should work for most probably all unix systems.
Created attachment 31190
Proposed patch 

Patch for linux, should work for all unix implementations.
Tested on RHEL 4.
Cool thanks, I'll take a look.
Could this fix be added to the 3.0.2 Release?
We've passed RC0 and I'm afraid rebuilding the native libraries will destablize 3.0.2, not to mention take a long time since we need co-operation of the community to make this happen. I'll mark this for 3.1 to make sure it gets done.

Test makefiles for reproducing problem

This zip contains 2 makefiles. Extract them to a directory and start make there.
The first makefile will launch make in the subdir and this will launch sleep, so that there are 3 processes running (2x make and sleep). If the process is launched using the command launcher you can kill it using the destroy() method. In the original implementation only the root make process will be killed, with the patch applied all 3 processes should be killed.
Applied the patch, the binaries are yet to be updated.
This is fixed for Windows, all Linux but PPC and Solaris.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When using a fixed width console, any lines which contain a tab are shown as longer than the fixed width.

Specifically, it appears that the formatting algorithm fixes the console width to a number of bytes, not characters. This is particularly evident with stack traces which begin with a tab. Because the tab renders as 8 spaces (in my config), each tab character on any given line causes that line to exceed the defined width by 7 characters.
For this to work properly, I think we'd need to translate (or at least simulate) the tab chars to be real spaces. This would be required to make character ranges match up with document ranges. For example, if a document consists of a tab, the doc length is currently 1. However, it is rendered as 8 by SWT (or whatever the tab size is).

Daniel, does jface do anything here, or are there any existing requests against jface to handle tabs in documents differently?
&gt;Daniel, does jface do anything here, or are there any existing requests against
&gt;jface to handle tabs in documents differently?
What should it "do"? What do you mean by "handle tabs differently"?
If a tab character is mapped to 8 characters for presentation purposes, does (or should) the document consider the tab to be 1 character or 8?
1. 8 is just the display tab width.
Not planned for 3.2
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hi,

I'm not sure if this is really a bug (maybe it's by design), but it is first irritating, then annoying. 

Problem is that when quickfix removes an unused param from a method it does not fix invocations of that method ("Refactor-&gt;Change method signature" fixes it correctly).

Example:

package removeunused;

public class RemoveUnusedParamBug {

	// set "Unnecessary code-&gt;Parameter is never read" 
	// to "Warning". Now select the second parameter below
	// and do quickfix "Remove declaration..."
	// (does not work)
	// then undo and try again with Alt+Shift+C (works)
	
	public RemoveUnusedParamBug (int i, int j) {
		System.out.println(i);
	}
	
	// same here
	public void sameHere(int i, int j) {
		System.out.println(i);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new RemoveUnusedParamBug(47, 11).sameHere(8, 15);
	}
}

Proposed fix: change the quickfix's result to be the same as the result of "Change method signature".

Michael
Quick fix isn't refactoring, so it doesn't try do expensive operation like searching all references ect.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I've just come across a problem that sounds like it may be related to the recent discussion about spaces in filenames. Its occured with a non-Cygwin Windows toolchain (MinGW gcc 3.4), however my filenames don't have spaces. I'm currently playing with CDT HEAD, and am trying to compile a project which lives under path:

    C:\eclipseWork\workspaces\runtime-workspace\baddeps\src\hello.c

 

The managed make system is generating make files containing rules of the form

 

    # Each subdirectory must supply rules for building sources it contributes
    src/%.o: ../src/%.c
     @echo 'Building file: $&lt;'
     @echo 'Invoking: GCC C Compiler'
     @echo gcc -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o'$@' '$&lt;'
     @gcc -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o'$@' '$&lt;' &amp;&amp; \
     echo -n '$(@:%.o=%.d)' $(dir $@) &gt; '$(@:%.o=%.d)' &amp;&amp; \
     gcc -MM -MG -P -w -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0  '$&lt;' &gt;&gt; '$(@:%.o=%.d)'
     @echo 'Finished building: $&lt;'
     @echo ' '

 

(note that the input macro $&lt; is now enclosed in single quotes). Upon running this gives output:


    **** Full rebuild of configuration Debug for project baddeps ****

    

    make -k clean all 
    rm -rf  ./src/hello.o  ./src//hello.d  baddeps.exe
    ' '
    'Building file: ../src/hello.c'
    'Invoking: GCC C Compiler'
    gcc -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o'src/hello.o' '../src/hello.c'
    gcc: '../src/hello.c': No such file or directory
    gcc: no input files
    make: *** [src/hello.o] Error 1
    make: Target `all' not remade because of errors.
    Build complete for project baddeps

 

because the underlying shell is Windows XP CMD.exe, which (from experiments) treats single quotes the same as any alphanumeric character. Running the same gcc command from the shell, without single quotes, compiles as expected.

I've tracked this down to the code below from org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.internal.core.ManagedCommandLineGenerator (originating in rev 1.3)

    // if the input resource isn't a variable then quote it

    if(inputResources[k].indexOf("$(") != 0) //$NON-NLS-1$
         tempBuffer.append(SINGLE_QUOTE + inputResources[k] + SINGLE_QUOTE + WHITESPACE); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$
        else
         tempBuffer.append(inputResources[k] + WHITESPACE);
this defect is related to a subject discussed on the cdt-dev mailing list originated by Chris R. which discusses supporting spaces in filenames (subject line "The Shell Game")

adding single quotes around file names which would allow tools invoked from a unix shell to receive filenames containing spaces seems to confuse windows CMD.exe


I'll change the single quotes to double quotes.  That should appease both bash and cmd.exe
Can you confirm which version of CDT this was on?  I see you've put 3.0.1 but as I recall the spaces support which added the single quotes was only done on HEAD.
sorry - my bad

I've been developing from HEAD but wrongly assumed it had got into 3.0.1

I have committed a change to 3.1 (head) to use double quotes rather than single quotes.</WithStack>
