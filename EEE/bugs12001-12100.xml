    <WithStack>Revisit startup methods. Make anything lazy that can be.
LaunchManager
- Made launch configuration type initialization lazy.
- Made source location initialization lazy.
Largely refactored the DebugUIPlugin. Pulled launch configuration management 
code out into its own class and made launch config data retrieval as lazy as 
possible.
DebugPlugin
- Made status handler initialization lazy
Please verify changes to Debug and DebugUI plugins.

I didn't find any improvements to the JDI debug plugins. They're just 
registering listeners and newing up objects - light work.
Please verify.

    <WithStack>Hi Guys,

We am using Linux-motif Eclipse 2.0 build 20020214 using, as OS Linux redHat 
7.2 updated to Kernel 2.4.18 and KDE 2.2.2.

We have been develloping our Java programs using IBM Jdk 1.3.1 for months. 

When we have tried to switch to Sun JDK 1.4.0. 

Eclipse always catchs an exception and exit, in load time.

In the following i'm reporting to you the log file generated.

      2 An unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the 
VM.
      3 Unexpected Signal : 11 occurred at PC=0x0
      4 Function=[Unknown.]
      5 Library=(N/A)
      6
      7 NOTE: We are unable to locate the function name symbol for the error
      8       just occurred. Please refer to release documentation for 
possible
      9       reason and solutions.

GG to write a faq entry describing what's going on.
Hi

i had a similar Problem under Windows NT after installing SUN's JDK 1.4. I 
fixed it by creating a directory jre in the eclipse installation directory and 
placing a JRE 1.3 in this directory. This JRE will then be used to run eclipse, 
but you still can have a different JRE in your PATH.
Wrote a FAQ entry and sent it to McQ for inclusion in either the SWT FAQ or 
Eclipse FAQ.  Now marking this report as a duplicate of bug 9211 since the 
original problem still exists.

    <WithOutStack>Hi Guys,

We am using Linux-motif Eclipse 2.0 build 20020214 using, as OS Linux redHat 
7.2 updated to Kernel 2.4.18 and KDE 2.2.2.

We have been develloping our Java programs using IBM Jdk 1.3.1 for months. 

When we have tried to switch to Sun JDK 1.4.0. 

Eclipse always catchs an exception and exit, in load time.

In the following i'm reporting to you the log file generated.

      2 An unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the 
VM.
      3 Unexpected Signal : 11 occurred at PC=0x0
      4 Function=[Unknown.]
      5 Library=(N/A)
      6
      7 NOTE: We are unable to locate the function name symbol for the error
      8       just occurred. Please refer to release documentation for 
possible
      9       reason and solutions.

GG to write a faq entry describing what's going on.
Hi

i had a similar Problem under Windows NT after installing SUN's JDK 1.4. I 
fixed it by creating a directory jre in the eclipse installation directory and 
placing a JRE 1.3 in this directory. This JRE will then be used to run eclipse, 
but you still can have a different JRE in your PATH.
Wrote a FAQ entry and sent it to McQ for inclusion in either the SWT FAQ or 
Eclipse FAQ.  Now marking this report as a duplicate of bug 9211 since the 
original problem still exists.

    <WithStack>Hello,
I would suggest a little improvement to the formating capability.
The formater could eliminate blank lines ,except maybe one , between methods 
description. If there is no blank line betwwen two methods, the formater could 
also add one automatically.
It could beautify the whole file contents.
regards
Xavier

Examples :

	/**
	 * Constructor for PropertyParameterEntity.
	 */
	public PropertyParameterEntity() {
		super();
	}
//blank
//blank
//blank
//blank
	/**
	 * Constructor for PropertyParameterEntity.
	 * @param aName
	 */
	public PropertyParameterEntity(String aName) {
         ...
would become
	/**
	 * Constructor for PropertyParameterEntity.
	 */
	public PropertyParameterEntity() {
		super();
	}
//blank
	/**
	 * Constructor for PropertyParameterEntity.
	 * @param aName
	 */
	public PropertyParameterEntity(String aName) {
        /...
Sorry..I've checked on an old version.. It runs on the last one..

Sorry again...
There is still a case where it is not running ;
Example :
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity() {
		super();
	}// NO BLANK LINE BETWEEN METHODS OR ATTRIBUTES
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity(String unNom) {
		super();
		name = unNom;
	}
should give :
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity() {
		super();
	}
//Blank line
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity(String unNom) {
		super();
		name = unNom;
	}
Formatter only reduces blank lines, it does not insert some in between methods.
Will consider post 2.0
Resurrecting formatter issues in 2.1 stream.
Clearing resolution

There is still a case where it is not running ;
Example :
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity() {
		super();
	}// NO BLANK LINE BETWEEN METHODS OR ATTRIBUTES
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity(String unNom) {
		super();
		name = unNom;
	}
should give :
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity() {
		super();
	}
//Blank line
	/**
	 * OperationEntity constructor comment.
	 */
	public OperationEntity(String unNom) {
		super();
		name = unNom;
	}
Formatter only reduces blank lines, it does not insert some in between methods.
Will consider post 2.0
Resurrecting formatter issues in 2.1 stream.

    <WithStack>hello,
A very small bug but annoying trotzdem.
Context : Java browsing perspective, with single method displaying option
Eclipse version : the 20020314
Procedure : I want to use the Add java doc comment menu option on a method 
without any comment, but which redefines a method in a super-class
Result : I obtain the following result 
=&gt;	/*
	 * @see LogicalEntity#printOn(IDelphiWriter)
	 */
	public void printOn(IDelphiWriter aWriter) {
		aWriter.printClass(this);
	}
instead of
=&gt;	/** 
	 * @see LogicalEntity#printOn(IDelphiWriter)
	 */
	public void printOn(IDelphiWriter aWriter) {
		aWriter.printClass(this);
	}
It is a little thing, but it causes the editor not to recognize the comment.
Regards
Xavier

    <WithStack>pressing ctrl+j in pde .xml editor does not activate incremental find
incremental search should be pushed down from Java so that it works in all text

It is already at the right place. It's up to PDE to use the 
BasicTextEditorActionContributor for their PDESourcePage editor.
Other useful actions like Goto Line are missing, too.
PDE cannot directly subclass BasicTextEditorActionContributor because PDE is a 
multi-page contributor and those menus only affect source page. However, I PDE 
contributor can create an instance of the text contributor and manage page 
switching when source page is shown/hidden.

Implemented and tested - incremental find and goto line seem to work now.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Feedback from an Eclipse user:

* "Save File" in Catch-up or Release mode -- this is a serious problem, 
which you may already know about.  If you are in a catch-up browser and you 
take some changes from the right window, now the left window has changes, 
which will need to be saved if they are to be kept.  So far, so 
good.  However, if you click outside of this pane, say, for example, you go 
to the Java perspective - the tool doesn't first prompt you to save the 
file you just modified.  So you could think you just got the latest code, 
when you didn't, because you didn't save it.   This has left several 
students scratching their heads, wondering if the tool wasn't working, 
when, in fact, it was their error.  So I think the tool needs to be better 
about this: if you have a modified file in the catch-up window, and you 
click *anywhere* outside of that window, it should prompt you to save your 
changes.
We definitely need to do a better job here.  We provide no feedback to tell you 
its modified.  The idea of saving if you lose focus is interesting --- I don't 
know of anyone else in Eclipse who does it though so concerned about 
consistency.

We do have at least one other existing PR on this subject but I will leave this 
one in for the save-on-lose-focus idea.
Consider Sync as a perspective so editors can be "real".
Interim for 2.0 - offer to save on loss of focus.
Cannot do a perfect job of fixing this until Bug#14378 is fixed
since there is no precise way of determining when the contents
of the underlying CompareEditorInput in the SyncView are dirty.

We can still implement saving on loss of focus in the meantime
(using a workaround), but we may prompt the user unnecessarily
under certain circumstances.

Fixed for change of focus form the sync view. Once above mentioned bug is fixed
in compare the prompting will be correct (e.g. won't prompt multiple times).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If you define a Working set, say as everything in project foo.  If you then 
delete project foo the working set still remains.  It seems to me that once all 
the resources that a Working Set points to are removed the working set itself 
should be.  Trying opeations (searches for example) scoped to that working set 
however doesn't throw an error or cause anything else bad to happen, it just 
returns no results.  So this bug is mostly a cosmetic thing.

Build 20020214
Moving to JDT-UI as they define working sets.
working set support is now pushed down into the platform - moving.
This would improve the "fit and finish"
I'm not convinced that empty working sets should be deleted if they get empty 
because a referenced project is deleted from the workspace.

We currently automatically remove deleted resources from working sets that 
contain it, which is what you are seeing. Bug 15086 was opened to remove this 
feature and keep deleted resources in working sets without displaying them. The 
idea is that a working set should not change unless the user modifies it. If a 
deleted project is added back later it would automatically show up in the 
working sets it used to be in.
The other concern is that working sets may be changed programmatically. There 
could theoretically be an operation that deletes all resources contained in a 
working set and that then adds back (other) resources. It would be unexpected 
behavior if we automatically delete the empty working set.

Since we plan to fix bug 15086 this bug is invalid. Working sets will never be 
empty unless the resources are explicitly removed from the working set.</WithStack>

I did a synch with repository this morning and it showed 7 conflicts (for
.project files, which may be another bug), 52 incoming changes, and 159 outgoing
changes. I selected the projects and chose "Update from repository." After
working on it for a few minutes, an internal error dialog appeared - "An
internal error has occured". The dialog gave no more information, but I found
the following in my log:

It turns out that the repository I was connected to died while I was
synchronizing (someone literally pulled the plug by accident).

Once the repository came back online, I was able to synch with it again and
finish updating.
I looked at our code and the exception is thrown if the session is closed 
twice. I can't see how this could happen based on the code path but it 
obviously did. We should either throw a more informative exception or just log 
the problem.
This was fixed a while ago</WithStack>

    <WithStack>is it possible to show the Threads of the Debug-view in
a more detailed tree, i.e.: first level the debugged or 
running VMs, all other inner nodes are Threadgroups and
the the leafes are the Threads.

Perhaps so much details need more communication with the debugged 
VM, and therefor this tree should become only displayed if the
eclipse user wants it.
A more elaborated implementation of this feature may 
make the debugger faster (I say that because in my 
initial posting I suggest that it makes the debug-view slower):
I have programms with many threads (a few hundret) and that makes
the debugger sometimes slow. But programms with so many Thread may
group them. And If the debug view only updates the open 
Threadgroup nodes it is possible that the debug view becomes faster.
Because less updates are needed.
Thread groups are not part of the debug model currently. There are different 
possibilities for showing this info (such as showing the thread group in the 
label).

Deferred (not in 2.0 plan)
*** Bug 1560 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I can understand that you don't want to implement that feature 
for now. But I can't understand your explanation:
    "Thread groups are not part of the debug model currently."
Which debugging model: Eclipse or Java-VM ? 
I don't think that this enhancement of the debug view has much to do with a
debug modell, it is more like the sort option of an table-view, i.e. it is 
possible to sort the rows in the table view without any knowledge 
of the viewed table. 
In the same way it is possible to group the Threads in the debug view by
arbitrary criterion: For example group all Threads with names that match a 
configurable String-pattern: *TG:[$Threadgroup$]*.
With this functionality the debugview can group the Threads, if I add the 
threadgroups name to the Thread label: ...TG[Ftp-server]...,
...TG[Http-server]..., ...TG[User_1].... (that is what you suggested). 
And this method is extendable, if it becomes possible to query the 
debugged VM for the Threadgroup of a Thread the grouping criterion is
very simple to implement. The method with the configurable String-pattern 
is perhaps usefull for other programming languages too.


Thread groups are not part of the "language independent debug model" that 
eclipse provides. It just means we cannot do a generic solution for all 
languagues. It does not preclude grouping threads.
*** Bug 117878 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
With the new "flexible debug platform" support this feature should be possible now. I.e. we're no longer tied to the strict element hierarchy in the platform debug model.
In which case, can I please request that this bug is re-opened?
re-opening for 3.2. It's a good use case/test for the "flexible" support in the debug platform.
Created attachment 32092
Example patch for thread groups

Attaching patch as example on how to use new flex hierarchy support. This is a work in progress, not the final intended presentation.
CC Mikhail for example use of flexible hierarchy/model proxy.
Fixed. Thread groups are displayed in debug tree now.

Added IJavaThreadGroup to java debug model, along with methods on IJavaDebugTarget to get all thread groups/root groups and IJavaThread to get its thread group.

Added content/label adapters for new model element, and toggle action to determine whether groups are displayed. By default, toggle is off.
Please verify, Kevin.
Found a bug in current implementation... Appears to be Mac specific.
1. launch VectorTest to breakpoint
2. turn on thread groups (main thread group does not get expanded automatically)
3. turn off thread groups -&gt; boom!

In the same way it is possible to group the Threads in the debug view by
arbitrary criterion: For example group all Threads with names that match a 
configurable String-pattern: *TG:[$Threadgroup$]*.
With this functionality the debugview can group the Threads, if I add the 
threadgroups name to the Thread label: ...TG[Ftp-server]...,
...TG[Http-server]..., ...TG[User_1].... (that is what you suggested). 
And this method is extendable, if it becomes possible to query the 
debugged VM for the Threadgroup of a Thread the grouping criterion is
very simple to implement. The method with the configurable String-pattern 
is perhaps usefull for other programming languages too.


Thread groups are not part of the "language independent debug model" that 
eclipse provides. It just means we cannot do a generic solution for all 
languagues. It does not preclude grouping threads.
*** Bug 117878 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
With the new "flexible debug platform" support this feature should be possible now. I.e. we're no longer tied to the strict element hierarchy in the platform debug model.
In which case, can I please request that this bug is re-opened?
re-opening for 3.2. It's a good use case/test for the "flexible" support in the debug platform.
Created attachment 32092
Example patch for thread groups

Attaching patch as example on how to use new flex hierarchy support. This is a work in progress, not the final intended presentation.
CC Mikhail for example use of flexible hierarchy/model proxy.
Fixed. Thread groups are displayed in debug tree now.

Added IJavaThreadGroup to java debug model, along with methods on IJavaDebugTarget to get all thread groups/root groups and IJavaThread to get its thread group.

Added content/label adapters for new model element, and toggle action to determine whether groups are displayed. By default, toggle is off.
Please verify, Kevin.
Found a bug in current implementation... Appears to be Mac specific.
1. launch VectorTest to breakpoint
2. turn on thread groups (main thread group does not get expanded automatically)
3. turn off thread groups -&gt; boom!

Lot of these NPE's:

	... 20 more
NPE's are gone on I20060131-1200. Probably an swt fix.

    <WithStack>When trying to close the hierarchy view, I always expect to find the "X" in the 
far upper right hand corner.  I never do.  Seems that most views put the X 
there.  Also, when using fast-views a similar thing happens to the packages 
view and (I think) to any view with a toolbar.  However, that may be by design, 
and since it is a "special case" is far less disconcerting.  

-Andrew
The position of the close box is controller by Platform UI - moving
Yes. This needs to be fixed. 

After playing around with this some in the March 21st build, it seems this is 
caused _for all views_ when the toolbar at the top of the view does not have 
enough horizontal screen real estate for all the toolbar buttons, of which 
the "X" (close) is one.  When this happens, the toolbar splits into a multi-
line toolbar.  Not sure what this means for fixing this, but it would be nice 
if that "X" was always in the upper-right-most corner.

    <WithStack>Build 20020214

When I'm exploring a new framework, or somebody else's code, I often find 
myself curious about when a class is instantiated.  To find this out, I need to 
set a breakpoint in every constructor of the class.

This can be a problem if:

- the class has many constructors, or
- the class has no constructors (only the default one)

It would be nice if I could add a method breakpoint for &lt;init&gt; (with any 
signature) to catch all of these with one breakpoint.
deferred
Closing, not intending to implement.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In an eclipse environment, under the plugins directory add a new directory 
(sibling to org.apache.xerces).  I called the directory AADebTest.  Under 
AADebTest, add a new plugin.xml.  Startup eclipse.  The RegistryCacheReader 
asks BootLoader.getCurrentPlatformConfiguration().getPluginsChangeStamp() if 
there are any changes in the plugins.  No changes are detected and so the cache 
is read and the new plugin is not picked up.

This in build 20020319.  This exact case did work previously.
I cannot recreate the reported problem. In fact in testing, have observer the 
exact opposite problem ... registry being reloaded even when the computed stamp 
has not changed (see note at the end). 

I have done the following (on Win2K, see runtime trace output as attachment):
* start with band new 20030319, and new workspace (default location)
* started Eclipse, shutdown
* create AADebTest with empty plugin.xml
* started Eclipse (change is recognized), shutdown
* restarted (without change, same stamp computed) - but registry is reloaded !!!
* shutdown
* modified plugin.xml, launch
* new stamp computed, registry reloaded, shotdown
* restart (without change), come up using cache

What I noticed while playing with this is that if I have a plugin.xml file that 
does not have a complete &lt;plugin&gt; tag, the registry is always reloaded whether I 
made a change or not. I tried this with empty plugin.xml, &lt;plugin name="foo"/&gt;, 
&lt;plugin name="foo" id="test.foo"/&gt;. It wasn't until I got a plugin tag with both 
id and version that things worked the way I expected.

So if you are still experiencing the original problem, please provide exact 
steps to reproduce.

Tried reproducing this the same way you did and got the same results you did 
(i.e. it worked).  Here's what I did:
- create a new environment (20020319)and workspace
- start Eclipse
- do the Import-&gt;External Plugins and Fragments-&gt;Choose from the plugins in the 
runtime platform-&gt;Select All
- from our repostitory, pull in the core projects I'm interested in 
(answering 'Yes to All' when asked if these projects should replace existing 
ones) -- NOTE:  I don't think this step is relevant
- now in this plugins directory (where my 'imported' plugins and repostitory 
stuff is) add the AADebTest directory and plugin.xml
- fire up Eclipse within Eclipse - uses the plugins directory with AADebTest 
but doesn't find AADebTest

Am I cheating?  No wrist slapping please.
OK, I see what is happening here ... this is a self-hosting scenario ...

The problem is that when you launch Eclipse within Eclipse, PDE is calculating a 
precise plugin-path based on what is in the workspace (ie. actuall projects 
as resources known by the workspace, not just directories in the file system). 
This is needed because PDE is in control in terms of deciding what should be 
launched. When you create the directory, the workspace does not know about it, 
and consequently the new directory is not included on the plugin path. Had you 
created a new plugin project called AADebTest and then launched, the new 
directory would have been picked up (directory created as a result of the 
"create project" action). This would have resulted in a new change stamp. Also, 
if you then edited the plugin.xml and launched, this would have also resulted in 
a new change stamp (plugin.xml is the only containing file that will do this).</WithStack>

Why are we deleting launch configurations when the history gets too large.
Is this old code.  In DebugUIPlugin#updateNewHistories its talks about 
autosaved configurations being removed...does this concept still exist?
Joe and I think that the offending code (the code doing the deletion in 
DebugUIPlugin#updateNewHistories) should be removed.
Fixed for M4 and in head in DebugUIPlugin#updateNewHistory(String, Vector,

    <WithStack>IWorkbenchPage contains two API methods for closing editors:
closeEditor(IEditorPart, boolean) and closeAllEditors(boolean).

As part of the EditorView I'm making (Bug 10941), I'm allowing users to
multi-select open editors and choose "Close." With the current API, I have to
call closeEditor() repeatedly, which results in poor performance. I would like a
method IWorkbenchPage#closeEditors(IEditorPart[], boolean) to close multiple
editors.
If you require this change for the 2.0 release of eclipse please reopen this 
defect. 
Reopen to investigate
There is an API method for closing an array of editors and optionally prompt 
to save dirty editors now.  

IWorkbenchPage.closeAllEditors(boolean save)

we disable that?
You could always place the breakpoints...just before even the valid ones would 
never get hit as they were not installed.

There is no easy way currently to tell we are in an interface...our 
BreakpointLocationVerify would need to be beefed up quite a bit.  Similar for 
the type declaration line (which is allowed for both class and interface).


OK, as long as it is not a regression.

&lt;item&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join a CVS team&lt;/b&gt;
To join a CVS development team, open the &lt;action
pluginId="org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui" 
class="org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.actions.ShowCVSPerspectiveAction"&gt;CVS
Perspective&lt;/action&gt;. Next, specify the location
of your CVS repository. To do this choose &lt;action
pluginId="org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui" 
class="org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.actions.NewCVSRepositoryAction"&gt;New &gt;
CVS Repository Location...&lt;/action&gt; from the
Repositories view popup menu. When the location wizard opens, fill in the
details of your 
CVS repository and click Finish. 
*** Bug 12799 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Randy, could you please take care of updating the welcome text?
Should make the welcome page resilient to broken links too.
Added check in WelcomeItem

welcome.xml is owned by releng.
Moving to them to make the changes

    <WithStack>I've been using Eclipse since 1.0 and I've had pretty constant startup 
problems.  Often the Eclipse splash screen stays up even though the javaw.exe 
process has died.

I think Eclipse should bring up a SWT based splash screen with progress and 
error reporting as soon as possible.  The current system leaves you wondering 
if Eclipse is *ever* going to start up.
Not planned for 2.0
Reopening
Startup has improved considerably since this bug report was written. Now the 
splash screen comes up at the beginning and stays up (almost) until your 
workspace is started.

Please enter another bug report with your system configuration if you are 
still experiencing startup problems with the latest builds.</WithStack>

Looks like Eclipse is having a problem with CVS.

How do I work around this?

Why doesn't Eclipse bring up the UI before dealing with these issues?  I'd 
prefer to see a progress panel with a cancel button and some hint as to what's 
gone wrong.
What's extra vexxing is that none of my open projects uses CVS.

My non-open CVS projects reference CVS servers at sourceforge.net ... they're a 
bit low on the reliability front.  It could be that Eclipse was calling out to 
a CVS server that wasn't there ... but why?

Again, whatever its doing should be scheduled after the GUI comes up, so that 
we can get some visual feedback of what its doing.
I believe it would've come up eventually, its no hung, just doing more work 
than it should.

CVS decorators are not contacting the server.  However, they are doing more 
work in that build then they should be.  Its not clear though that this is the 
slow down - we just happened to get caught at the top of the stack trace.  
Nonethelss you should take either 0319 or the milestone build that'll be out 
tomorrow or Friday, since there have been considerable CVS decorator 
improvements.

We may be doing more decorator work on closed projects than we should be.
Entering http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12041, adding reporter to 
CC.

The point is valid that the UI should become alive first before decorators or 
other work occurs.  However, the CVS decorators are actually computed in a 
background thread, then we notify the UI that they are ready, so we are trying 
to be good citizens here.   This is the CVS decorator thread you saw.

Also:
- JDT is doing a lot of work on startup and I believe in the UI thread.  Can it 
build the hierarchy (or whatever its doing) in a background thread?

nothing is echoed out.

    <WithStack>I performed the following scenario:
1. Turn pruning on
2. checkout a project
3. turn pruning off
4. branch on the project and create a directory with a file
5. merge the branch into head
The directory shows up as an outgoing deletion because the directory is in the 
base and remote but not the local. The file is an incoming addition. Choosing 
update from the merge editor results in an error because the incoming file 
creation does not have a local parent directory. The problem is that the folder 
appears in the base and remote but not in the local (since it was pruned) so it 
is interpreted as an outgoing deletion. We need to change the sync kind 
determination for folders.
Anther problem with folders involves folders created in both a branch and HEAD. 
In the merge, they show up as pseudo conflicts and are not show in the merge 
editor unless the global preference to show pseudo conflicts is enabled.

The scenario to reproduce is:
1. Create a folder in a branch and add a file to the folder
2. create the same folder in head and add a different file to it
3. Merge the branch with Head

it should be able to just use this working copy - otherwise i have no way to 
present error context correctly
Fixed the part that the error wizard page now uses the working copy passed in 
the source context. It doesn't use the original element anymore.

Moving to AK, since the source context contains the wrong working copy
working copy was actually the correct one - but it was destroyed.
fixed by added a new context class that takes just strings</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I'm using 20020214 with Team 2.0 enabled.  Eclipse should hide the existence of 
the CVS folders from the Reposistory and Navigator views.
There are filters available in 0319 (and earlier).

There is new support from Core that just came in this milestone that will allow 
us to hide them for real.  This work will occur for us in M5.

I'm sure there's an existing PR for it but can't find it.
Fixed in build &gt; 20020401

CVS folders are automatically hidden from plugins that ignore team-private
resources. The package and navigator filters have been removed. This also works
for refreshing from local. If new CVS directories are created and are
well-formed CVS meta directories they will be maked as team-private. Please see
the class comment on SyncFileChangeListener for a caveat of setting the
team-private flag in a change listener.
Verified.  CVS meta directories are hidden from the UI when they
are marked team-private.</WithStack>

something that users would want. Having a checkbox means I have to do two 
things to say "Yes to all" when all I really want to do is click on the "Yes to

The build is a bit old, maybe you are doing better here. I've seen this same 
behaviour though - UI activation on startup is causing a lot of work to happen 
in JDT-core, and all this appears to be occuring the UI thread.

Severity 'major' was to reflect severity reported assigned to the above VCM bug.

Added reporter of VCM bug to CC of this bug.
We got many complaints when we did not persist the state of the type hierarchy. 
Users are expecting to have the workbench fully restored on start-up. Computing 
the type hierarchy isn't cheap, moving the computation in a background thread 
is not an option given that the CORE infrastructure is not thread safe.


We might want to investigate persisting hierarchies ? 
Is essentially the same as 15486.

    <WithStack>1. In Outline view select java.text.DateFormat.HOUR_OF_DAY0_FIELD
2. Search for References in workspace
==&gt; nothing found

Note 1: It finds references in .java files but not in JARs.
Note 2: Search for all Occurrences (via search dialog) correctly returns the
references
Test Case above is bogus.

Replace DateFormat.HOUR_OF_DAY0_FIELD in above test case with JavaCore.ATT_HANDLE_ID

Constants are inlined inside binaries, and thus cannot be found from the 
classfile themselves (which no longer refer to the searched field).
We would have to consider the attached sources, this is not on the plan.

Closing
I assumed this reaction BUT: it is not understandable why Search for all
occurrences finds the references.

If searching for reference is the problem then why don't you search for the
occurrences first then subtract the declarations?

Try it out for JavaCore.ATT_HANDLE_ID

We can fix this only if we index the attached source. For now, this is a known 
problem and will have to be documented.
Fixed in builds &gt; 20020701

OOPS! Touched the wrong bug. Restoring its state to LATER.

Reopening
Clearing resolution
Unclear we can do any better, easily.
Please investigate what would be the impact on the indexes (doubling the index 
size is not an option).
Deferring, shouldn't have been resurrected at this stage.
Reopening to consider for 3.5
One way to achieve this would be to index the attached source when present (instead of indexing the .class file).

Fix prototype

This patch solves the problem but is not finalized yet:
1) there are still some failing tests while running RunJavaSearchTests...
2) the way to get sources in AddJarFileToIndex assumes that files are in a peculiar order in the jar. May be this should be changed to get rid of this assumption...
3) most important point: the time to index jar files with attached sources is 8 times longer than while indexing only the binaries!

Support for queues with different priorities in JobManager/IndexManager
Created attachment 115273
New prototype merged with new support for queues

This prototype fixes comment 16 point 2) and includes the support for queues with different priorities in JobManager/IndexManager added by Jerome.

It also adds 2 new tests in JavaSearchBugTests, so added tests now cover the following scenarios:
1) jar file with sources inside
2) jar file with source in a another zip file
3) jar file with source in a folder

These 3 scenarios are now supported by this patch, but there are still several failures (28) while running RunJavaSearchTests, hence it's still a prototype...
Deferring to M4

Patch proposed for 3.5M3

This patch passed all JDT tests but was not released into M3 as its design didn't receive the agreement of all reviewers...

The proposed design alternative would be to keep one queue for the indexing but have a master switch (likely a preference) to explicitly enrich the indexes with attached sources.

So, we still need to decide which design will be used to address this issue...
Created attachment 118501
Last patch updated on top of v_925

Finally, no real agreement was possible on this bug... :-(

Modifying the indexing to allow priority queues could destabilize this part of Search and have unpredictable bugs arriving late in the game. It also does not prevent plug-in to launch low priority requests at the early beginning and slow down dramatically (may be 8 times slower!) products depending on it. This does not sound reasonable.

Having a master switch may lead to users hitting the performance issue when starting a workspace which needs a full re-indexing, but having forgot that the preference was changed in this workspace a long time ago; then, of course, raising a bug against JDT/Core complaining that the indexing is slower with the new version!

The last point is that it looks that nobody else than us (JDT) complains about this missing search matches... Either users use workaround the problem by importing source in the workspace (as I do) or never realize that there's a problem here...

So, for all these reasons, the conclusion on this is that we stop work on this bug and we will remove it from the 3.5 plan, then wait for stronger needs before restart work in this area...

Note that all the work already done here won't be done in vain as I found bug 251504 which may explain most of the unresolved problem with indexing (see bug 161409, bug 215271 and bug 108749)!
Is there any chance that this bug can be fixed in the 3.6 stream?  You had mentioned that no one complains about this bug.  But that is not true.  *I* complain about it (albeit silently, whereas I should have raised a bug).  :-)
*** Bug 226660 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>1. In Outline view select java.text.DateFormat.HOUR_OF_DAY0_FIELD
2. Search for References in workspace
==&gt; nothing found

Note 1: It finds references in .java files but not in JARs.
Note 2: Search for all Occurrences (via search dialog) correctly returns the
references
Test Case above is bogus.

Replace DateFormat.HOUR_OF_DAY0_FIELD in above test case with JavaCore.ATT_HANDLE_ID

Constants are inlined inside binaries, and thus cannot be found from the 
classfile themselves (which no longer refer to the searched field).
We would have to consider the attached sources, this is not on the plan.

Closing
I assumed this reaction BUT: it is not understandable why Search for all
occurrences finds the references.

If searching for reference is the problem then why don't you search for the
occurrences first then subtract the declarations?

Try it out for JavaCore.ATT_HANDLE_ID

We can fix this only if we index the attached source. For now, this is a known 
problem and will have to be documented.
Fixed in builds &gt; 20020701

Reopening
Clearing resolution
Unclear we can do any better, easily.
Please investigate what would be the impact on the indexes (doubling the index 
size is not an option).
Deferring, shouldn't have been resurrected at this stage.
Reopening to consider for 3.5

    <WithStack>Mousing over a method name or an object reference creates a tooltip with the description of that 
item. It would be nice to make a ui shortcut (say "Ctrl-Click") that lets the user "jump" to the 
implementation of that method, or object or the declaration of that variable (if 
available).
&lt;p&gt;
This should not be too difficult, as there must already be some lookup in 
place that allows the display of the javadoc tooltip. Proposed UI: if "Ctrl" is held down as the 
mouse moves over a recognizable string within the code, this string is underlined, and the cursor 
changes to a "hand". clicking this "link" will then take the user to the applicable version of the 
code. (For an class name - go to the class declaration, for method - it's implementation, for a 
variable the place in the code where it is declared.) If this code is not contained in the current 
file, a new editor window should be open.
&lt;p&gt;
This will make navigating and understanding 
large complex projects much easier.
This is covered by Open on Selection (F3). You only have to position the cursor 
inside the symbol.

Support for a ctrl-click is not planned for 2.0
Reopening for 2.1 consideration

This could be that something is being disposed more than once. However, we are 
supposed to be silently ignoring subsequent ones. SN to investigate.
Debug should also check to see if they're disposing twice.
How is it that this could be happening.  In Color, when hanlde == -1, we exit.  
SSQ please investigate.
The exception happens inside Device.dispose_Object() which means that
Device.objects and/or Device.errors are null. The color is probably
being disposed after the device has been disposed.

I can't see that we can do much about that.  Any suggestions?
SSQ, do you want to fix this ... low priority?

Should save view's state but only apply it if
a) editor backlinking turned off

b) no active editor - can this be tested? depends on startup sequence i.e.
editor before browsing parts or vice-versa

Added code which (re-)stores the selection. However it is not yet perfect
because normally the views listen to selection changes and show the state of the
currently selected element in the workbench. This can cause conflicts:
- editor shows x()
- another view has focus where y() is selected
- the Members view reads z() from its store
==&gt; what is the right choice for the Members view?

Need to think a bit more before releasing this one.

If there's an active non-Java Browsing part it might override the saved
selection because the Java Browsing views show/track the selection of the active
part.

In the Hierarchy View, there's a 'Previous Hierarchy Inputs' button.  It is an 
arrow pointing to the right.  This is confusing, since both IE and Netscape 
Navigator use an arrow pointing to the left for 'previous'.

I suggest that this arrow should be reversed to be consistent with IE, and with 
the normal expectations of English readers.

The depth attribute is stored in two ways.  One is as an integer while the other 
is as a string.   Only the string part gets persisted or transmitted across the 
wire.  The problem is that the int value and the string value are not always the 
same, when they should be.  I've put in a fix that will keep them in synch and 
also initiate a refresh when the depth value changes.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The folders in the navigator show up at the top, while in the Projects view they 
show up at the bottom.
It is somewhat inconsistent, and confusing when switching from one view to the 
other.
The sorting algorithm for the C/C++ projects view is based on the resource name, 
rather than the type, while the Navigator sorts by resource type and then name.  
So folders in the Project views show up in the bottom if they have 
alphabetically greater names.  If you RMC-&gt;Sort by-&gt;type, the behaviour will 
match that of the Navigator in terms of the directories always being before the 
files.  Maybe the default sorting algorithm should be the sorting by type.
Yes, it would be nice for the default to match the Navigator's behaviour.
I don't see here any C specific reason to be different.
Some of my projects show up twice in the tree in the projects view, while some 
do not.  

This happens when I start eclipse.  If I close the view and reopen it, the 
projects appear only once.

They always appear only once in the navigator view.
Ignore last comments.
Applies to old CDT codebase -- close as part of cleanup.</WithStack>

0- In order to see this problem go to the method handleVerticalScroll in 
StyledText and remove the TEMPORALLY CODE (the whole if statement). this code 
try to hide the problem a bit.

1- Run a Runtime-Workbench and open a large file in the Java Editor and 
maximize it,
a good file to test is: org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS

2- Grab the scrollbar thumb and drag it down all the way to the bottom of the 
scrollbar, pay attention how slow it is.

3- Go back to the top of the file and type something (modified the file).

4- Run the step 2 again, the scrolling time will be worse. Why ??

Sometimes to see the problem you have to play a bit more with the scrollbar 
thumb, try drag it from the top to the bottom and vice-versa a couple times.
The question here is why does this happen?  Scrolling within the StyledText 
widget will ask its content for its lines.  Why does the performance of the 
JFace content implementation degrade so much when the content has been 
modified?  This seems like it should not matter or maybe it's related to the 
java aspects of the editor.  This is worth looking into.
The document implementation used as StyledText model is untouched by any dirty 
state. Performance is exactly the same in the dirty and the non-dirty case. 
Need profiling information.

Kay, this PR is related with scrolling performance. We have changed the 
StyledText to stop using Double Buffered, what have increased the scrolling 
performance.

We are more concern about the typing performance on StyledText now.
Would be nice if you look at the PR numbers 12288 and 2537.

The main idea is do not damage the StyledText unless  you *really* need to. 
LinePainter Class is a good example where the StyledText is damage when it is 
not need.

Please, let me know if changed anything related with this issues. 

If you want to know what this PR means you need to run Eclipse on a slow (or 
regular like P3-400 256mb) machine running Linux/Motif. I don't have profiling 
data available.



Kai, what about style information?  The symptom was that modifying slowed down 
scrolling significantly.  During scrolling, lines and style information are 
asked for.  Could you just briefly double check what is occurring to the style 
state during modification?  
Based on other PRs, I assume that the described problem came from the 
implementation of the DefaultRangeIndicator. The modification at the beginning 
of test file presumably moved the outline page selection to the type OS, 
causing a long range to be marked as ruler highlight range. 
DefaultRangeIndicator change in F1.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>This is the scenario from the testcase:

1 - Open File via Double-click
	Input:
		1. Select a file
		2. Double-click the file

	Output:
		1. Expect an editor to open for the selected file if the file 
isn't already open
		2. Expect the editor to gain focus if the file is already open
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two things are different when the file is already open:
1) The cursor is brought to the first line, no matter where it was before, thus
   losing its location.
2) In Navigator, the focus is shown to appear on the file being edited by a       
   blue highlight, but when the double click is from the Projects view, 
   the blue hightlight doesn't appear on the editor view, therefore the focus 
   probably is not there either.
Same thing happens if using the RMC menu Open File.
We were jumping to line 1 when really no line was specified.  In those cases, we 
should simply jump to the editor and skip the jump to line part.   I've put the 
fix in CVS for R1 and R2.   

As for the second part of this, I don't see this anymore.  It looks like when a 
file is first opened, the tab turns blue, but if you jump around the editor or 
switch editors, the blue goes away.   I imagine that before the fix to part one 
of this, the part of the code that went to the line turned the tab from blue to 
non-blue.  Now that it's gone, it shouldn't be a problem.

I will open a separate defect for the blue focus thing.

    <WithStack>When you "Compare with Each Other", "Compare with Latest from Repo", etc., 
there is nowhere to turn on "Ignore Whitespace".

The Sync View supports it but its our action and perhaps our code.  It would 
probably be useful and appear more consistent if this was supported everywhere 
as part of the compare framework.  Don't know where we'ld hang the action in 
the editors though, perhaps it would have to be a toolbar action along 
with "Copy left to Right" etc.  Accessibility in this case?
All compare editors have a button in the toolbar for controlling the "Ignore 
Whitespace Option".

    <WithStack>It would be a great addition to have a view that permits the browsing and

I just ran into the problem where I checked in a Project that I refactored 
packages to another project.  Before I checked in the second Project, bad 
things happened to my machine and I lost the refactored Project.  When you go 
to the repository browser, of course you can no longer see the two packages 
that had been deleted.  If I had a browser that would show those to packages, 
maybe visually tagged as not present in the latest stream, and was allowed to 
browse and load previous revisions, it would have saved me considerable time.

Thanks.

I think that the ability to add date tags to the repo browser would help here. 
The user could then define a date tag at a time just before the deletions 
occured and then browse the project and it's resources at that time (or even 
check it out, if desired).

    <WithStack>I had a case where I went to change tag in the properties page and the CVS 
update received an error.

The error had the following details "cvs server: conflict: new3.txt is modified 
but no longer in the repository".  The only choice is OK, which doesn't allow 
the operation to continue and leaves you in the Properties dialog.  However, 
most of the work on the project has been completed and it shows as now being

of the following:

1. delete the file as would have happened if it didn't contain changes. This

    <WithStack>From the email posted to platform-ui mailing list:

Hi,

I'd like to work on contributing browser style navigation to Eclipse UI. I have 
a plugin you can get from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nox
that provides similar functionality, but I believe this is better provided by 
the UI itself, more so after the recent changes to handling of perspectives and 
the editor area.

I've been thinking about how to best provide this functionality in Eclipse for 
some time. I wanted to hear what everyone here thinks before actually writing 
code and see if this is feasible or even desired, so here goes:

A navigation bar that would be anchored above all the workbooks in the editor 
area, providing back and forward drop-downs along with a label that shows the 
fully qualified name of the active editor's input. Ideally, all navigation 
within the workbench such as:

 - opening files
 - performing any action on Java elements which results in opening 
   editors or revealing selections in an editor
 - performing any action on an object that implements IAdaptable
   which results in opening editors or revealing selections in an editor

should be visible in the history. At the very least, editor inputs for all 
opened files should be in the history (this would be very limited but have a 
correspondingly simple implementation).

The navigation bar can also provide a more visible UI for changing working sets 
that apply to a workbench page (considering the latest working set RFC) and 
pinning editors so they won't be reused.

I have some design ideas that I also want to discuss if this seems doable to 
the folks here.

Created attachment 507
nox.browser and nox.logger plugins
The attachment contains the nox.browser (0.6.2) and the prerequisite nox.logger 
(0.1.2) plugins. They demonstrate a possible starting point to add navigation 
functionality to Eclipse UI.

I have since fixed some rather serious memory leaks and implemented better 
representation of browsing and editor pin state, though these changes are still 
in the CVS repository and not released on the project home page.

Even though the browser plugin in its current state implements single-click 
browsing, my original proposal to the mailing list excludes this functionality.

Release notes for nox.browser and nox.logger plugins
Thanks Cagatay, I'll evaluate this and get back to you.

Cagatay,

Sorry, I've been wanting to take a look at this for ages, but have been unable 
to.  We will not be able to put this feature in for 2.0.
However, it's something I really want to look at early in 3.0.
In the meantime, people can use nox.  It would help if you could gather 
usability feedback so we have a better idea of how to add similar support to 
the Workbench in 3.0.

Reopen to investigate
I tried to use this plugin with 2.1 but I got some NPE. I would like to take a 
look on it so we can procede with the work on bug 5700. Do you have a more 
recente version? Are you still interested in working on making it part of the 
eclipse platform? I am going to mark this as dup of 5700. Please join us in the 
platform-dev-ui to talk/work on it.
Opps. Forgot to mark as dup.

    <WithOutStack>From the email posted to platform-ui mailing list:

Hi,

I'd like to work on contributing browser style navigation to Eclipse UI. I have 
a plugin you can get from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nox
that provides similar functionality, but I believe this is better provided by 
the UI itself, more so after the recent changes to handling of perspectives and 
the editor area.

I've been thinking about how to best provide this functionality in Eclipse for 
some time. I wanted to hear what everyone here thinks before actually writing 
code and see if this is feasible or even desired, so here goes:

A navigation bar that would be anchored above all the workbooks in the editor 
area, providing back and forward drop-downs along with a label that shows the 
fully qualified name of the active editor's input. Ideally, all navigation 
within the workbench such as:

 - opening files
 - performing any action on Java elements which results in opening 
   editors or revealing selections in an editor
 - performing any action on an object that implements IAdaptable
   which results in opening editors or revealing selections in an editor

should be visible in the history. At the very least, editor inputs for all 
opened files should be in the history (this would be very limited but have a 
correspondingly simple implementation).

The navigation bar can also provide a more visible UI for changing working sets 
that apply to a workbench page (considering the latest working set RFC) and 
pinning editors so they won't be reused.

I have some design ideas that I also want to discuss if this seems doable to 
the folks here.

nox.browser and nox.logger plugins
The attachment contains the nox.browser (0.6.2) and the prerequisite nox.logger 
(0.1.2) plugins. They demonstrate a possible starting point to add navigation 
functionality to Eclipse UI.

I have since fixed some rather serious memory leaks and implemented better 
representation of browsing and editor pin state, though these changes are still 
in the CVS repository and not released on the project home page.

Even though the browser plugin in its current state implements single-click 
browsing, my original proposal to the mailing list excludes this functionality. 
I came to think that it would be better if this is left to individual views. 
However, the browser plugin itself depends on selection changes to implement 
navigation as it currently stands.

    <WithStack>The idea behind the Command launcher is that the commands are issued from within 
the context of some directory.  Therefore the command history need to be 
remembered in association with the directory in which a resource is found, not 
with the individual resource that might be selected at the time.  

Because of the current problem, when right mouse click on the directory, the
menu item "Command History" will show only the commands issued while the 
directory itself was selected.
This is a bit tricky;  if we let any selected file to set the context of the 
command, then we should accordingly add a RMC menu item for "Command History" at 
the resource level, not only at the directory level.


I've changed this so that only the directory retains the history, not the file.  
This makes the menu action consistant with the history behaviour and I think 
this is the solution with the least amount of holes.

    <WithStack>A reminder that when we add refreshing ability for sync info that we ensure that
the CVS/Entry file formats are compatible. We used to have timestamp
compatibility tests, they should be added again:

From the newsgroup:

It seems that the timestamp format in the CVS/Entries file created by
Eclipse includes the leading 0 for days 1 to 9, where the cvs command
line client does not.

Here is an example line from CVS/Entries created by Eclipse

/PooledConnectionFactory.java/1.3/Fri Mar 03 22:29:00 2000//

and the corresponding line from the cvs command line client

/PooledConnectionFactory.java/1.3/Fri Mar  3 22:29:00 2000//

A script uses the cvs command line client to perform the initial checkout.
Eclipse Java
projects are created at locations within the directory tree created by the
checkout, then
Team-&gt;Share Project... is used to connect using the existing CVS/
directories.

Eclipse sees those files with timestamps between the 1'st and 9'th of the
month as
not in sync with the repository. A Team-&gt;Update fixes this, but seems to
causes all
of the affected files to be unnecessarily fetched from the repository again.

As a test, org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.syncinfo.ResourceSyncInfo was
modified
to convert outgoing timestamps from the format Fri Mar 03 to Fri Mar  3 -
method
getEntryLine(boolean includeTimeStamp); and convert incoming timestamps from
the format Fri Mar  3 to Fri Mar 03 - method getTimeStamp(). With the test
code
in place, the files checked out by the cvs command line client now appear to
Eclipse
as insync with the repository without having Eclipse perform Team-&gt;Update.
Will fix as part of command line compatibility support for M5.
Fixed in build &gt; 20020327

Timestamps are no longer saved as strings, instead Date instances are used for
storage in ResourceSyncInfo and compare to determine dirtyness of files. This
allows isolating small variances in date formats (e.g. padding with zeros or
spaces) in the date parser and they won't affect the actual timestamp value.
Please reopen.

    <WithStack>Help browser on Windows needs to move above all shells, when called to display 
some help URL.  When the browser window is open it appears on the top, but when 
it is subsequently called to display URLs and move above, it sometimes stays 
behind other windows.  The browser window runs in a separate process from 
Eclipse.

We have tried different combinations of:
 shell.setVisible(true);
 shell.moveAbove(null);
 shell.focus();
 shell.forceFocus();
 shell.open();
None seems to produce result that works all the time.
It either works on some win2k systems, but not on others,
or it works 2 times after opening shell and not the 3rd time,
or it works if help browser is behind Eclipse, but not if behind other program 
window.

One way to reproduce:
1. Launch Eclipse Workbench.
2. Select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; help browser 
opens on top of Eclipse.
3. In workbench select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; help 
browser moves above Eclipse.
4a. In workbench select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; 
help browser stays behind Eclipse.
4b. If in 4a help browser moved above Eclipse try this:  Open another 
application on the top of help browser, switch to Workbench, in workbench 
select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; help browser stays 
behind Eclipse.

If it helps to look or experiment with our code, the help browser is a 
org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.browser.win32.IEHost class in the 
org.eclipse.help.ui project.
There is no API currently for moving the window to the front of *all* windows 
on the desktop. "moveAbove" is only capable of moving a shell to the front of 
all shells created on a particular org.eclipse.swt.widgets.DIsplay. Focus 
setting API only control where keyboard focus -- it's typically under the 
window manager's control whether or not this leads to the widget being raised, 
and is one of those user configurable options that people get passionate about.

Changing this bug to an "enhancement" to indicate that this is a new feature 
request.


On windows platforms prior to Win2K, the following line of code will bring a 
window in front of all others regardless of who created them:
    org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SetForegroundWindow(shell.handle);

Unfortunately, on Win2K and WinXP, if the process making the call isn't the 
front window, the above line of code simply causes "shell"'s title in the 
Windows task bar to flash. Note that this is *correct* behavior on these 
platforms. On these platforms, there is no guaranteed way to bring a window in 
front of all others.

On X windows, the window manager has ultimate control over when a window will 
come to the front. In our code, moveAbove(...) calls XReconfigureWMWindow 
(with stack_mode == ABOVE), which should do the right thing. However, if it 
does not for a particular window manager, we can not fix it.

So, _AS_A_TEST_ to see if the win32 behavior is acceptable on win2K and XP, I 
suggest you call the above SetForegroundWindow call yourself after you open 
the help window. If you think this works acceptably, then let us know and we 
will create a public API that provides access to it on win32, but is 
equivalent to "moveAbove(null)" on linux.

This is the best we can do for you.

org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SetForegroundWindow(shell.handle); does what 
I need.  It is the expected behavior.

If Windows 2000 and XP bring windows to top or flash task bar button is 
configurable.  You can use Microsoft Tweak UI to change this.  If you 
deselect "Prevent Application from stealing focus", the code that you suggested 
will bring the window to top as in older versions of Windows.

Please, make the API public for doing 
org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SetForegroundWindow(shell.handle); public, or 
cause shell.moveAbove(null); to call above behind scenes on Win32.

See Shell.setActive() and Shell.forceActive().</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Help browser on Windows needs to move above all shells, when called to display 
some help URL.  When the browser window is open it appears on the top, but when 
it is subsequently called to display URLs and move above, it sometimes stays 
behind other windows.  The browser window runs in a separate process from 
Eclipse.

We have tried different combinations of:
 shell.setVisible(true);
 shell.moveAbove(null);
 shell.focus();
 shell.forceFocus();
 shell.open();
None seems to produce result that works all the time.
It either works on some win2k systems, but not on others,
or it works 2 times after opening shell and not the 3rd time,
or it works if help browser is behind Eclipse, but not if behind other program 
window.

One way to reproduce:
1. Launch Eclipse Workbench.
2. Select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; help browser 
opens on top of Eclipse.
3. In workbench select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; help 
browser moves above Eclipse.
4a. In workbench select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; 
help browser stays behind Eclipse.
4b. If in 4a help browser moved above Eclipse try this:  Open another 
application on the top of help browser, switch to Workbench, in workbench 
select navigator view, press F1, chose one of the links -&gt; help browser stays 
behind Eclipse.

If it helps to look or experiment with our code, the help browser is a 
org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.browser.win32.IEHost class in the 
org.eclipse.help.ui project.
There is no API currently for moving the window to the front of *all* windows 
on the desktop. "moveAbove" is only capable of moving a shell to the front of 
all shells created on a particular org.eclipse.swt.widgets.DIsplay. Focus 
setting API only control where keyboard focus -- it's typically under the 
window manager's control whether or not this leads to the widget being raised, 
and is one of those user configurable options that people get passionate about.

Changing this bug to an "enhancement" to indicate that this is a new feature 
request.


On windows platforms prior to Win2K, the following line of code will bring a 
window in front of all others regardless of who created them:
    org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SetForegroundWindow(shell.handle);

Unfortunately, on Win2K and WinXP, if the process making the call isn't the 
front window, the above line of code simply causes "shell"'s title in the 
Windows task bar to flash. Note that this is *correct* behavior on these 
platforms. On these platforms, there is no guaranteed way to bring a window in 
front of all others.

On X windows, the window manager has ultimate control over when a window will 
come to the front. In our code, moveAbove(...) calls XReconfigureWMWindow 
(with stack_mode == ABOVE), which should do the right thing. However, if it 
does not for a particular window manager, we can not fix it.

So, _AS_A_TEST_ to see if the win32 behavior is acceptable on win2K and XP, I 
suggest you call the above SetForegroundWindow call yourself after you open

Were you inside a resource perspective when you imported your project ?
That could explain this behavior, since until the Java perspective is activated 
(JavaUI gets loaded and defines variables JRE_LIB).

As soon as you go and check the Java preferences, then it gets loaded and 
subsequent builds will work fine.

JDT/Core now provides variable initialization extension point, which the JDT/UI 
or launcher is supposed to extend.

Passing onto JDT/UI for comment.
the extension points needs to be implemented by org.eclipse.jdt.launching 
moving to Debug
Waiting to coordinate with JDT to change how the classpath variables are 
initialized.

    <WithStack>If you change the Repo Location fields from the project associated with the 
location, it creates a new location, which is probably not what someone expects.

Also, we don't have a "Properties" menu on CVS Location itself, to allow you to 
change the user name/etc.

The result is that its confusing for the user to understand what's shared and 
what isn't - ie. whether they are editing a shared location or a copy of it.

At a minimum, a user needs to be able to change their password on a location.  
Changing it for an individual project is tedious and not what they'd expect.

We should:

- For a project, allow the user to change the location associated with the 
project provided the location has the same machine name and path (ie. the bits 
you can't change right now which determine uniqueness).

- As a bonus, provide an "Edit" button in the Project-&gt;Properties-&gt;CVS which 
makes it clear that the user is editing the values of a shared location.

- Allow the editing of the changeable fields (connect method, name, password) 
on repo locations in the Repository View.

I attached an Eclipse error report file for this bug.  I am currently using
Build 20020412.  I can easily reproduce it on my system by trying to expand
anything in the Navigator panel and the Java panel. I believe it began when I
installed KDE3.

I also get the same error on Build 20020321 but at startup.  I didn't get this
error while using KDE 2, only since going to KDE 3.

This is a fairly old bug report.  Is this problem still occuring?
If so, can you please specify which version of gtk you have installed and also 
with which version of Eclipse you have most recently experienced this problem.
Note that it's a motif issue, not gtk.

The bug does not appear anymore i.e., after release 2.0.

    <WithStack>It would be nifty to have a radio button when setting CVS location

would disable the name/password fields, supplying instead the name Anonymous 
and empty password.

Helpful for those like me who can't remember how to spell anonymous, and nifty 
piece of polish.
post 2.0
It seems that every cvs repository uses a different username for anonymous.
Sometimes they use the name of the project (e.g. 'eclipse'), sometimes
'anonymous', 'anon', 'cvs', 'anoncvs', 'guest' and others. (Sourceforge does use
'anonymous', however).

'anonymous', however).

    <WithStack>Sometimes in the course of refactoring, I'll realize that I've got
an inner class that does not reference the outer class's fields in
any way, so I mark it 'static'.  Later on, I want to move this static
inner class to its own compilation unit, or (rarely) to inside some
other class.

In the most common case, Inner has no references to any members
or fields of Outer, and all I want to do is grab it and create
a new compilation unit.
e.g.
  public class Outer {
    // stuff
    public static class Inner {
      // other stuff
    }
  }

Just supporting this behaviour would be good enough, except
sometimes (rarely), Inner references some static fields or members
of Outer.  In which case, precondition checking would have to
verify that they are visible from the new location, and the refactoring
would expand the scoped references as needed for the new context.
agreed that this would be useful, but cannot committ to it for 2.0

For non-static inner classes, the implicit reference to the outer class
should be made explicit if required.

I guess initialy the refactoring could be allowed only when the inner class
doesn't use non-public features of the outer class.

Oops!
I just tried this out again and it worked fine.  When I filed this
report, I had just selected a static field and did Refactor-&gt;Move.
The class picker dialog was not showing me any interfaces, however.

it should actually be disabled (i'm surprised you managed to move it)

as of now, only interface fields can be moved to another interface
it'd be possible to move also public static final fields

    <WithStack>from the newsgroup:
At some point between eclipse-SDK-20020125-win32 and
eclipse-SDK-20020314-win32, a couple of things seem to have happened to
F1/context help calls. First, it looks like we can no longer externalize
strings from the XML that determines the context help. And, second,
&lt;description&gt; tag special characters (\ (escape), \n (hard return),
etc.) and whitespace inside of the &lt;description&gt; tags are being rendered
in the infopops.

I'm just wondering if the plan is to have both or either of these
changes stay for R2.0, before I start fixing (not that I'm thrilled with
either change). I had read up on migrating help to R2.0 (migration doc
off of
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-help-
home/dev.html,
etc.) and fixed my Help Contents-producing XML not to externalize
strings - but the migration doc only mentioned that this required for
the toc files (not the context files). And the Help System extension
points for Contexts help page still tells us that we can externalize
strings. I've found no info about the special characters and whitespace.

I would have looked for bugs, but I'm noticing that org.eclipse plug-ins
that contain context help XML no longer externalize strings, etc. (they
did in previous builds), so I am assuming that what I'm noticing is here
to stay. Incidentally, if both are here to stay, will there be a
substitute for formatting &lt;description&gt; tag contents (I mean in the
source)?

Help docs do not say that \n is supported.  Basically for escaping special 
characters, rules for XML PCDATA sections apply now, instead of rules for Java 
properties.
You can use &amp;#x0A; or literaly have new line in the XML for the new line.

I see a problem of context extension point still refering to property files and 
a need for documenting migration steps for F1 contributions.

The document for context extension point that is in org.eclipse.help/doc 
directory is correct and does not mention externalizing context strings into 
property files.  It mentioned externalizing strings from plugin.xml to 
plugin.properties.  I have cleaned that part, too to eliminate confusion.

You must have been looking in the Eclipse 1.0 documentation if you found 
references to context.properties.  Documentaton for Eclipse 2.0 has not been 
build yet.  When it is, it will pick documents from org.eclipse.help/doc 
directory.

What is left is the need for a document describing migration of context 
contribution, but it is not really a bug.  I will change this bug to 
enhancement.

    <WithStack>Hello,
 
this message is related to the "news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.tools"-thread:
      "My Problems with Projects, Source- and Classpathes"
 
What I do to deal with eclipses rebuild-problems is: I use Linux
Konquerer to search and delete all class files in my workspace and then I
recompile "Workbench-&gt;Rebuild All" with eclipse 
(a few times until all errors are gone). 
The wanted menuitem should do exatly that, i.e. no denpendency
checking or other complcated calculation (approximatly 30 lines off
code).

This is not as useless as it sounds, because 1 or 2 classes are
sometimes compiled with errors, but a regular "Workbench-&gt;Rebuild All"
shows no errors.
 
I can't make this a real report because it is very hard to find a
small reproducable example. But I have every week a handful of such
examples (they are reproducable but not small).
Perhaps somebody can confirm this.
 
My Konqueror method now becomes unhandy because now the ".metadata"
folder in the workspace has class-files too (what do they do there??),
and I'm always in danger to delete them.
I got into a similar state recently.  At some point, I changed my output
folder from being the project itself to a /bin subdirectory.  Later,
invocations of "rebuild all" showed no errors in the UI, but I would get
compilation error messages at runtime.  Finally, I realized that I had
.class files for some of the same classes in both the project directory and
the /bin subdirectory, and "rebuild all" was only scrubbing the /bin
directory (since that was the current location).  I had to use Windows
explorer to delete all .class files in all the project's directories, and
voila, problem solved.

In short, such a feature would be nice (though might be difficult to name or
explain).
At the point the binary output is changed, UI might want to propose to flush 
pre-existing class files in previous location.

Moving to UI
&gt;This is not as useless as it sounds, because 1 or 2 classes are
&gt;sometimes compiled with errors, but a regular "Workbench-&gt;Rebuild All"
&gt;shows no errors.
this looks like a bug, if you have a reproducable case pls file it against JDT 
core. 

I agree with Philippe that the UI should be more supportive when the user 
changes the output folder. I expect it will be common that users start with a 
simple project layout (output= project) and as the project grows they migrate 
to use source folders. 
jdt-ui does not know which files it could delete (difficult when the previous 
location was the project). JCore could do this on setOutputLocation.

or I need an API flushOutputLocation that I would call before setting the new 
output location.

I don't think you would need anything more than 'flush all classfiles'. 

Note that any CLASS file in this folder would be ignored anyway, so if there 
was any, it better go away. If you want to be conservative, then you could 
discard all GENERATED ones (those tagged as  such).
when the output folder location changes we are now prompting the user whether 
class files should be removed.</WithStack>

lines and as a result you can view more lines with 
real content. And I think it looks very nice ;-)

Resurrecting formatter issues in 2.1 stream.
Clearing resolution
We need to clear 2.1 bug reports that won't be addressed before 2.1. The new 
implementation is still in the works. Therefore we cannot include it for 2.1. 
Not enough testing and we need to polish the preferences. This will be address

When creating a shared launch configuration for a project that is stored in
a custom location, an error dialog is displayed:

An exception occured while retrieving launch configurations.
Reason:
Launch configuration does not exist.

This dialog keeps popping up several times whenever the launch configuration
is accessed and you have to restart.

NB: A file called &lt;launchconf&gt;.launch was created in the specified directory.
I have not been able to reproduce this problem in the latest code base. Marking 
as "works for me". Please retry in the next integration build, and re-open if 
still a problem.
For the record, I just saw this exact problem after installing the stable build
20020416 on Win2K.   I created 3 launch configurations and after each one this
error occurs and the Edit Configurations dialog became brain dead until I
restarted eclipse. 
 
Re-opening
Boris or Mike, do you still see this problem, and if so, can you attach the exception you get to this 
bug report?  THanks.
Created attachment 731
.log from attempt to create new shared configuration, Linux M5 build
Mike, Buzilla seems to have done something with your attachment.  Could you re-attach it?  Thanks.
Attachment id=731 appears to be intact.  Looks fine to me when I click on the link
in bug report.
Hmm, one browser shows the attachment, another one doesn't.  In any case, Mike, can you give me the 
steps you used to create the shared configs?  Did you click New in the dialog, or did you use the 
cascade menu to create a new config of a specified type?  Did you click Apply, then launch, or did you 
just click launch?

Thanks,
Joe
- Click New in Launch Configurations dialog
- Fill in main class
- Change name from new configuration to something else (like test)
- Click on Common tab
- Select Shared 
- Click Browse, choose root dir of current project as location
- Press Apply 
Wham-o.   Exception occurred....

My first dozen or so attempts to duplicate this came up empty.  Are there any other details you could 
provide Mike?  You mentioned the build you are using, what about platform?  Also, your steps to re-
create the problem start with clicking New in the dialog.  What action did you take to bring up the 
dialog?  Was anything selected in the workbench and were there any open editors when you did this?  
Also, I assume you were creating a new Local Java Application?
By the way, thanks very much for 
working with me to try and pin this down.
This error is consistently repeatable on both Linux and Win2K.  I activate the
Launch Configurations dialog by clicking on the down arrow beside the "run"
button on the toolbar and choosing Edit Configurations (is there another
way???).  The Java perspective is open, with several files open in editors.  The
problem occurs with the project name selected in the packages view, but I don't
think this matters.  I am trying to create Java Application launchers.   JVM is
IBM 1.3.0 (Linux JVM build number is cx130-20020124, Windows build number is
cn130-20020124).  

Another thing I just noticed.  I selected one of the dummy launchers I created
to respond to your questions, and selected the Delete button.  The launcher does
not disappear from the tree on the left of the Launch Configurations dialog.  No
exception occurs, but it is otherwise like create in that you have to
exit/restart eclipse to get the delete to take effect.
The key to reproducing this problem is that you have to create a project 
outside the workspace. On the first page of the Java Project wizard, uncheck 
"Use default location" and select another directory. The problem is then 
easily reproducible.
OK, finally able to duplicate.  The problem is that the ContainerSelectionDialog used to collect 
the shared config location is returning an IPath for external projects that make them look as if 
they are 'internal' projects.  Thus, getInfo() goes off to a non-existant directory looking for 
the config's XML.  Waiting to hear from UI team.
Fixed.  The REAL problem was that LaunchManagerVisitor.visit() was hard-coded to expect a config 
to be underneath the workspace root.  Changed to use whatever the launch config file reports as its 
path.
Please verify.

to be underneath the workspace root.  Changed to use whatever the launch config file reports as its 
path.
Please verify.

    <WithStack>If the java.exe VM is supplied, the Eclipse loader should suppress the console 
window which pops up on Windows platforms with VMs &lt; 1.4.x.

This fix is done by using createProcess() instead of _spawnv() to create the VM.
This does have the implication that the debug window will not be displayed if 
the -debug option is specified, therefore a check should be done for this 
special case.

Fixing the loader and then specifying java.exe as the VM will fix the all cases 
where external executable execution causes a console window to pop up.
Created attachment 509
Modified eclipseWin.c which implements the hiding
Created attachment 510
Patch version of modified eclipseWin.c
Note that patch and modified eclipseWin.c may not reflect the latest build, 
they were done against 20020214 if memory serves correctly.
Moving to McQ as it is an issue with the executable.
Presumably, if the user specifed java.exe, then he *wants* the console window, 
since he can specify javaw.exe if he does not. Why is this change a win?

Not necessarily, the only reason I specify it for example is to suppress 
additional console windows popping up when external commands are executed
in the IDE. These additional windows pop up (2-3 at a time) when javaw.exe is
specified, but not java.exe...Sun VM bug. Example: every time CVS is accessed 
using the 'ext' mechanism, or Ant executes external commands.

However, if 2.0 is going to require J2SE 1.4, then this is not an issue.
Adding JM to CC list to see Leon's last comment.

Yes, we (the Team team) basically just do a Runtime.exec("ssh.exe"); to spawn 
the ssh instances. As far as I know we have no control over whether a console 
window pops up; that seems to be a function of the .exe that was run. If anyone 
has any info to the contrary I'd love to fix it.
No way to do it using Java itself :(

It is "fixed" in 1.4, not at the library level, but as a VM hack.

The workaround for 1.3.x and earlier VMs seems to be use java.exe as the VM, 
and hide the once-off console window that appears if applicable.

The bug reports:

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4244515.html
http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4109888.html
As I suspected. :-( How unfortunate.

The VCM team will take no action on this.

What is the "VM Hack" you mention for 1.4 VMs? Does the user have to explicitly
enable it (e.g. with a command-line param) or is it enabled by default?
It is enabled by default.
Note that the extra windows are also suppressed if you use J9 1.5 or higher as 
your VM.
there seems to be no way to cleanly resolve this for all users without losing 
some functionality, and i think we can safely assume most people will be using 
1.4+ VMs to run Eclipse, so i'd say this could be resolved.
KC and I should discuss this again once he's got a free moment.
moving to SWT ofr consideration (they own the executable)

Note that there are other cases where you want the console.  -console, -
consolelog are two.  There may be others.
SSQ, this is really old and may be out of date now?  Jeff is cleaning house.

    <WithStack>Code generations that contains handling of exceptions (like "surround with 
try/catch" and the "extract method" refactoring) tend to include handling of 
RuntimeExceptions and Errors, which often is undesired.

Please provide means to disable this behaviour.
It should be a general coding preference whether unchecked exception should be 
included in the generated method.
I don't agree with this. The current behavior is as follows:

if the set of selected statements contain a method call which declaration 
declares thrown runtime exceptions or error, the extracted method declares the 
runtimer exceptions as well. Here is an example:

public class E {
    public void bar() throws NullPointerException {
        throw new NullPointerException();
    }
    public void baz() {
    }

    public void foo() {
        bar();
        baz();
    }
}

extracting the method call bar creates a new method that throws a 
NullPointerExcpetion. Extracting the method call baz() doesn't.

The same is true for surround with try/catch. IMO this a proper behavior since 
it keeps to the "documentation" of thrown RuntimeExceptions or Errors.

Any objection to close the PR ?
My problem is regarding libraries like JAXP. For example, 
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance() declares to throw a 
FactoryConfigurationError. There are many other examples.

I would really like to disable catching these by default. Please make this an 
option.
So you concern is more with surround with try/catch then with extract method ?
Well, yes, as "surround with try/catch" generates more code and has direct 
impact on functionality. So I always have to delete this code, whereas I can 
live with an oversized throws-clause (if I have to...).
Surround with try catch doesn't generate a catch block for Runtime exceptions 
anymore even if they are declared in the signature of a called method.

Extract method has an option in the wizard.

It has to do with the way Eclipse computes plug-in classpaths. It does 
disconsiders any classpath added before Eclipse starts and computes its own 
based on the plugins and fragments. Search the newsgroup for Ant and JUnit in 
order to find a workaround for your problem (adding a fragment to 
org.eclipse.ant with the necessary jars).

    <WithStack>JAWS for Windows 3.7 (Screen Reader Program) can not read TabItem's text.

User could not know;
-There are multi pages
-Page is switched by cursor key
JAWS 4.01 does not have a problem reading tab groups in build 20020322. Which 
build of 2.0 are you running in? Also be aware that JAWS 3.7 didn't read a lot 
widgets (I couldn't get it to read the contents of a text entry field) whereas 
4.01 has no trouble with this.

Specifically which tab group is having the problem?
I installed JAWS 4.02 and found it has no problem.
Please close this.

    <WithStack>Hello,
It would be nice to include the JAD plugin in the default distribution of 
Eclipse.

Not planned for 2.0. There is a feature request in JDT UI to show disassembled 
byte codes for types with no source. However, it is a JDT UI issue (not a 
debugger issue).</WithStack>
