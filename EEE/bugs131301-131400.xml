    <WithStack>According to:
http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/ref/rom/structs/ConfigVar.html 

The config[] array should hold enviroment vars.

I set Deployment=test as a system environment variable in XP, fired up eclipse with birt, and tried us use the following in the  data source property binding for URL:

if (config["Deployment"]=="test") {"jdbc:oracle:thin:@test:1521:db"; } else {"jdbc:oracle:thin:@live:1521:db"; }

This throws an exception that config["Deployment"] doesnt exist.  

I also tried setting Deployment as a -D parameter in the eclipse startup short cust as follows:

"C:\Program Files\eclipse311\eclipse.exe" -vmargs -Xmx512M -DDeployment=test

and also

"C:\Program Files\eclipse311\eclipse.exe" -vmargs -Xmx512M -DDeployment.test (this is how it was documented in one example)

This did not help.

How do we get Birt to switch DB based on the environment?
It needs to be supported by Engine.

    <WithStack>Hello,

I created a simple report which shows just a table.
I wanted to modify the thickness of a cell's border.
In the designer one can choose only a graphical value
(a thin line, a normal line and a thick line)
I choosed the thine one, in the designer the cell has a thin border (1px) but if I run the report the cell's border is 2px.
(see attachment birt.jpg)

1. Please correct this, the result thickness should be same as design thickness

Design and production impression of cell border thickness
In CSS specification, it doesn't define the width of thin, medium and thick, the only requirement is 'thin' &lt;= 'midium' &lt;= 'thick'. The absolut value depends on the user agents. IE implements the 'thin' as 2 px while MOZILLA implements it as 1 px.

The user can specify the border-with to '1px' to get the exactly 1px width border.
That's not the problem of designer for we can support it without any problem.
Please try to close it under engine's name.

Qiangsheng,  I wasn't able to find the UI to set the border thickness such as border-with to an absolute px value in the property editor but I can set it to 1px in the property sheet's "..." (not the property editor but the Eclipse built in one).  It would be an enhancement to add similar setting dialog in property editor.

T.M.  you can set the border width to 1px in table's propert sheet if you want to have it fix to 1 px in all output browsers.
That's not the case.
If user select thickness, user select a predefined border. That thickness defined in GUI is 1 px. And looks ie and mozilla have different definition.

If user set border to 1 px, that's another case. Property editor may need enhance to support input absolute border value. We can file another enhacement to support it.
since different browser treat thin differently, so if the report is to have a 1px border, it should not use thin as the border thickness.  

Change this bug to enhancement to add UI to set border width as absolute numbers such as 1px.  or we can cancel this bug as invlid and log another enhancement.
Consider to allow user input absolute value.
Fixed it.Add some px choices in the width combo.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Added JDBC Driver URL and password property bindings to my data source in the library.  Saved the library.

Opened the report with the data source, it didnt get the changes.  So deleted the datasource from the report, and copied the new one into it from the library explorer (dong a refresh first).  Checked the property bindings in the report - still missing.  Tried again closing all files first, still no bindings.

had to manually copy in the bindings to every report.
The reason looks like Model does not support it.
Maybe model can't fix this bug. This bug is similar to datasource. When copy table or list which contains datasource , dataset or property bindings , just copy table or list without copying datasource ,dataset and property bindings.And maybe in library it is not very right to support property bindings , propery bindings is only useful in report design.
We have reviewed this and concluded that this is an intended behavior of the Property Binding feature. Property binding is designed to "bind" or associate a data element with properties local to a report design (such as its report parameters). It is therefore always local to a report. It will not be copied together with the data set or data source when the data element is copied from one library/report to another.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I use ModelBus V1 and have a provider running inside of eclipse with the ModelBus V1 eclipse plug-in. I test this provider in a runtime workbench. When I have this provider started and I shutdown the runtime workbench I see that the workbench never stops, I have to terminate it manually. 
I have also seen that I cannot switch workspaces either, eclipse appears to shutdown but never re-initialises. I believe this is the same problem. I only get this problem when I start my provider. I have debugged my provider and it executes the plugin shutdown code which undeploys the adapter and then ends. What I do find though is that there is a thread running the simple axis server blocking on a server socket listen and it could be that because this thread cannot terminate it stops the whole of eclipse terminating.
The bug is fixed.
The updated version of Adapter is in the CVS
This works for so, so register it as fixed</WithStack>

You only find tabs. Those that came from the template itself are OK, but

    <WithStack>If getAdapter(Object, Class) is called several times on an IWorkbenchPart the AdapterTrackerFactory attaches always a new ISelectionTracker to the IWorkbenchPart although its suppost to only attach one instance.
This doesn't lead to unintentional behavior, it can lead to performance losses though.
In principal the org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList.add(Object) method should check if an identical listener is already presented. The comparison is done by identity and not by equality however.

    <WithStack>It would help usability a lot if the chart builder was sticky:

- Open chart builder, go to a tab, open a docked popup, close the builder. Open 
the builder: it goes back to the same tab, with the same popup active (if 
available on the given chart)
- Open chart builder, go to format chart tab, open a docked popup. Click on 
different node on the left tree, if the popup is also available here, leave it 
open and refresh its content for the new node. For example clicking on X Axis, 
Y Axis with Text Format popup open.
- Open chart builder, go to format chart tab. select a node in the tree, open a 
dockup popup, go back to select data tab, go back to format chart tab: the last 
selected node is still active and the popup is back.

There might be some other scenarios, but that gives you the idea: make the user 
experience easier, you always expect things to be like you left them and not to 
be reset each time. This is particularly useful when you set similar properties 
on different elements (like font, or palette colors), or when you experiment 
some interactive properties and use report preview to fine-tume them(so the 
builder gets closed and opened multiple times)
Added sticky behavior for subtask and popup selection, the logic is below:
1. Once user brought up the popup, to store the selection in current subtask and compond task.
2. If compound task selection is not null and existent in current subtask, to bring up the popup.
3. If compound task selection is not existent, to bring up the popup stored in the subtask.

AIX Server: Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.17 (client/server)

We are having a problem with checking out a particular project so the error from the server is expected.   i.e. we get the same error running cvs from the command line.

I opened this bug because Eclipse doesn't handle the error.

During the checkout of the project that causes the error (progress dialog is displayed)
1) the progress dialog is dismissed before the checkout has completed

    <WithOutStack>R3.2M5 on WinXP Pro SP2
AIX Server: Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.17 (client/server)

We are having a problem with checking out a particular project so the error from the server is expected.   i.e. we get the same error running cvs from the command line.

I opened this bug because Eclipse doesn't handle the error.

During the checkout of the project that causes the error (progress dialog is displayed)
1) the progress dialog is dismissed before the checkout has completed 
2) the outline of a window frame flashes, I assume it is about to display an error dialog but it goes away before there is any content in the error dialog
3) The conveyor icon (task icon?) has an error decorator (I have attached a screen cap) and the hover text says to press button for details
4) pressing the button does nothing (I believe it should open the cvs console with the error
5) There is a CVSException in the Error Log

    <WithStack>On a maximized pane changing the tab order via drag &amp; drop restores the pane, i.e. it gets back to normal size. This is really annoying, especially if in the restored pane some of the tabs are hidden (not enough space to show all tab headers in the pane). This makes it sometimes impossible to change the order as the tab, where the other one should be placed before or after has been hidden.
Is this still a problem in 3.3?

    <WithStack>It would be really nice if the updater could "remember" what server I have selected in the past (either for all of my updates or for a particular plugin), or perhaps select/set a default mirror in the Update dialog, and/or be able to set and/or modify it in the Update Preferences.  I guess it would be nice to start the update service (once I have the server(s) set) and come back a few minutes later and everything is done instead of having to wait and select a server by hand.  

Thanks,
Jim

    <WithStack>Dear Sir,

I am facing a unique problem. I have devloped a project in j2ee. When I am inserting the data in the table the its working fine and the values which are getting in the table are correct but when I retrive these values and edit them and save then the junk values are getting stored in the table.
Could you please at least give some examples?
Can you build a small code snippet that shows the problem?

This doesn't seem to be a problem with the compiler.
This looks more as an issue with JDBC.
Is it working outside of Eclipse with the same data?
no Sir, but this is what I can test upon.Is there a driver problem?

    <WithOutStack>Dear Sir,

I am facing a unique problem. I have devloped a project in j2ee. When I am inserting the data in the table the its working fine and the values which are getting in the table are correct but when I retrive these values and edit them and save then the junk values are getting stored in the table.
Could you please at least give some examples?
Can you build a small code snippet that shows the problem?

    <WithStack>Content providers, label providers and action providers are all initialized with a site. The same does not seem to be true for sorters. My problem is this. I want to have a context menu that allwos the user to pick the sort order. I don't want the sort order to be a global setting so I would like to put in somewhere local to the view (like the IExtensionStateModel). I can put it there eazsily enough but, unfortunately, I don't see any easy way to access the sort order from the sorter. As a workaround, I think I will be able to find the sorter through the sorter service but a more direct method would be preferable.
Currently the sorter implementations are not specialized; A change like this would require that (ICommonViewerSorter or CommonViewerSorter). Is this implicit in your proposal or is there another way that you think would make sense?
It would also work if there was an easy way to get the sorter given a content extension id. I could then cast the sorter to my known sublcass and set any fields I need to.
Note that to work around this I use used the INavigatorSorter#findSorter method. However, I had to really dig to get the right descriptor and had to make up some fake elements to pass to the find sorter method.
A related issue is that the ICommonContentExtensionSite does not provide access to the INavigatorContentService. To make my workaround for this bug work, I had to cast to CommonExtensionSite which is internal. Granted, when the original problem is addressed, I probably won't need to access the service from my content provider but it may be generally helpful to make the content servive available off the content provider site.
Is there sufficient reason that this should be released in 3.2.1 or is 3.3 okay?
I have a workaround so 3.3 is fine.

+ Added ICommonContentExtensionSite.getService() : INavigatorContentService
+ Added INavigtatorContentService.getContentDescriptorById(String): INavigatorContentDescriptor
+ Added INavigatorSorterService.findAvailableSorters(INavigatorContentDescriptor) : Map &lt;String(id), ViewerSorter&gt;

There is a test in ProgrammaticOpenTest under navigator.tests that verifies the operation and correct behavior when no id is specified for the commonSorter (which is not required). 

Fixed and released to HEAD.</WithStack>

Trying to Quick-Fix the "if(entered)" statement, the result is "MouseAdapter.this.entered", which results in a compilation problem. 
I don't know what would be the correct way to access this field qualified, so let me please know when resolving this issue ;)
I have to disappoint you, it's not possible.

Btw, nice code;-) Be careful with race conditions...

        this.entered = false;
      }
    });
  }
}

Trying to Quick-Fix the "if(entered)" statement, the result is "MouseAdapter.this.entered", which results in a compilation problem. 
I don't know what would be the correct way to access this field qualified, so let me please know when resolving this issue ;)
I have to disappoint you, it's not possible.

Btw, nice code;-) Be careful with race conditions...

Rick,

One of the great things about open source is the opportunity to get a look at all the interesting new projects that are out there.  JCR and Jackrabbit are new ones for me, but they look very promising.

BIRT has left the entire storage side of reports both for the report designs and report documents open, so there is no built in support for JCR or JSR-170.

If you could provide an enhancement request for JCR support we can look at adding it in a future BIRT release.  We track enhancements in Bugzilla https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=BIRT.

Looks like the bug reporter needs a new ODA data source which can support JSR-170 compliant Java Content Repository. If so, we need a lot of time to implement it for driver and UI, and then I put it into 2.1.0 final as temp target.
Wenfeng, can you set its target?
This is an enhancement in the web viewer/engine/design engine area.  Need to define a URI for files/resources in a JSR 170 repository so that report engine can open report designsm report doc in it, load resources in it, and/or generate report doc in it.
Wenfeng's interpretation in comment #3 is a separate feature.  I think that the description and comment #1 are more accurate.  I think he wants to run a query against a JSR-170 repository and then be able to use the metadata and content in a report.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In the project explorer only, double click on a .java file usually opens the file in an editor. Frequently, this doesn't work. Whether double click to open works or not seems to be determined when starting the IDE (launching eclipse.exe). Once the IDE is started double click will either work or not work for that session, the behaviour remaining unchanged until the IDE is closed and restarted.

When double click to open a .java file in the project explorer is not working:
a) double click still works in the package explorer
b) in project explorer, a .java can still be opened using the right click context menu
c) double click still causes the section associated with the .java to be expanded or collapsed.

When double click to open a .java file is working, the file is both opened AND the section is expanded or collapsed. This is different to the package explorer where double click only opens the file and doesn't change the expaned/collapsed status of the section.

When restarting the IDE, it seems that double click fails more often if there are several editor windows left open, and works more often if all editor windows are closed.
Sorry, first line should have read something like:

Re: JBOSS 3.2.7 Integration with WTP1.x
The bug is that v3.2.x should be renamed to 3.2.3, because JBoss 3.2.7 needs
different server definition files.

So Eclipse only supports up to 3.2.3 and not 3.2.x.

In fact after updating to wtp 1.0.1 my JBoss 3.2.7 server was gone (again),
till I reconfigured the server definition files.

Attached are my server definition files. Copy them into your
eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.jst.server.generic.serverdefinitions diretory
after you made a backup of your old files.

Hope this helps.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; Trying to the nightly build to get updated server definitions, every thing
&gt; works fine for jboss config until i get an error :
&gt;
&gt; If i go to the eclipse workbench and select file | new | other | server |
&gt; next i can see 2 entries for JBOSS which are the v3.2.x one and the v4.0.
&gt;
&gt; Chosing the first option i get the error :
&gt;
&gt; Missing classpath entry
&gt; D:\jboss-3.2.7\server\default\lib\javax.servlet.jar
&gt;
&gt; Then when i provide one i get the the error :
&gt;
&gt; Missing classpath entry D:\jboss-3.2.7\server\default\lib\jboss-boot.jar
&gt;
&gt; What is this last one ? and where can i get it as it does come with jboss
&gt; 3.2.x installs !
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be great.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;

Naci, this is a report about the problem I have told you about earlier. I guess you may want to revert the labels back to 3.2.3

    <WithStack>I've written a tool that monitors build process (handles email notifications, may parse rss feeds) and shows build status in system tray (icon is added for each build type; green led means build is ok, red means failed). It's written in java and uses swt to provide ui.

Currently I've placed it in technology/org.eclipse.gmf/devtools/org.eclipse.releng.builder.tray but I'd like to contribute it to releng project so others could notice and use it.
Hi Dave, 

This isn't really a releng project per say but rather bucket for the platform releng builds. If you want to contribute something to a common releng project, I would suggest contact Nick Boldt of EMF who is working on a common build infrastructure for the modeling projects.
Sorry, my previous message should have said, Hi Dmitry.  Looking a multiple bugs at once :-)</WithStack>

I currently moved to a new PC which had different drive letters. I start up one Eclipse instance, and then in there run a second instance under the debugger. In the launch configuration I still had the old path name to my workspace, like "D:\workspace". But that's not right anymore (everything is on C:). So when I tried to launch the second instance (Run &gt; Debug...) I got an error dialog, but the message was misleading. It said:

"Workspace Cannot be Locked
Could not launch the product because the associated workspace is currently in use."

It's not in use, it's completely missing. Also it would be nice for it to tell me what workspace directory it was complaining about since I have several.
this message comes from the IDE.
The "Workspace in use" is generally unfriendly and could be improved to give the user more info about how to resolve the problem including a hint that there may be another instance of Eclipse running.
Created attachment 47014
org.eclipse.ui.ide patch
Fixed by distinguishing between two possible failures to launch:
1. workspace exists and is already in use
2. directory cannot be created 

Also fixed up the messages to make the wording consistent.

Boris, please review/release.  Thanks.
Patch released to HEAD &gt;20060730. Thanks Wassim!</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hello,

I have a report where I set a background color (light green) in the 
masterpage.
In PDF output the background color is ok, shared all over the page.
But in HTML format there appears a white border (left side, top side, right 
side) and in the bottom a big white area.
(see attachment birt.jpg)

How can I achieve that the whole webbpage appears in light green (like in PDF output) without any whiteborder?

I tried also to use the predefined CSS style 'report', and the background-color attribute. But it seems to have no effect neither.

Furter investigations have shown me, that te predefined CSS-style 'report' leads into a style_0 in the reports HTML source.
So I did furter tests:

If I change e.g. the 'font-familiy' format within the 'report' style then I see an immediate effect on the font-family format within style_0 of the source of the HTML page.
But if I change the 'background-color' format within the 'report' style and preview my report, nothing happens.
If I look into the HTML source again, I expect to see a 'background-color:' format within style_0, but it is'nt there!?!
Why it is not there?

So how can I get rid of this white border arround my chart?

1. I tried using the masterpage backgound color --&gt; no effect
2. I tried to use the predefined 'report' style, background-color --&gt; does not appear in style_0, and so it has no effect on the page neither

So any ideas?
Created attachment 36060
HTML result within browser (IE), with the white border
This border is caused by the js code. JS currently tries to put page content from engine into a div created in the viewing time to make sure the master page content can be completely shown in the browser window without being blocked by a vertical scroll bar.

We could remove it if this cause user big problem.

Hello Jun Zhai,

the div is not the problem, the content can appear in a div! the superior element (body) and its CSS style_0 is the problem.
An easy way to solve this problem is I already mentioned in my post:

Modifications of the predefined CSS style 'report' lead into modifications in style_0 of the HTML source of the report. (correct me if I am wrong)

I saved the HTML source of the report into a file and added background-color: #FF0000 manually to the style_0 within the HTML source, then the border disappears. So style_0 is the right place to act on, because id morifies the body tag of the HTML page. The problem is, in the chart wizard I can modify the CSS style 'report' (which is style_0 in the result page) but only on font style. If I modify the font, it changes accordingly in the style_0. But for the backround style it does not! 
In the style_0 no background-color: appears even if I set it under the chart wizard! This is the problem!
So just make the chart wizard overtaking all changes in the predifiend CSS style 'reports' into the style_0 of the report result, thats it!

See attachment birt1.jpg, there you can see the result of changes on the 'Font' style has an effect on style_0

See attachment birt2.jpg, there you can see, same wizard same style ('report'), changes in the 'Background' style has no effect on style_0, no backround-color: is there!!!



Created attachment 36230
CSS style 'reports': Modification of Font style has effect on style_0
Created attachment 36231
CSS style 'reports': Modification of Backround style has NO effect on style_0!!!
please evaluate the suggested solution from T.M.  if it can not be done in 2.1.0, please schedule to 2.1.1.
Hello Wenfeng Li,

Hello Wei Yan,

I am back to BIRT now (using version 2.1.2), after a while working on other projects.
Now I wanted to create a new report, but I still have this border problem.
You said it is fixed already. May you can explain where I can change the settings to get rid of this white border?

Thanks a lot!

Hello? Nobody out there???

*** Bug 168827 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The white border user seen is the default margin of the body.
In html the body has a default margin. We should remove it.

I have fix it in the preview modle in both BIRT 2.1.3 and 2.2.
Viewer team will fix it in the run &amp; frameset model.

Remove the padding value for DIV container when use run &amp; frameset servlet pattern.
Hello,

maybe one of you (Jerry Cheng or Liang Yu) can explain me, what your comments mean? Do I get you right that it will be fixed in version 2.1.3?

Why Wei Yan (on 2006-06-17 20:53:50) wrote it is fixed, if it is not?

If it will be fixed in 2.1.3 do I have to change some settings in the reports to make the border disappear or is it set to no more visible by default?

Thanks for further information!

Hi, burns:

This bug has been fixed in BIRT 2.1.3 and 2.2 on 2007-04-18.

You can download current version BIRT 2.1.3 and open your report without changing any setting. The white border should disappear.

Thanks.
(In reply to comment #17)

Where can I download the version 2.1.3? I can only find 2.1.2 and 2.2M6.

Can you provide a link to a version where this problem is solved?

Thanks a lot!
BIRT 2.1.3 isn't released yet. You can check it using the Nightly build. 
For example the following link:

http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/build.php?build=N-R1-2.1.3-N20070426-200704260600

Also you can open the recent build page.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Hello,

I have a report where I set a background color (light green) in the 
masterpage.
In PDF output the background color is ok, shared all over the page.
But in HTML format there appears a white border (left side, top side, right 
side) and in the bottom a big white area.
(see attachment birt.jpg)

How can I achieve that the whole webbpage appears in light green (like in PDF output) without any whiteborder?

I tried also to use the predefined CSS style 'report', and the background-color attribute. But it seems to have no effect neither.

I hit a similar error when trying to Create an XDocket EJB within a new EJB project.
This should be fixed in any build after Eclipse 3.2 0413. I doubt this will make it into 3.2RC1, but it should be available in 3.2RC2.
Fixed by platform for WTP 1.5 RC2.

    <WithStack>I have two content types that are defined in two different plugins as follows:

In PluginA:
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.core.runtime.contentTypes"&gt;
	&lt;content-type
       base-type="org.eclipse.core.runtime.text"
       file-extensions="ss,s,inc"
       id="contentTypeA"
       name="%name"
       priority="high"&gt;
 &lt;/content-type&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

PluginB:
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.core.runtime.contentTypes"&gt;
	&lt;content-type
       base-type="org.eclipse.core.runtime.text"
       file-extensions="ss,s,inc"
       id="contentTypeB"
       name="%name"
       priority="high"&gt;
 &lt;/content-type&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

Now, I bind these content types to two different natures like so:

In PluginA:
&lt;extension
     id="ProjectNatureA"
     name="Project Nature A"
     point="org.eclipse.core.resources.natures"&gt;
  &lt;runtime&gt;
     &lt;run class="my.package.ProjectNatureA"/&gt;
  &lt;/runtime&gt;
  &lt;content-type id="plugin.A.contentTypeA"/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

In PluginB:
&lt;extension
     id="ProjectNatureB"
     name="Project Nature B"
     point="org.eclipse.core.resources.natures"&gt;
  &lt;runtime&gt;
     &lt;run class="my.package.ProjectNatureB"/&gt;
  &lt;/runtime&gt;
  &lt;content-type id="plugin.B.contentTypeB"/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

This all works fine when opening and editing files.  The same filename ending in ".ss" is opened by the appropriate editor based on the nature of the project.
Now, I have set up content merge viewers, and they fail to work.  It appears that it registers the content-types based on file extension only, ignoring natures, so there is only ever one content-type registered for the extension ".ss".  Thus, the wrong compare viewer is opened.  I have registered my compare viewers as follows:

In PluginA:
&lt;extension
    point="org.eclipse.compare.contentMergeViewers"&gt;
    &lt;viewer class="my.package.ContentViewerCreatorA"
            id="myContentViewerCreatorA"&gt;
    &lt;/viewer&gt;
    &lt;contentTypeBinding contentMergeViewerId="plugin.A.myContentViewerCreatorA"
          contentTypeId="plugin.A.contentTypeA"/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

In PluginB:
&lt;extension
    point="org.eclipse.compare.contentMergeViewers"&gt;
    &lt;viewer class="my.package.ContentViewerCreatorB"
            id="myContentViewerCreatorB"&gt;
    &lt;/viewer&gt;
    &lt;contentTypeBinding contentMergeViewerId="plugin.B.myContentViewerCreatorB"
          contentTypeId="plugin.B.contentTypeB"/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

I find that it is always opening the content merge viewer for plugin B.  I'm assuming it rips through all extensions and overrides the merge viewer already registered by plugin A on the ".ss" extension, with the one found for plugin B on the same extension.  Why is it being registered on the file extension anyway, and not queried at runtime with IFile.getContentDescriptor().getContentType().?
We should have a look at this for 3.3.
We didn't have time to address this in 3.3.
Mass update - removing 3.4 target. This was one of the bugs marked for
investigation (and potential fixing) in 3.4 but we ran out of time. Please ping
on the bug if fixing it would be really important for 3.4, and does not require
API changes or feature work.
You're now able to switch to a different content merge viewer if the default one doesn't fit you.

public class C implements I {

Select the "value" field, and run the "Pull Up" refactoring.  Select "I" as the destination of the refactoring.  No warnings are presented, but of course a non-final field doesn't make sense in an interface.  After the refactoring there is a compile error in "I".  The refactoring shouldn't allow  non-final fields to be pulled up (or at least warn against it).

    <WithStack>When two instances of a Perfmon Agent are launched and terminated one after the other, the second agent to be terminated does not seem to terminate correctly. The process terminates, but the profiling monitor does not refresh correctly (instead of the agent appearing terminated, it continues to appear as though it is being monitored).

This seems to be due to the agent proxy continuing to have an active state set to true (and not to false as it should be once it is terminated).

I've traced the issue to what I think is the 
TRCAgentProxy agentProxy = PDCoreUtil.getCorrespondingAgent(fProcess,ag,true);

call in org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.internal.piclient.PIProcessListener:250 in the agentInactive(Agent a) method. The getCorrespondingAgent method returns null for the erroneous agent, with 

agentProxy.getRuntimeId() == ag.getUUID() (PDCoreUtil.java: 307)

resolving to false incorrectly. Since RuntimeId and UUID are both strings, it appears as though this should be an object comparison (.equals()) instead. 

I have not been able to figure out why the first agent launched matches with the == statement, and the second does not.
Hi George, are you running the two agent under the same process tree? Can you verify if the process and the listener being invoked is the correct one? 
Hey Eugene,

The two agents are under separate process trees. I've debugged the getCorrespondingAgent method to show what I'm seeing.

There are two agents running, under different processes. When I terminate the first, the output looks as follows:

Searcing for corresponding agent in TRCProcessProxy (name=Windows System, pid=2508)
Searching for agent with UUID of 82cf46d2-4497-4b15-af08-f3783526b1ec (hashcode=-1973141163)

Comparing PerfmonAgent to PerfmonAgent ... true
Comparing runtime IDs agentProxy.getRuntimeId()=82cf46d2-4497-4b15-af08-f3783526b1ec ag.getUUID()=82cf46d2-4497-4b15-af08-f3783526b1ec ... true

So, a match was found since the agentProxy.getRuntimeId() and ag.getUUID() matched.

When I try and terminate the second agent, it all seems correct except that there is no strict match.

Searcing for corresponding agent in TRCProcessProxy (name=Windows System, pid=3212)
Searching for agent with UUID of d31e432f-4a7d-4a5a-bcad-32a620028882 (hashcode=257780671)

Comparing PerfmonAgent to PerfmonAgent ... true
Comparing runtime IDs agentProxy.getRuntimeId()=d31e432f-4a7d-4a5a-bcad-32a620028882 ag.getUUID()=d31e432f-4a7d-4a5a-bcad-32a620028882 ... false

Even though the IDs are exact there is no match since they are not stored in the same string (ie, this is not a content comparison).

The process is the correct one (the process is actually terminated) and the PIProcessListeners seem to be correct as well (that is, they reference the correct agent).

    <WithOutStack>When two instances of a Perfmon Agent are launched and terminated one after the other, the second agent to be terminated does not seem to terminate correctly. The process terminates, but the profiling monitor does not refresh correctly (instead of the agent appearing terminated, it continues to appear as though it is being monitored).

This seems to be due to the agent proxy continuing to have an active state set to true (and not to false as it should be once it is terminated).

I've traced the issue to what I think is the 
TRCAgentProxy agentProxy = PDCoreUtil.getCorrespondingAgent(fProcess,ag,true);

call in org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.internal.piclient.PIProcessListener:250 in the agentInactive(Agent a) method. The getCorrespondingAgent method returns null for the erroneous agent, with 

agentProxy.getRuntimeId() == ag.getUUID() (PDCoreUtil.java: 307)

resolving to false incorrectly. Since RuntimeId and UUID are both strings, it appears as though this should be an object comparison (.equals()) instead. 

I have not been able to figure out why the first agent launched matches with the == statement, and the second does not.
Hi George, are you running the two agent under the same process tree? Can you verify if the process and the listener being invoked is the correct one? 
Hey Eugene,

The two agents are under separate process trees. I've debugged the getCorrespondingAgent method to show what I'm seeing.

There are two agents running, under different processes. When I terminate the first, the output looks as follows:

Searcing for corresponding agent in TRCProcessProxy (name=Windows System, pid=2508)
Searching for agent with UUID of 82cf46d2-4497-4b15-af08-f3783526b1ec (hashcode=-1973141163)

Comparing PerfmonAgent to PerfmonAgent ... true
Comparing runtime IDs agentProxy.getRuntimeId()=82cf46d2-4497-4b15-af08-f3783526b1ec ag.getUUID()=82cf46d2-4497-4b15-af08-f3783526b1ec ... true

So, a match was found since the agentProxy.getRuntimeId() and ag.getUUID() matched.

When I try and terminate the second agent, it all seems correct except that there is no strict match.

Searcing for corresponding agent in TRCProcessProxy (name=Windows System, pid=3212)
Searching for agent with UUID of d31e432f-4a7d-4a5a-bcad-32a620028882 (hashcode=257780671)

Comparing PerfmonAgent to PerfmonAgent ... true
Comparing runtime IDs agentProxy.getRuntimeId()=d31e432f-4a7d-4a5a-bcad-32a620028882 ag.getUUID()=d31e432f-4a7d-4a5a-bcad-32a620028882 ... false

Even though the IDs are exact there is no match since they are not stored in the same string (ie, this is not a content comparison).

The process is the correct one (the process is actually terminated) and the PIProcessListeners seem to be correct as well (that is, they reference the correct agent).

Hubert, Randy
  Let me know the effort estimate. I will send an invite to discuss this next week (March 13-06).
Thanks,
Guru
Moving to I3 as code contribution to JVMTI component is pending EMO legal approval.
We're close to integrating these into the builds. However, there are still things to do with packaging, building with what we have available to us in the build process, etc. Will be checking in fixed makefiles that are at least syntactically correct right away, but there is still more to do.
Checking in 6 configure-environment.jvmti.sf files for the Windows|Linux X IA32|IPF|EM64T native platforms. Setting JAVA_HOME using BEA's JRockit for Java 5 and including $JAVA_HOME/bin in the path.
Retargeting for completion in i4.
configure-environment.jvmti.sf files for Windows|Linux X IA32|IPF|EM64T, and add necessary features to build_ia.sh in releng/master/bash. Build after agntctrl built, and push out agntctrl.sdk for each platform prior to build. Note that since jvmti depends on probekit sources, we can't just push jvmti.runtime package, but have to push the whole tptp.nativecode to get both packages. Overkill, but necessary if we can't change the structure of the jvmti build.

Created attachment 36070
Initial simple implementation of the fix for subj

The patch assumes that there are empty org.eclipse.gmf.codegen.reconciler and org.eclipse.gmf.codegen.reconciler.test.taipan plugins already created somewhere
Attributes mostly often modified by user (like plugin id, provider name, ...) should be preserved. 

Comment on attachment 36070
Initial simple implementation of the fix for subj

Proposed patch provides base extensible reconciler service. However, in the current service implementation, only small subset of features are supported. 
It will be extended in future
Created attachment 36071
Fixed: reconciler fails to load old gmfgen resource when invoked from UI
There are attributes in gmfgen that are not set during transformation step and get their values from handcoded implementation. It's easy to detect user changes for such attributes, hence the patch.

Next attributes were identified as suitable for reconciling:
Copyright text
Package prefix
Diagram file extension
Same diagram/model file attribute
Plugin provider name
Plugin version

Please reopen scr to add more.
refactored into oeg.common/oeg.internal.common.reconcile package.

It would be nice if the compiler could issue a warning or error in these cases where the human eye reads a statement as part of the previous loop or condition.

I am not sure iff this counts as an eclipse problem, or if PMD is at fault.
It's a bug in PMDPlugin.  THe API being called, IResource.setPersistentProperty, is spec'd to say the property should be under 2KB in length.  That's the restriction that is being hit in this stack trace.  I suggest reporting the bug to the maintainer of that plugin.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The column annotation is not removed when setting the column back to the default selection through the UI.  

Another removal issue involves OrderBy, where currently the annotation cannot be removed once it is added.  In this case the annotation can stand alone, or not be used at all.  For this case a check-box would likely be needed to determine if the user wants the annotation in the source or not.

Annotation removal needs to be reviewed across the plug-in.
The first item in this bug appears to be resolved.
Was fixed in 0.5, not really valid for 1.0.
Closing as fixed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When using the Generic Recording Framework , and you specify you want to create a test from existing recording you get the error seen below.  This worked in 4.1.  It might be related to changing the Test.UI plugin from a plugin directory to a jar.

    <WithOutStack>When using the Generic Recording Framework , and you specify you want to create a test from existing recording you get the error seen below.  This worked in 4.1.  It might be related to changing the Test.UI plugin from a plugin directory to a jar.

    <WithStack>I'm wanting to write a DOM that has access to the JavaScript packages; to do this right, eclipsemonkey should re-export these packages.  Or perhaps better, it should split the javascript packages off into a separate javascript bundle.
We're not sure why you want this - could you explain the problem you are trying to solve?
I have a DOM implementation which itself is invoking some JavaScript code.  And potentially (probably) returning JavaScript objects through the DOM back into the .em script.

To make this work right, it really needs to be using the SAME instance of the JavaScript runtime as Eclipse Monkey.  If I use my own Javascript library, I get class loading issues (as would be expected).

I don't think there's a way around having "org.mozilla.javascript" added to the "Export-Package" entry of "org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey".  I thought perhaps I could create a fragment of your plugin which re-exported the package, but that doesn't appear to work.
I posted some info on my blog about what I was trying to do:

   http://pmuellr.blogspot.com/2006/03/more-eclipse-monkeying.html
Created attachment 36262
JavaScript plug in

This plug-in contains the Rhino JavaScript implementation. All packages are exported.
Created attachment 36263
Patch for org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey to refactor out JavaScript library.
I've got a slightly different use-case which requires the same fix. I've been writing a few test DOMs and wanted to pass a javascript object as a parameter object (useful for optional arguments), e.g. 
  
  var params = {title: "hello", title: "world"};
  // equivalent to: params = new Object(); params.title="hello"; etc...
  myDom.display(params);

To enable this to work my dom needs to have a method signature similar to:

  public void display(ScriptableObject params) 

Unfortunately I can't do this because ScriptableObject has not been re-exported.  This means I have no way to access the slots of the js prototype object. 

I've verified that the proposed fix will work, though I only need the package:
"org.mozilla.javascript" at present.
If you look at Wayne's comments and the attachments, you might guess that the way the situation was going to be fixed was to break Rhino into a separate plugin that eclipsemonkey and whomever else wanted, could pre-req.  That's the story I heard a few weeks ago anyway.

Should work for me, and should work for Dave also.
Patch sort of applied (I changed the name of the plugin to org.mozilla.rhino instead of .javascript).

    <WithStack>In order to make the user aware of incoming changes to Bugzilla items in their task list, a Bugzilla change notification should appear in the mylar notification dialog. This notification should contain the identity of the bug and the change that has taken place. Space is limited so the layout/format of this information is critical.

As part of this report, improvements must be made to the synchronization mechanism to reduce CPU load. Suggested starting points: reducing the priority of the scheduled synchronization jobs, don't synchronize tasks that already have incoming status (they will get synchronized when the user opens them anyway).

Related bugs: bug#124908
Why would you do that? I think it would be more consistent with Eclipse proress visualization if you just leave jobs on progress view and provide hyperlink to task list. E.g. see cvs synchroization...
The intention here is to minimize reliance on email by providing a non-intrusive notification. Notification will only occur if a change in the report occurs (not a notification for every synchronization).  Then, if the user finds the notification interesting, they can click on it and the related issue is displayed, just like reminder notifications currently work. Does this answer your question or have I misunderstood?
Rob, this is another one we need to round out the functionality and should be easy to add at this point.

          <Line>E.g, create abstract class GMFFeatureChecker with 5+ implementation classes that know, say, that feature Color should be checked via some Color-specific way different from the check for, say Dimension features.

          <Line>So, I am in in trouble. In addition, I do not see a lot of code duplication there. The only common features that are checked by more than 1 FigureCheck is a children.size().

    <WithStack>Generate plug-in with figures, instantiate generated classes and compare their structure and runtime properties to those specified in .gmfgraph model
Created attachment 36812
Contains subj tests as well as fixes required to make them pass.
1. manifest.mfjet - activator needs singleton=true option?
2. Is there a real need in getFigureXCheck? Smells like code duplication, and what's really being checked is that code in figureXCheck() is aligned with code in figureX(). Can't it be done in bit more generic way? With graphdef.Figure instance you've got all the information you need to actually check IFigure instance.
3. Custom Figures as part of oeg.tests plug-in. Again, what's the need for that? What if we just generate these figures into separate plugin first, and then reference them from that plugin?

1. It does not NEED this. However it seems that all of our plugis has this flag. 
2. It is TESTS code. I see a lot of other ways to implement this. 
E.g, create abstract class GMFFeatureChecker with 5+ implementation classes that know, say, that feature Color should be checked via some Color-specific way different from the check for, say Dimension features. Then I may create one more separate registry class which will map feature name into checker and traverse gmf-EOBject reflectively while checking generated instances against feature values. 
OR 

I may use new and exciting generative approach and generate tests using 5+ per-feature templates and 2 classes that compose them together. 

But, I am absolutely sure that in this case someone will mind that we really need 7 new classes/templates (which we will have to maintain, _test_, etc) just to implement simple checks that may be done by just 4 simple methods. 

So, I am in in trouble. In addition, I do not see a lot of code duplication there. The only common features that are checked by more than 1 FigureCheck is a children.size(). I doubt that we want to traverse ALL OF OTHER OF OUR TESTS and extract the code which checks the size of collection into separate helper code. Could you please point me to code duplication except this one?

3. We want to check that custom figures (that are just a peaces of legacy user code) may be used. This use casediffers from the one suggested (also we need to test the suggested use case, but it is the part of another scr) Please consider these 2 classes as just a legacy code. 
1. There should be REASON not to have singleton. All other plug-in has singleton=true for reason, not because it's just a 'fancy' thing
2. Code duplication is in figureX() and checkFigureX() methods. Latter relies on the code in the former. If you change figureX, you have to change checkFigureX. If you are unlucky, and checkFigureX was not updated but didn't failed, you won't ever notice the problem. That's why it's benefitial to have 'veryfy' login independent from the code under check
3. What't the problem treating classes just generated as part of previous test as 'legacy' code. What's the point to have them coded (provided we trust our generated code - we do check it with our tests, right?)

This doesn't seem to be a problem for .tar files.
I think this is happening because the zip file is cached in the import structure provider.  The zip file remained open after the import was fininshed but as a result of fixing bug 115360, the zip file is now closed.

    <WithStack>File writing is not thread safe in the org.eclipse.hyades.logging.core plug-in.

There are several instances in the org.eclipse.hyades.logging.core plug-in where file writing is not thread safe.  These instances should be corrected (e.g. file locking) if the negative performance impact can be absorbed, new thread safe APIs created or the lack of threading issue well documented in the current APIs.
Transitioning to new component owner (Cindy Jin).
Cannot contain in TPTP V4.3(i3)
This is required from AC perspective.
In TPTP 4.3, some of the classes in org.eclipse.hyades.logging.core were moved to a new plugin called org.eclipse.tptp.platform.logging.events.  Therefore, I believe this bugzilla affects the following classes and methods:

In org.eclipse.hyades.logging.core plugin:
The File versions of 
org.eclipse.hyades.logging.core.XMLUtility.serialize
org.eclipse.hyades.logging.core.XMLUtility.deserialize

All my menu shortcuts disappear sometimes and shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+T (open type) stop working

It may be a dup of bug 126162, not sure
This is due to debian patches against 2.6.4.  See bug 111514.
bug 111514 seems to lack a clear recommendation for what we should do

Will upgrading our gtk+ make it go away?
please advise.
Upgrading to a Debian GTK+ 2.6.8 or later should fix the problem, as would switching to any gnome.org GTK+.

We won't fix this.  Shame on you Debian.</WithStack>

This attachment does something similar.  (Hopefully the .gif wont't be corrupted; I couldn't pull it from your patch.)
Ed,

Yes, the gif is corrupted too!
In general your patch seems to work. From looking at the code, I had the feeling that it acts as a fallback solution when the generated gifs are not found (some Exception occurs). But when testing it, it works for all images - even if the generated gifs are present. No problem for me, but...

Your approach has the advantage that it is simpler and that it works for all editors.

My proposal has the advantage that it offers a general possibility to compute arbitrary images on the fly. I don't need this feature.

After all I'd be happy if either one of both approaches makes it to HEAD ;-)

One last question: Your generated image is not cached, too?

That's not true!
It doesn't find the gifs in derived models and thatwas one of the reasons to make this patch ;-)
Ed,

I fear there is another issue with your approach: How can I disable generation of only the CreateChild images?
Eike,

Sorry, I wasn't on the CC list so I didn't notice all these appends.  

Creating the factory used by the editor like this:

  new ComposedAdapterFactory(ComposedAdapterFactory.Registry.INSTANCE)

should automatically find each registered adapter factory appropriate for a particular model.

The concern about not generarting the child icons seems orthogonal and is the same concern with either approach.  Doesn't GenModel Edit property "Creation Icons" address this?

Yes, I know that and many of my editors work with that.

 
&gt; The concern about not generarting the child icons seems orthogonal and is the
&gt; same concern with either approach.

If I remember correctly, my solution first tried to get the image through the new adapter and only if that results in null the generated icons are loaded. Anyway, if we go your way, that doesn't matter.


&gt; Doesn't GenModel Edit property "Creation Icons" address this?

Sounds like it ;-)
Didn't know that.

From my perspective we're ok then. Do you think the default for "Creation Icons" should be changed to false?
The changes are committed to CVS.
Fixed in EMF 2.2.0M6.
Folks, I love this feature, but either I'm doing something wrong or this isn't working very seemlessly. With the following use case:

I have custom icons in full/obj16. In .genmodel, "Image" is set to true for each. I want generated "Create" icons based on these custom icons.

The only way I have found to make this work (absent custom code) is to have genmodel "Creation Icons" set to true, generate model, and then delete the icons that are created in ctool16 -- these are based off of default "star cluster" icons. If I follow these steps it seems that icons are created dynamically, but it is a bit tedious and non-obvious. [Actually I have created an ant script for it, but as the target for this feautre is enabling nice interfaces out of the box..]
Miles,

That boolean value affects only two things:  whether the icons are created in the ctools folder, and whether there is a generated override of getCreateChildImage.  The former should be the same as manually deleting, and the later should ensure that the ItemProviderAdapter method is called, which does the overlaying.  So I think this should be working properly.  Maybe there are some issues with the cached configuration still containing the old images?
OK. Let me relate what is happening and ask wether it is expected behavior? 

When "Creation Icons" is set to false, no icons are created and a getCreateChildImage method is generated for ..ItemProviders. In the editor, the Creation icons are same unmodified icons as the domain icons.

When "" set to true, icons are generated in ctool16, but they are composed of default icons, not my custom icons. In the editor, these icons appear as these default+create icons.

If I then delete the ctool16 icons, I get custom+create icons as desired.

If this isn't expected, I'll investigate configuration issue, but I am doing a "-clean" for runtime.
Move to verified as per bug 206558.</WithStack>

See bug 131373.
The corresponding compilerarg nested element should set up its compiler name in order to prevent javac from being called with this option that it doesn't support.
Doing this would remove a hack from the ant adapter.
We need to synchronize our changes.

    <WithStack>By default, the update manager currently (3.2M5) offers to install a new add-in feature directly in the Eclipse installation directory. You can change it but most naive users will accept the default. This is NOT a best practice because if you have to re-install Eclipse then you lose the features and plug-ins. This has frustrated many a new Eclipse user.

This is a request to change the default extension location used by the update manager. For example if Eclipse is installed into "C:\Program Files\Eclipse" then suggest a different place, for example "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Extensions" or maybe "C:\Documents and Settings\userid\Eclipse Extensions". 

On Unix, if the install directory is "/usr/local/lib/eclipse" then the extension location could be "/usr/local/lib/eclipse-extensions" or perhaps "~/eclipse-extensions". 

I don't care too much where you default it as long as it's NOT in the main Eclipse install tree. In fact if the user tries to install a plug-in in the main Eclipse installation directory I would like to see a warning dialog come up telling them it's not a good idea because it will be lost if Eclipse is reinstalled.
All for this function - +1.
This topic was touched on in the 2nd comment in bug 106185.  The goal there was to allow a product to somehow control where new extensions get added by the update manager.

The net of that discussion led some tool/private domains to use a placeholder feature and the required use of the colocation-affinity attribute in additional features; this is not all joy as it still allows the eclipse root dir to be the default and that causes problems long term.

    <WithOutStack>By default, the update manager currently (3.2M5) offers to install a new add-in feature directly in the Eclipse installation directory. You can change it but most naive users will accept the default. This is NOT a best practice because if you have to re-install Eclipse then you lose the features and plug-ins. This has frustrated many a new Eclipse user.

This is a request to change the default extension location used by the update manager. For example if Eclipse is installed into "C:\Program Files\Eclipse" then suggest a different place, for example "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Extensions" or maybe "C:\Documents and Settings\userid\Eclipse Extensions". 

On Unix, if the install directory is "/usr/local/lib/eclipse" then the extension location could be "/usr/local/lib/eclipse-extensions" or perhaps "~/eclipse-extensions". 

I don't care too much where you default it as long as it's NOT in the main Eclipse install tree. In fact if the user tries to install a plug-in in the main Eclipse installation directory I would like to see a warning dialog come up telling them it's not a good idea because it will be lost if Eclipse is reinstalled.
All for this function - +1.
This topic was touched on in the 2nd comment in bug 106185.  The goal there was to allow a product to somehow control where new extensions get added by the update manager.

    <WithStack>Related to bug 126649 which involves removing update.configurator's dependancy on the runtime.

We would like to add support for another key in the config.ini which contains a list of bundle symbolic names. The update configurator will process this list and if it happens to install a bundle on the list, then it will start it.

I will work on this and attach a patch to this report.

patch for update.configurator

Patch for the update.configurator project.

Added property "eclipse.eagerStart" to the config.ini file. Value is a comma-separated list of bundle symbolic names to agressively start.

I applied the patch for this bug as well as the patch for bug 126649, modified my config.ini so it only had update.configurator and common on the osgi.bundles list, added org.eclipse.core.runtime to the eclipse.eagerStart list, and the workbench started ok.

Note that I also had to set Eclipse-Lazystart:true for the registry plug-in but I think this is what we want, right?
ok, this isn't working for me anymore. I will update the patch once I figured out what I messed up. :-)

John, what are your thoughts on making the jobs bundle lazy-start? Are there problems with this?
The org.eclipse.core.runtime bundle does not handle when things it depends on are not started.  In the current osgi.bundles list we make sure org.eclipse.core.jobs and org.eclipse.equinox.registry are started before org.eclipse.core.runtime is started.  This is done by having core.jobs and equinox.registry startlevels at 2 and core.runtime's startlevel at 3.

If we stick all three of these bundles (core.jobs, equinox.registry and core.runtime) on the "aggressive start" list then they will all endup with the same startlevel.  The OSGi spec states that if bundles are at the same startlevel then they will be started by install order.  Update configurator will install these bundles in alphabetical order.  So they will be started in the following order

org.eclipse.core.jobs
org.eclipse.core.runtime
org.eclipse.equinox.registry

This order is problematic because runtime does not start successfully (gets NPEs) when the registry is not available.  Given that we have almost no time left I suggest we make core.jobs and equinox.registry lazy start.

I think this is the desired behavior for both bundles because their API will not function correctly unless they are started.  You may argue that jobs does not really require being started, but if it is not started then it will fail to log properly (requires PackageAdmin service) and it will not execute any shutdown code when the platform is shutdown.  

One issue may be that jobs will be shutdown at a different time.  Currently it is at startlevel 2 which causes it to be one of the last bundles to stop.  If it is lazy started and it is at the same startlevel as the rest of the bundles then it will be stopped according to dependency order.  This should cause it to be stopped after all bundles which depend on it are stopped.  I think this is desired behavior but it is a change from before where we ensured jobs was stopped last because of startlevel.
We are going to look at doing a couple of things:

- make jobs and registry lazy-start
- persisting the state so we know whether or not a bundle was started lazily or by someone calling its #start method. So next time we start up, we can start up the bundles that were explicitly started.

This has been deferred to post-3.2.

    <WithStack>JET attempts to strip whitespace around tags, but the current implementation yeilds inconsistent results.

A better solution includes:

1) defines whitespace stripping as the removal of leading and trailing whitespace (including the trailing new-line) from a tag that is alone on a line.

2) allow tag declarations to include an attribute indicating whether whitespace stripping should occur. In general, tags that do not write content to the should enable white space stripping, while others should not.

Also, consider the possibility of escaping a new-line, and of normalizing (in the XML sense) content. The use-case for this is something like:

&lt;c:set select="..." name="getterSignature"&gt;
    &lt;c:get select=".../@getterName"/&gt;(
    &lt;c:iterate ".../arg" var="arg" delimiter=", "&gt;
       &lt;c:get select="$arg/@type"/&gt; &lt;c:get select="$arg/@name&gt;
    &lt;/c:iterate&gt;
&lt;/c:set&gt;

Currently, this must be squished into a single, very long line of code, but the above is much more readable.
Changes committed to CVS.
Fixed in build 1.0.0 I200603231121.

    <WithStack>Eclipse 3.2 M4 with 1.5 JRE

Did a code completion on Collections.s
Got Collections.emptyList(). Which is 1.5 specific. Broke head for 1.4 users.
Correct version was Collections.EMPTY_LIST

Is there a workaround? Or do you just guarantee bytecode is 1.4 but can't do anything but the java class libraries themselves?

Thanks,
Chris
&gt; Did a code completion on Collections.s
typo. I meant 'Did a code completion on Collections.e'
If you put 1.5 classlibs on your classpath, then you get completions which maybe 1.5 specific. We are not excluding 1.5 specific constructs, simply because we don't really know what level they are.

In 1.4 target mode, we issue 1.4 classfiles, which are guaranteed to use any 1.5 constructs in their sources, but if you compiled them against 1.5 libs,  then you might have 1.5 binary dependencies from thereon.

So though you produced 1.4 classfiles, they will need a 1.5 JRE to be executed, due to the dependencies you did introduce. 

Best for 1.4 compliance to use 1.4 libs on your classpath, unless you like to live dangerously.

Closing as invalid.
I think this is a serious usability problem. I just did the same thing and almost borke a nightly build, if Kevin had not stayed late that night and caught it we would have been broken for several days (Cheers Kev).

org.eclipse.ui.ide has it's compiler compliance set to 1.4. I am using a 1.6 VM. I accidentally used some 1.6 API and released it to the ide plug-in.

We should at least have a warning marker generated that I am using API that is not compatible with the compliance level of our code - there is no way a user is going to figure this out on their own.
Probably would require a custom JRE version checking tool that knows about the official public API's and their JRE requirement. That's some work...

You might start by properly settings your installed JRE. You installed a JRE1.4 and you set it as an exact match. It should be picked up as the JRE of your project.
Darin - can't execution environment help us here ? I would expect some access rules to kick in in such a scenario ?
The access rules for execution environments only go to the class level - not methods within classes. If access rules supported finer granularity, we could potentially expand the rules.
Would it make sense to introduce a stricter mode for the compiler where the compiler tests that the classfile compatibility of the used JARs is not higher than the configured source/classfile compliance?
Genereate an error: 'Trying to compiler 1.4 source against a 1.5 library'.
There would be a problem then in mixing plug-ins. For instance I am using Eclipse but developing another plug-in with 1.5 compliance so I would get errors if there were a mix of compliance levels in my setup.

However an error that flags me using an API with a higher than specified compliance level would be ideal.
Re: comment 8
There is already a build preferences for checking incompatible required libraries.
Re: comment 9
Once API tooling defines a set of rules, we should leverage these as (finer-grain) access rules, or something along these lines; for JDT users to see leveraged as they code.
Given option already exist as per comment 10, and API tooling is around the corner to go after such issues, I don't think we should invest more in compiler support.

Right now, the real answer is to make sure to have the proper level of libs on your classpath (and to detect inconsistencies, enable the option mentioned in comment 10).

No further action planned.
Is that ok?
Philippe when you say have the proper level of libs on your classpath  do you mean only use Foundation libs? No good for us as we have a mix of compiler levels.


If you have something better on the way I agree we should just wait for this but I am not sure how to easily set up your solution so that we don't continually have this problem.
I personally have installed several JREs on my machine. Foundation 1.0, Java4, Java5 and Java6 (amongst others).
Given this, with required execution environments properly set on my projects, each of them is picking the right flavor at compile time (through JREContainer resolution).

This guarantees that each project is compiled against the right library.

As you observed indeed, there is no one JRE to rule them all...
Would it make sense to set the 'incompatible required libraries' to 'warning' by default?
I would be happy to set to error myself - this is what we would do in our project preferences. But warning is a good start
I wouldn't change its default, because of the lib packaging issue (not us, but libs causing grief).

Java4 means target 1.2 in 1.3 source mode. However, some of the standard libs are stamped as 1.4, hence from the compiler standpoint it looks like these are incompatible with the fact you want to deliver code to a 1.2 target...

Ideally, the JRE container should rule these libs out of the classpath, to ensure that you do not accidentally code against them and really mean to deliver code for 1.2 targets. In reality, not many people do code for target prior to 1.4, so the glitch is tolerable, but still the warning would be kind of proeminent.

Ideally, the JRE container should rule these libs out of the classpath, to ensure that you do not accidentally code against them and really mean to deliver code for 1.2 targets. In reality, not many people do code for target prior to 1.4, so the glitch is tolerable, but still the warning would be kind of proeminent.

    <WithStack>Test logs usually contain very large number of events. Each event has its own details information. Naturally, there need to be some ways to get to the information that's interesting to the user. Navigation, searching, filtering are all different ways to achieve this.

This task is a little more challenging to TPTP as a framework. There are some basic types of execution events from TPTP. Consuming tools can have their own types of event by extending ExecutionEvent. For each type of event, different tool can generate different types of details information and thus furture customize them. This requires the way(s) to retrieve information also be extensible. So that it can be tuned by different tools.

Lastly, the callenge lies in design for user experience. To allow users to get to the information they want, and at the same time, KISS. (Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid)

    <WithStack>I am trying to run Eclipse 3.1.2 on a MacBook Pro (Dual Core 2.0) and Os X 10.4.5.  When starting Eclipse, it immediatly crashes with an error:
   java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /Applications/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/bundles/63/1/.cp/libswt-pi-carbon-3139.jnilib

I will try to attach the entire .log file.
Created attachment 36076
Logfile produced when eclipse crashes

This log contains the error and full stack trace.
Eclipse 3.1.2 pre-dated the existence of the mactel machines. Therefore this is normal. Now the question is do we want to rebuid 3.1.2 for mactel?
If we build, what does it means to other plug-ins from the foundation?
I think that would be a very good idea.  Even when 3.2 ships there will be large sections of our user base that will continue to use 3.1 for dependency reasons alone.
(In reply to comment #3)
&gt; If we build, what does it means to other plug-ins from the foundation?
&gt; 

For one thing ... if you are talking about a "3.1.3" then we in WTP would like
to "line up" with that date. (And if you do have a 3.1.3, there might be a few
other candidates .. like the problem on 3.1 stream using underscores in
qualifier names. 

But, if you are just talking about a new fragemnnt .. a 3.1.2B .. then we in
WTP would not even re-test. 
Here I would like to keep the focus on rebuilding the existing pieces that needs to be (mostly people with native source code), see if this is possible for the actors concerned, and don't want to mix that up with 3.1.x builds.



moving to SWT since they would be the main players here.
If there is a 3.1.x, then we could consider building the libraries.  No action  for now.

    <WithStack>CPU usage seems overly high, and we probably start too many jobs (capped at 5, but this can still overload the Progress view).
Can you group individual tasks within single job at least no more then one job
per repository? So, they would be refreshed sequentially, won't clutter
progress view and will give better progress indication (e.g. like 15 out of 50
done)
Rob, your work on bug 132066 has resolved this too.

Noticed that the label in the progress indicator was truncated (with "..." in the middle), but there was still quite a bit of available space to the right.
Created attachment 36081
Screen shot
Also, notice the vertical line between the trim drag handle and the text.  Is that a legacy separator that can be removed?

I recommend just using a CLabel, which uses an ellipsis in the middle, rather than doing our own truncation.

For consistency with view and editor tabs, we should probably truncate at the end instead (although CLabel currently only truncates in the middle).  I find truncation in the middle to be highly unreadable.  That's really a separate issue than the wasted space though.


This was fixed up in 3.3.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I would like to get an answer from the Eclipse team whether this is a Eclipse bug or a HP restriction.

The client of our product is RCP. We have a test case to access Simplified Chinese(Unicode) database from a Japanese(UTF-8) client. We found that if we log into HP under Japanese UTF-8, and then access Chinese Unicode characters from our RCP client, a lot of the Chinese Unicode characters are displayed as white-spaces. In the mean time, we also got messages printed out on the HP terminal "Unicode '&lt;character unicode&gt;' not found in table databases".

I did some other investigation on HP:
1. Log into HP under S-Ch-UTF8.
2. Open HP system editor and create a few text files with S-CH contents and names.
3. Log out of HP and log back in under Ja-UTF8.
4. In HP terminal, go to the folder where the S-CH files are stored.Type "ls -la" in terminal. 
Result: 
See a lot of white-spaces in file names.
5. Open these files in HP system editor, see the same behavior as described in step 4.

Is this something that can be fixed by Eclipse? If this is a HP restriction, I would like to get some verification from the Eclipse team so we can add it to our release notes.
When you log in a specific locale the system set its font (application font, sytem font, terminal font, etc) to something that support the characters of that locale.

The font used by HP when you log in sch does not support japanese.
The application can try to fix this by setting a japanese font in the editor if it knows the content is in japanese.
Some platforms have font linking (or font fallback) to fix this kind of problem. Motif is not the case, you need to set the right font in the widget,if the default chinese font doesn't support japanese there is nothing I can do to help.

    <WithStack>The GMF CrossReferenceAdapter class deliberately ignores features that are not derived but also not changeable.  This does not seem to make sense, as the separation of isDerived from isChangeable suggests that a feature may be unchangeable but also not derived.

Ignoring derived references perhaps makes sense, because derived references are expected to be redundant with some other non-derived reference. However, the same does not hold for unchangeable references.
The filter to not include unchangeable features has been removed. The filter to remove container and containment references also has been removed. The container and containment references filter was moved into the MSLCrossReferenceAdapter in the comptability plugin. The filter behaviour of CrossReferenceAdapter is consistent with the ECrossReferenceAdapter

    <WithStack>Now that the api is available, we should add light bulb quick fixes to the
build properties source page in the manifest editor.
Man, with all these light bulbs showing up in PDE, it feels like I am working with Thomas Edison :-)
Hehe - build.properties quick fix code is now in head.
Leaving open in case we think of more quick fixes...
Hey JLB, I suggest closing this bug report and bug 131175 since the light bulb support is in for these source pages.

We could open other bug reports on a per-quickfix basis.
Closing</WithStack>

Created attachment 36084
Proposed fix
It would be nice to release this before next integration build to get a consistent behavior with bug 131373 and 131377 already released.
Thanks Olivier.  Will give it a try and see how it plays with the compiler tomorrow.

Janek, please take care of it before the I-build.
sure thing - patch released

    <WithStack>The WSDL editor allows a user to import another document using the wsdl:import element. In the graphical view, right click on Imports and select Add Import. You are given the option of importing both WSDL and XSD files through the wsdl:import element. The WS-I basic profile disallows importing XSD files with wsdl:import elements. When WS-I compliance is set to suggest this wizard should show a warning when a user selects to import an XSD file. When WS-I compliance is set to require this wizard should not allow a user to import an XSD file.
Thank you Lawrence, this sounds more like an enhancement.</WithStack>

This is quite a pain. Could we get new I-build since many might want to use the latest I-build for eclipseCon?
Are you getting this a lot in regular development Dani? Karice only saw it in the test suites.

If so can you give me steps so that I can verify.
I'll try to reproduce. I had it after starting Eclipse, typing in the editor and then doing Edit &gt; Revert while other jobs were still running. There was also a bad dialog with no text except 'error'.
See also bug 131888 and bug 131790 which indicates that this happens quite often.
*** Bug 131888 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Tod, I just had about 100 error messages fired at me during a build. The same things happened yesterday. It happened when Eclipse was rebuilding after a crash. Anything that used the progress view seemed to result in the error. If you already have it fixed, I think it is worthwhile to spin a new build.
I think we will - I am just nervous that I have never replicated it so I would appreciate it if you could load from HEAD and self host and see if you can make it happen again.
I have released this fix for the noon build

Whenever we populate a table entry we do a getIDEImageDescritpr with a path which causes us to hit the bundle code to do a lookup. The 3 icons in the problems view should be defined in workbench images so this happens once.
Fixing this reduces image lookup time on 100 items from 270ms to 5 ms

    <WithStack>Hi, this is really trivial but ... there is a missing semicolon in a code sample in the 'Java Wizard Pages' help page, in the TestCaseWizardPage, 5 lines from the bottom:  

String tearDownMathod= "public void setUp() {}"
Fixed in HEAD.

    <WithStack>latest code from HEAD. Using the sample adaper, I'm getting missing labels quite frequently. Will attach screen shot. No real steps to reproduce - it just happens sometimes, nothingin the log.
Created attachment 36085
screen shot of view
I think it's a dup of this... Did you have the Memory View hidden when you create these memory blocks... or when the debug session is started?

Not sure why it's happening tho.
