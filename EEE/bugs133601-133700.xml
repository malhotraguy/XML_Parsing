    <WithStack>The preference page for enabling/disabling model content uses the model provider label but should consult the team content extension point.
This will have to do for now since we need to load the modle provider to get the UI name. We'll need to change this in 3.3 so we can get the name from the team content descriptor.
Added a getName to ITeamContentProviderDescriptor - which will return whatever name is used in the plugin.xml for the teamContentProvider extension point. If no name is specified then it will fall back to the old behaviour.

When inside a welcome page (e.g. Overview), you can see a bar at the top with the other pages you can navigate to. If you hover on one of them, a white panel with text appears. On the mac, the white panel is too long, and covers two items. The result is that if you move your mouse to the right and try to hover on the next one, you won't see its text because you're still on the first one which was covering it.

    <WithStack>1. From the Variables View, select "b"
2. Give focus to details pane, typed "CTRL+Space". Content assist thinks that b is just an object and does not provide methods/fields for an array.

If I type this.&lt;Ctrl + Space&gt;, content assist recognizes "b" as an array and will show methods and fields for an array.  

I think this is a side effect of the details pane not being able to recognize an array.  To do evaluation for an array, I must type this.&lt;something&gt;.  For other classes, like String, I do not have type "this." to do my evaluation.

Testcase:
    	String a = new String("abcde");
    	char[] b = a.toCharArray();
"this" is working as designed. An array is an object, but there is no "receiver" class for an instanceof an array, so we allow "this" to be used as a feature - see bug 25362 (i.e. there is no Java type char[] to perform code assist in, just char[]). In the Java language, there is no place where "this" refers to an array, as you can't write methods in "array types".

Not sure we can do better. Needs investigation.
Deferred
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

Go to the Welcome preference page, switch to Overview tab and change things around. Then hit Restore Defaults. It brings you back to the Home tab. I was hoping to see the changes I made undone, but I lost context when it switched tabs.
Restore will remove all the page tabs and recreate them from the preference store. As a result, the selection will switch to the only page that will remain (the home page). What I can do is remember the currently selected page and restore this selection after the pages have been added (providing that that page is still selected).
There is no plan to fix this.</WithStack>

ContentAssistField's proposal popup and additional info should have different background colors. They currently have the same yellow background (I guess the system info bg color, but the info color is not really suitable for the list).

The Java editor already lets the user configure the proposal list colors (Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Editor). I think the colors should be the same in the Java editor and in the editor's Find/Replace dialog.

2 solutions:
a) use the system default color for the proposals list (white on WinXP)
b) Platform/UI adds the colors for the proposal popup to the Colors and Fonts preferences page and offers API to retrieve the default colors
I don't see (b) happening in any 3.2 timeframe.  Typically we try to use the same defaults as platform text's implementation.  Opened bug #133731 to consider the idea of exposing colors and other defaults as user preferences.

(a) is a very reasonable suggestion.  System info background is the default color used by PopupDialog.  ContentProposalAdapter$ContentProposalPopup could override this to use the normal system background color.
Just to make sure this is not forgotten: the system default background color should be accompanied by the system default foreground color then.
yes, both colors will be set.
There are methods in place to allow a PopupDialog subclass to do this.
Changed to use the LIST_FOREGROUND and LIST_BACKGROUND colors.

Steve, in order to fix this I need I hook in removeListener() the same way we added in addListener().

Auto activation of the proposal popup should be canceled on keystroke.

Steps:
- open Find/Replace dialog, activate regex
- type "\rrrrrrr" as fast as possible
=&gt; after a few "r"s, the proposal popup appears at the last "r" inserted

This is not the intent of the "auto activation with delay" feature. Auto activation is intended to help the user if he stops typing and starts to think about possible completions.

It should be triggered when the user types "\" and then waits a while, but the popup should not appear when the user continues typing after the trigger character.
The proposal is that if another key is hit before the popup is opened, then the popup should never open.  This is reasonable.

Fixed in ShowStratumAction. Had to use internal API in debug ui that should be made API post 3.2.

    <WithStack>3.2M5a

I want to rule out the use of HashSet (to eliminate non-determinism, we moved all our code to LinkedHashSet, which is a subclass of HashSet).

In 3.1 the restriction was OK.
In 3.2M5a the error seems too eagerly reported.

It complains about 
LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt; s= new LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt;();
s.add(2); //complains here

I'd like to have an option to make it not complain here - there's no direct access to HashSet in the code)
not a big deal since it actually resulted in better code:

Set&lt;Integer&gt; s= new LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt;();
s.add(2); //ok now
Might be related to bug 76266.
In 3.2, we did propagate access restriction on members, and thus though you restricted access to HashSet, you are still using its members indirectly through inheritance.

There are situations where this is simply wrong (think of public class extending an internal one, and you want to prevent reaching inside by mistake). 
This however feels like #add() is part of the standard contract to use. We discussed this, and post 3.2 we may want to consider method overriding/implementing public contracts to be considered as non restricted.
Will look at it post 3.2.
LATER is deprecated.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When reporting a constraint violation (or more
generally, an issue) we need to know more context.
For example, if I have several CheckComponents in
the workflow and I have an error, I want to see
which of the components (and maybe, which .chk
file and in which line) the constraint was evaluated.
This could be implemented using a utility extension is then stdlib.

For example, loc() tries to compute a sensible string that provides
the context in the model (element of type SAZ named XYZ owned by ABC).

We could provide another extension (CONLOC, for constraint location) that
constructs a string with the constraint file and the line.

I need to run several hundred snippets for testing, and there are errors in the project because some of the snippets won't compile on the current platform. It is getting pretty tedious telling the dialog that yes, I do want to launch, even though there are errors in the project.
OK - I found the preference. But it would be nicer if I could have clicked on a checkbox in the dialog to tell it not to ask again, and the dialog could have set the preference for me.
A checkbox doesn't work because a user that chooses not to launch as well as don't ask me again would end up having launches cancelled with no notification. Really need three buttons:
No - cancels the launch
Yes - continues the launch (default button)
Always - sets the preference and continues the launch.
Created attachment 37337
add an Always button

will release after M6 ships.
released patch to HEAD
Mike, please verify
verified, changed the order of the buttons to 'always', 'yes', 'no' and added a mneumonic for the always button</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When removing all the classes in our plugin, the scanner didn't pickup valid breakages from these files.    Possibly the plugin is not considered in the scan.
Hi Chuck,

I just ran the adopter scan tool, and I could not reproduce the problem that you saw. Here's what I did:

1. Unzip WTP + prereq and the scan tool
2. Launch Eclipse
3. Check out the adopter_usages folder
4. Check out the org.eclipse.jst.common.annotation.core plugin
5. Remove all classes from the plugin
6. Configure the adopter usage preference
7. Run the scan tool
8. I actually got breakage errors show up in the view

So this could be a intermittent problem. Do you have some procedures on how to reproduce this problem reliably? Thanks.
John, over to you. Thanks.
I'm closing as invalid since the last report says it can not be reproduced. Please reopen if this is still an issue. 

Verified, closing.</WithStack>

Evaluation works if I type "this.size()" instead.

    <WithStack>Found in I20060328-0010...

I had fixed a defect and had an outgoing change that I didn't want to commit so I use 'Override and Update'. The item remained in the tree even though it had been updated (note that the "Open in Compare Editor" menu item was no longer available.

I also just did a 'Mark as Merged' and the 'merge' decoration didn't go away...

I suspect this may be fixed (or will be soon as we've given a patch to JDT). I'll verify once the patch is applied.

Michael, can you verify that this is fixed in M6?? thanks.

Steps to recreate the problem:

1) Create a new Java project.
2) Create a new visual class.

Expected output:

The Visual Class should be created successfully.

Actual output:

Multiple errors occur, and the visual class isn't created. See the attached file "errorlog.txt" to view all errors in the error log view, and the attached "fig1.jpg" to view the displayed error message.

Note: This problem occurs only on Arabic locale.  The same scenario works fine on English locale.

Did you start with brand new workspace?
Also did you start Eclipse with the -clean parameter (i.e. eclipse -clean)?
I just responded to a user with a similar problem the had a corrupt Eclipse configuration and the -clean cleared up the problem.
The Java VM crashed. The file /root/workspace_ve/new_مشروع/core.20060328.194731.26396.dmp may have more info as to why it crashed.

Try to run a java application from Eclipse too. See if it able to start a java vm outside of VE.

    <WithStack>If the Manifest Editor is open, when the user changes the target platform, any plugin no longer found in the new target platform should be marked with a red X.  This happens in the require-bundle list.  Unfortunately, the dependency management section does not listen to this event.

Registered Dependency Management section to listen for IModelProviderEvents from ExternalModelManager and WorkspaceModelManager.
wouldn't it be better to listen to changes in PluginModelManager?

Sounds like a good idea to me.  Since I based the listener off of the RequireSection code, I included an update to that code in this patch also.  Now they both implement IPluginModelListner (and listen to the ModelManger) instead of IModelProviderListener.
patch applied.  thanks.

    <WithStack>Little or no validation seems to be happening in regions that are taglib tags instead of just normal HTML tags in JSP editor.

For example:

&lt;h:commandButton value="Login" action="login" /

(missing closing '&gt;') is not flagged either by the editor or by markers.  Note that:

&lt;p

(an HTML paragraph tag with missing '&gt;') is flagged by the editor (but never by markers).

Many other validation problems inside taglibs such as missing quotes on attribute values, missing '=' between attribute name and attribute value are also not being picked up when they occur inside an instance of a taglib tag.

Behaviour seen in WTP build I20060323.
I can't seem to reproduce this problem now.  I believe it was fixed when bug 116119 was fixed.
In the current I-build (Apr 20) I still reproduce the problem for project markers.    

If I have a tag like this:

&lt;h:commandButton value="Login" action="login" /&gt;

and I backspace the closing "&gt;" so that it looks like this:

&lt;h:commandButton value="Login" action="login" /
or the similarly:
&lt;h:commandButton value="Login" action="login"&gt;&lt;/h:commandButton /

Then the editor will flag the error, but it never shows up in the error markers and so doesn't show up in the problems view nor does the navigator get an error marker.

This is definitely an improvement, but is still inconsistent with the way HTML tags are validated.  For example if I take this:

&lt;/body&gt;

and change it to 

&lt;/body

Then I get expected problem markers in the Problems view, navigator _and_ the editor.
There are some kinds of validation that we only do within the editor for performance reasons, but I'm not sure if the validation just introduced is meant to function that way.  Amy?
The markup validator is reporting these errors and it's not a batch validator.  The new validator introduced in bug 160548 only checks for missing required attributes &amp; undefined attributes.  It doesn't do any sort of markup validation.
I doubt we're going to turn the markup validator into a batch validator this late in 2.0.  Removing target milestone.

The problem (on our FC5 Linux test box) appears to be that https isn't working. If you enter a https site into the internal browser widget nothing displays.  Pages using http work fine thus repositories that use http work fine in the browser pane of the task editor.
Is https working fine in the external browser?
Yes. Connecting to https sites via external browser (both firefox and mozilla) works fine.
Submit a bug report to Platform/UI prefixed with [Browser], and make this report depend on that one.

The good news is that Bug 80033 has finally been resolved, and this Platform fix should appear in 3.2.1.

    <WithStack>J9 allows the addition and removal of methods and static fields during a hot code replace.  As a result, certain field and method IDs can be created or invalidated during the HCR.

I would like the Eclipse debugger to re-reqeust field and method IDs for any class which has undergone HCR the next time a query is made for them (e.g. displaying variables in a stack frame).
This is already done - when a type is hot swapped, its cached type info is removed and recreated from the backend when needed. 

Marking as works for me, unless there is a specific bug with this.</WithStack>

Especially since there's no code in the plugin itself aside from the plugin class.
The serverdefinitions plugin is obsolote is being split but the dependencies for them are most likely to stay. Although there is no code in serverdefinitions plugins it provides full server adapter functionality.
Closing since dependencies are really needed.

    <WithStack>It will be nice to have a client side parameter validation.  This will allow to filter out / display validation error before hitting the database.

Consider the following scenario ... I have a report, which takes some begining date and ending date as the parameter and goes to database and retrives a bunch of values.  Right now there is no way to validate the format / contents of date paramter.  It will be much helpful to have a mechanism to validate and to display error (at the client side).  Currenlty the (sneaky) work around is to use String as the data type and write your own Java / JavaScript logic to validate the input for the appropriate format.

I discussed this with Mr. Scot Rosenbaum and Mr.Jason Weathersby during EclipseCon 2006 and they also agreed that this is a valid enhancement.
Consider adding script support at report parameter level, such as ClientValidate(parametervalue) script and serverValisate(paramValue, AppCOntext) for each report parameter.  Pass the client script to the browser requester page, and call the server side script with the engine scripting scope in viewer's server side JSP pages after the parameters are submitted to viewer from browser.

A roughed out fix wrapped in a plugin project for easy demo

I have written a roughed out IValidator to detect this problem.  Don't know if a general taglib validator would be a good idea in the future or not although I can see there are probably other things that could be validate in this category.
Very likely to be a dupe of bug 133642 in that they seem to be ignored completely.
Not a dupe in the sense that 133642 describes validation behaviour which exists for some elements (i.e. HTML) but not others (i.e. taglibs).  This bug is specific to taglibs and would not make any sense out side that domain AFAIS.

Also, note that taglibs are not ignored completely.  For example, if you put a JSP EL region in the attribute value for a tag, it will be validated for syntax.

However, I could see where a broad fix might address both issues.
I'm going to mark this a duplicate of bug 160548 (it mentions this missing required attributes problem along with undefined attributes)

Thanks for the proposed fix.  The actual fixed checked in pretty similar to what was proposed.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 160548 ***
The bug that is marked as a duplicate for this one includes more cases, so this should only be seen as a verification of the one original case I raised in this particular bug report.

A roughed out fix wrapped in a plugin project for easy demo

I have written a roughed out IValidator to detect this problem.  Don't know if a general taglib validator would be a good idea in the future or not although I can see there are probably other things that could be validate in this category.
Very likely to be a dupe of bug 133642 in that they seem to be ignored completely.
Not a dupe in the sense that 133642 describes validation behaviour which exists for some elements (i.e. HTML) but not others (i.e. taglibs).  This bug is specific to taglibs and would not make any sense out side that domain AFAIS.

Also, note that taglibs are not ignored completely.  For example, if you put a JSP EL region in the attribute value for a tag, it will be validated for syntax.

However, I could see where a broad fix might address both issues.
I'm going to mark this a duplicate of bug 160548 (it mentions this missing required attributes problem along with undefined attributes)

Thanks for the proposed fix.  The actual fixed checked in pretty similar to what was proposed.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 160548 ***
The bug that is marked as a duplicate for this one includes more cases, so this should only be seen as a verification of the one original case I raised in this particular bug report.

    <WithStack>Given two contexts, A and B, with undo limits of 5, and the following operations executed on the history:
B, (AB), A, A, A, A, A, A

When 5 operations have been executed in the A context, preceeding ones are flushed from the history, or in the case of op (AB), the A context is removed from the operation.  The user now has the following in the history:

B, B, A (5 times)

The user attempts to invoke undo from context B, and is incorrectly allowed to undo the operation which originally affected both A and B contexts. The problem is that other changes have occurred in A which make it impossible to undo that operation.
Do you have a specific use case/example code to demonstrate the problem or are you referring to a theoretical problem?  I'm asking because in the current SDK use cases this is not an issue.

If A were text edits and B were workspace-level operations, and one of the B operations involved the document edited by A, then the validation for the workspace-level operation would know that A had subsequently changed and disallow the operation.  If A were workspace-level operations and B were text edits, when A got purged from the (AB) op, the op would detect this and replace itself with a local text edit for B.

In other words, specific mechanisms/validation schemes tend to catch these kind of cases, so I don't know of a case where this presents a problem today.  Also, the operation history never assumes a linear undo model, so it would never decide on its own to treat this as a special case.  It's up to either the operations themselves or operation approver mechanisms to figure this out, and so far they do.  

Marking "normal" severity until there is a use case demonstrating the problem.

&gt; I'm asking because in the current SDK use cases this is not an issue.

It's "theoretical". I saw a bullet on your eclipsecon slide about supporting undo levels per context. It sounded tricky, so I took a look at the code and saw this issue. It still seems like a bug, even if a specific use case in the SDK has a workaround which masks it.

&gt; If A were text edits and B were workspace-level operations, and one of the B
&gt; operations involved the document edited by A, then the validation for the
&gt; workspace-level operation would know that A had subsequently changed and
&gt; disallow the operation.

This seems like duplication of a check that the operation history should be guaranteeing, using the default linear undo.


&gt;  If A were workspace-level operations and B were text
&gt; edits, when A got purged from the (AB) op, the op would detect this and replace
&gt; itself with a local text edit for B.

I don't think operations in general will morph when a context is removed from them.

&gt; In other words, specific mechanisms/validation schemes tend to catch these kind
&gt; of cases, so I don't know of a case where this presents a problem today.

Right, the only way to know would be to check every client of the operation history framework. The client's expectation is that by default linear undo is guaranteed, and by tagging operations with contexts, no validation is needed.
&gt;&gt; If A were text edits and B were workspace-level operations, and one of the B
&gt;&gt; operations involved the document edited by A, then the validation for the
&gt;&gt; workspace-level operation would know that A had subsequently changed and
&gt;&gt; disallow the operation.

&gt;This seems like duplication of a check that the operation history should be
&gt;guaranteeing, using the default linear undo.

Actually, model change validations more rightfully belong in the operation's validation code.  It is not a duplicate or workaround.  Consider the case when there is no editor open on A (and therefore no undo history).  The workspace-level operation still needs to know when A changes (for any reason) and invalidate itself in that case.  The validation code is not checking whether the history is linear, but whether anything affecting the operation has changed.  By assuming the operation history handles this validation, you are assuming every possible modification to A would participate in undo (which would be nice, but is unlikely).  

&gt;The client's expectation is that by default linear undo is
&gt;guaranteed, and by tagging operations with contexts, no validation is needed.
This can never be guaranteed.  A client would have to know that every possible change to a model object generates an undo.  In an open world, any plug-in could violate this premise and so it is generally not a safe assumption.  If an operation depends on a certain model state for its undo, it should be checking this state.  The API further documents that linear undo is never assumed at the operation history level.

I agree there is a potential hole in your scenario, but my gut feeling is that once necessary validation is added to operations, these cases are generally already caught.

Not quite. When editor A closes, it flushes its context. This should remove all operations which depended on the A context, *including* AB. To make this work, we should be consulting the IUndoApprover as part of flushing context A. If the approver says that AB can not be undone (which is a valid question, because the subsequent A ops will never be undone), then AB must be flushed also. If B preceeding AB can not be undone, it needs to be flushed, etc. If the approver is linear, then the entire history (B, (AB), A, A, A, A, A) would get flushed. This is the correct behavior.  If there were a "C, (CB)" at the beginning, they would get flushed too.

This bug is basically the same as another bug related to executing operations that can't be undone. Some argued that the preceeding history should be flushed. It causes the same cross-context problem unless flushing is done correctly.

&gt;  By assuming the operation history handles this validation, you are
&gt; assuming every possible modification to A would participate in undo (which
&gt; would be nice, but is unlikely).

No, I'm simply assuming that the history has performed the validation implied by its API, approver, and the existence of contexts.

&gt; &gt;The client's expectation is that by default linear undo is
&gt; &gt;guaranteed, and by tagging operations with contexts, no validation is needed.
&gt; This can never be guaranteed. 

Sure it can. I could be writing an RCP app where I'm the only one changing stuff, and I know I always use operation.  Or, the TEXT framework guarantees this by tracking its document, and if for any reason the document is modified outside of an operation, they create one on-the-fly. If somehow a client grabs the TextStore and screws with it, they are hosed and their operations don't have any way of detecting this.

&gt; A client would have to know that every possible

&gt; could violate this premise and so it is generally not a safe assumption.  If an
&gt; operation depends on a certain model state for its undo, it should be checking
&gt; this state.

This would require every operation to two complete copies of the model it affects, and run checks to ensure consistency on undo or redo. The TEXT framework does not do this. When they undo an operation, they assume that the buffer contains the same characters it did when the operation was originally executed.

&gt; The API further documents that linear undo is never assumed at the
&gt; operation history level.
&gt; I agree there is a potential hole in your scenario, but my gut feeling is that
&gt; once necessary validation is added to operations, these cases are generally
&gt; already caught. 

You can not validate every scenario, since it would require expensive copies. Furthermore, the approver is a validation mechanism already in place.

Please forget about the specific refactoring and text editing scenarios, and take a generic look at the API that has been defined. If I have:

  B, (AB), A, A

The linear approver will say "no, you can't undo (AB)". It doesn't then make sense to execute a few more As, and all of a sudden the approver says, "sure, now you can undo (AB)". The approver has now violated its job. If this is correct behavior, and operations are supposed to catch this scenario, then I don't understand the purpose of approvers or contexts.

I'm pretty sure that the best solution to this bug, and the solution to purging the history when a non-undoable operation has been executed (don't recall that bug #), would be to consult the approver(s) as part of the flush, rather than only at the time of undo.
The idea of using IOperationApprovers to validate additional modifications to the history (such as removal of contexts, etc.) is an interesting one, and should be investigated for 3.3.  I am renaming the bug to reflect this, as this is not specific to undo limits.

cc'ing Linda in case she has any interest or comment in this possible feature.

Not to beat a dead horse, but...I still maintain that checking integrity of the model affected by an operation is necessary, and a side effect of this integrity checking is that the cases you describe are generally caught anyway.

&gt;The TEXT
&gt;framework does not do this. When they undo an operation, they assume that the
&gt;buffer contains the same characters it did when the operation was originally
&gt;executed.
The text framework does not make this assumption.  It does integrity checking by checking the modification stamp of the document at the time the command was performed.  If it does not match, the operation is considered to be invalid and undo is not allowed.  In this way it *does* detect cases where someone mucked with the text store and the undo manager did not know.  Granted, when dealing with legacy plug-ins that do not support modification stamps, it does have to be more optimistic.

&gt;Not quite. When editor A closes, it flushes its context. 
My point is that if A is changed elsewhere, without a text editor ever being open, (such as by replacement in CVS, etc.) this case must be detected by any operation relying on the content of A.    Modification stamps and the like can be used for this, there is no need to make copies.  Unless every plug-in modifying A participates in undo, this validation will always be necessary.

If I grab the text store directly and modify it, the document doesn't know and the timestamp stays the same. OK, that horse is dead.

&gt; My point is that if A is changed elsewhere, without a text editor ever being

&gt; operation relying on the content of A.

Now you're talking about resource changes in the workspace and I agree that operation that operate on resources need to be guarded for unexpected resource changes (which are more likely than someone grabbing the text store). I was thinking more about the case when contexts A and B refer to working copies of documents (i.e. in memory). You generally have more control over your working copies than you do resources in the workspace.
I agree that this is a problem waiting to happen.

I think I avoided running into this issue by the nature of the undo contexts that are assigned to the GMF operations.  In GMF, each diagram editor operates on its own EMF editing domain, and there are no operations that 'span' editing domains.  In short, I don't (presently) have any case where the history can look like:

B, (AB), A, A

This would become an issue, however, if a client decided to write a diagram editor that used a different kind of undo context.  For example, if the undo context for their editor was an EMF resource, then there would most likely be operations that affect more than one resource in the same editing domain.

As an alternative to using IOperationApprovers to implement the linear undo model, I observe that IOperationHistory#operationChanged() is not used when contexts are flushed from undoable operations through the operation history.  If it were, clients implementing the linear undo model (e.g., UndoActionHandler) could listen for this notification and flush the transitive closure of all operations with intersecting contexts. Just a thought...

You don't want to flush the entire history of an intersecting context. You only need to flush starting at the point of intersection going back. It is still ok to allow undo up until the point of intersection.
investigate for 3.3
removing 3.3 milestone.  This wasn't necessary for implementing resource-based undo, and we won't be making behavior changes to the framework at this point without a high prio use case.
This message is part of a mass update...the bug is likely legitimate, but not a priority. Marking P5.  Patches would be entertained.

Sorry to enter this without reproducible steps, but I can't launch an Eclipse application in debug mode using this build. Some data points:

 - It only fails on my self-hosting workspace.  
 - In a clean workspace it works fine.
 - Launch normal Java apps is fine, but Eclipse apps or PDE Junit apps fail
 - Restarting/rebuilding doesn't fix it
 - The error message just says "Cannot connect to VM"

In the log is the following exception:

java.net.SocketException: socket closed
	at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketAccept(Native Method)
	at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.accept(PlainSocketImpl.java:384)

I just noticed that this appears in the console:

VMJ9VM007E Command-line option unrecognised: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,address=localhost:1924
Could not create the Java virtual machine.

I don't see where this "agentlib" argument is specified in the launch configuration...
The command line is generated for you to debug (agentlib is an expected argument for debugging on a 1.5 VM or higher).

Likely a dup of bug 128605. If you're using an IBM, it changes your PATH environment variable. This causes Eclipse to find the wrong dlls when attempting to debug a remote VM that is of a different version than the host VM.
In my case I'm using the same VM for both my development and test workspaces (the same IBM 1.4 VM for both).  If I revert to Eclipse I20060315, then everything works fine. So, something has changed in Eclipse in the past two weeks that is causing this to fail.
if you see "agentlib" on the debug target properties, it sounds like you're using a 1.5 VM to debug. Otherwise, we use -Xrunjdwp:....
Turned out to be a combination of bug 87039, and the new feature for bug 124045. The old bug had the VM pegged as "java version" 2.2, when it was really 1.4. The new feature changes the command line when the version is &gt; 1.4, to properly support debug options. If you've detected JREs since 3.1, this will not happen.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>As discussed before, the editor will edit and save only BPEL 2.0 files. However, import of 1.x BPEL sources ought to be possible. An import wizard needs to be written.
This could take on a simple XSLT type format initially. I know it is not going to cover everything but even a good 90% jump start is a good thing.
Consider this one for a future, major release.

E.g. see the run menu in the CVS perspective; the debug items are removed (suspend, resume, etc) but the JDT items are still there (add watchpoint, etc).

These items should not appear in perspectives they do not apply to.
This is working as expected - the jdt debug action set is associated with certain parts being open (java editor, etc). So, if an editor has focus then the action set appears to allow it to be launched.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>We need to provide some help for the Sync pref dialog.
There are two aspects I would like to see addressed:

1) The Team&gt;Models preference page does not have any F1 help.

2) The Preferences dialog for the Synchronize view (found in the view menu) does not update the help pane when a new tab is selected. It would be nice if it did. I assume it is possible since the Windows&gt;Preferences dialog does it.
Created attachment 67228
F1 help for Team &gt; Models preference page
Patch for point 1) in comment 2 released.
I do not see any clear way of updating help pane.

The preferences dialog for the Synchronize View are displayed in org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.dialogs.PreferencePageContainerDialog.java
which has his own help. For some reason help set from PreferencePage does not work, so I think I should get help context from preference page and set it in the preferencePageContainerDialog (cannot be done without PreferencePage API modification).
I had a look at the org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.PreferenceDialog class and it implements an IPageChangeProvider. It seems that help listens to page chang events from a dialog and adjust the content of the help pane based on the current page. I wonder if we could get what we want by having PreferencePageContainerDialog implement IPageChangeProvider and have the dialog fire a page change event whenever a new tab is selected.

Synchronize View help

I did as you suggested and it works pretty well except the initail state.

I really have no idea what put where to dispaly correct help for initial help view.
The patch looks good. As for the initial case, I looked in the WorkbenchHelpSystem#setHelp method and what it is doing is is calling addHelpListener on the control. Instead of calling the setHelp method, you could add a help listener yourself that, when triggered, invokes the performHelp() method on the currently visible page.

Synchronize View Preferences Help
This is not vital for 3.3 so I'm deferring it to 3.4.
Patch released
The Patch Synchronize View Preferences Help (attachment 67779) looks fine, except one thing: Workspace and Startup tabs have the same (seems to be default) help content i.e. "Each workbench window contains one or more perspectives, which are made up of various views and editors.".

As for the other patch (attachment 67228), which adds F1 help for Team &gt; Models preference page I've got one concern: I'm able to open the help pane which is still filled with an inappropriate content (see the following attachment).

    <WithOutStack>We need to provide some help for the Sync pref dialog.
There are two aspects I would like to see addressed:

1) The Team&gt;Models preference page does not have any F1 help.

2) The Preferences dialog for the Synchronize view (found in the view menu) does not update the help pane when a new tab is selected. It would be nice if it did. I assume it is possible since the Windows&gt;Preferences dialog does it.

F1 help for Team &gt; Models preference page
Patch for point 1) in comment 2 released.
I do not see any clear way of updating help pane.

The preferences dialog for the Synchronize View are displayed in org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.dialogs.PreferencePageContainerDialog.java
which has his own help. For some reason help set from PreferencePage does not work, so I think I should get help context from preference page and set it in the preferencePageContainerDialog (cannot be done without PreferencePage API modification).
I had a look at the org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.PreferenceDialog class and it implements an IPageChangeProvider. It seems that help listens to page chang events from a dialog and adjust the content of the help pane based on the current page. I wonder if we could get what we want by having PreferencePageContainerDialog implement IPageChangeProvider and have the dialog fire a page change event whenever a new tab is selected.

JDT/Core has added a new option in M6 to JavaCore called CORE_JAVA_BUILD_MAKE_OUTPUT_FOLDER_CONSISTENT that needs to be surfaced in the UI.

From JavaCore.getDefaultOptions()
* BUILDER / Make Output Folder(s) Consistent
*    Indicate whether the JavaBuilder should check that the output folders
*    are consistent while performing incremental build operations. If changes
*    are detected to managed .class files, then a full build is performed.
*     - option id: "org.eclipse.jdt.core.builder.makeOutputFolderConsistent"
*     - possible values:   { "enabled", "ignore" }
*     - default:           "ignore"
Renamed the option to:

org.eclipse.jdt.core.builder.recreateModifiedClassFileInOutputFolder=enabled


BUILDER / Recreate Modified class files in Output Folder
Indicate whether the JavaBuilder should check for any changes to .class files
in the output folders while performing incremental build operations. If changes
are detected to managed .class files, then a full build is performed, otherwise
the changes are left as is. Tools further altering generated .class files, like optimizers, should ensure this option remains set in its default state of ignore.

I'm not sure this is exactly a duplicate of 130399.  My issue was that as-you-type validation of HTML (and it seems to affect other implementors of the source validation ext-pt) does not seem to update problem markers.  It does introduce squigglies in the editor, but does not add a marker in the editor, navigator or problems view.

Problem still reproducible in wtp-sdk-S-1.5RC5-200606161055.
Cameron, as-you-type validation does not create markers.  You have to have validation enabled during builds or manually validate the file to create markers.
Lowering priority pending a response.
&gt; Cameron, as-you-type validation does not create markers.  You have to have
&gt; validation enabled during builds or manually validate the file to create
&gt; markers.

Is there any plan to have the two types of validation merge in 2.0?  The problem I see here is that there are certain very important diagnostics, like HTML syntax validation, that only get validated "as-you-type".  So if I have a web project with a broken jsp/html file, the only way I can will know is if I open every file or if I happen to hit it at runtime.
As far as I know, there is only 1 as-you-type validation that is not registered with the validation builder framework, and that's the markup validator.  HTML syntax validation should be the same for both validation.  And the difference would be one validates the saved file, and one validates the dirty/saved file currently in the editor.

I believe there is an issue with the markers not always updating when you have the file open, but if the file is closed and you right-click the file and Validate that way, are you still not seeing errors?
It looks like you are correct.  Is this issue logged elsewhere? What's the target milestone?

Yes, as bug 143213.  It will have to wait until 2.0 at this point as I think it will require nontrivial changes.

As Nitin stated in bug 143213, the validation adapters can only report errors to 1 reporter at a time, and they were only being reported to the source validation reporter when batch validation was being ran.

The current validation code actually tries to set the validation reporter to the appropriate one before calling validate.  The problem was that the setting of the reporter wasn't being propogated.  The attached patch makes sure to set the reporter to propogating validators.
Patch looks good to me, handing it off to Amy since she's done the work.
Fix was checked in and released for this week's WTP 2.0 M5 build.
Verified the original case is fixed in WTP2.0RC0.

However, new cases found during verification.  See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=187702.

Yes, as bug 143213.  It will have to wait until 2.0 at this point as I think it will require nontrivial changes.
*** Bug 126433 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Created attachment 58949
org.eclipse.wst.xml.core.patch

As Nitin stated in bug 143213, the validation adapters can only report errors to 1 reporter at a time, and they were only being reported to the source validation reporter when batch validation was being ran.

The current validation code actually tries to set the validation reporter to the appropriate one before calling validate.  The problem was that the setting of the reporter wasn't being propogated.  The attached patch makes sure to set the reporter to propogating validators.
Patch looks good to me, handing it off to Amy since she's done the work.
Fix was checked in and released for this week's WTP 2.0 M5 build.
Verified the original case is fixed in WTP2.0RC0.

However, new cases found during verification.  See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=187702.
Closing as verified.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>The Mac version of Display creates a *new window* every time a GC is constructed on it.

For example:

Display d = Display.getDefault();
GC gc = new GC(d);

This causes the following chain of calls on the Mac:
GC(d)--&gt;d.internal_new_GC()--&gt;d.createOverlayWindow()--&gt;OS.CreateNewWindow()

This means that creating and disposing of GCs frequently (inside the same method, for instance) is very slow on the mac, if you pass in a Display object rather than a Control or some other Drawable. This seems like a bug, since GCs seem intended to be created and destroyed frequently.

This is not a problem on Windows or (as far as I can tell from a cursory inspection) Linux.
We fixed this, right?
No, it is not fixed. We still create the window, we only avoid showing it until some drawing happens.

    <WithStack>What if you want a text control on a form that has no border at all? This is appropriate where you want text that is read-only but selectable with the mouse.

There is a way ...

		text.setData(FormToolkit.KEY_DRAW_BORDER, Boolean.FALSE);

but the documentation doesn't include the notation that Boolean.FALSE suppresses the border, only that some other values can be used to ADD borders when the toolkit is not inclined to supply them by default.
I assume this is referring to the javadoc in the org.eclipse.ui.forms plugin.
Yes.

Dejan, folks tell me that you're handling this area...if not just punt back.

Created attachment 104713
patch to update javadoc

I took a look at the code to confirm the described behaviour. Will add this to the javadoc for 3.5.

Hi, do you have all the pre-requisites listed in the URL below?

http://www.eclipse.org/bpel/install.php
yes, I have all that added. I was also able to compile it on the eclipse installation. That somehow should prove that everything is installed, right?

(sorry I don't know how familiar you are with Eclipse, so here are some basic questions)

Are running a runtime-workbench? A quick way to do that is to choose the menu Run-&gt;Run As-&gt;Eclipse Application.

And it is in this new workspace that you connect to CVS again and load the examples.
no problem about asking these questions.

I am running the eclipse workbench.
I used an external CVS tool to download the plugin code and the example from the cvs.

I created projects for each sub-project of the code and a single project for the sample.
I can export the 4 jar files representing the plugin.
After I copied these jar files into the eclipse plugin directory I can see that they are active.

Now I open the example project and try to open the BPEL file taken from the CVS and I do get the initially reported error.

does this help?
It is hard to tell what is wrong. Try using Eclipse as an IDE and using the CVS support from Eclipse plus following the instructions again. Once we have builds (not sure yet when) it will be easier to install.
rodrigo,

thanks for your help. I did as you stated and it works now, although I have no clue why the previous installation didn't worked.

The problem is solved!

Thanks again for the fast support!

    <WithStack>Open the cheat sheet entitled "Create a feature and Update site using PDE.
Work your way to the step "Creating the plug-in project" and press the click to perform button.
The new plug-in project dialog is opened with the cheatsheet attached to the right of the dialog.
Hit the help (?) button.

Expected result, help opens where there used to be a cheat sheet.
Actual result, no help is displayed.

Note that this sequence works fine.

Hit File-&gt;New-&gt;Project, then select "Plug Projects" and press the "?" button in the new plug in project dialog. This brings up the help page whose first sentence is "This wizard helps you create a new plug in project"

    <WithStack>In order to improve application performance, the report developer needs to be able to tell what columns from a dataset have been bound to a table. This will allow the developer to then optimize the SQL statement. For example, if only 2 columns from a dataset with 10 columns have been bound, then the select list does not need to fetch all 10 columns from the database. This reduces the data fetch thereby improving performance.
Looks new data binding framekwork provides this info.
The data binding structue has been changed. 
Users can manager the binding with data set columns by themselves.</WithStack>

I haven't been able to replicate this. Have you seen this since Olivier?

I haven't been able to replicate this. Have you seen this since Olivier?
There haven't been any other reports of this.
I saw another one, but I deleted my .log file by mistake.
So if I get it again, I'll open a new bug report.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>While scrolling around the memory view the cell editors get activated.
Closed the memory view while a cell editor was active and got an error message telling me the edit had failed because the data was invalid.

Also noticed that the memory view applies edits when I leave Eclipse. I scrolled around the view a bit, then moved from Eclipse to Firefox, when I returned to Eclipse it had marked the cell as if I had manually changed the value even though I had never intentionally done so and the new value was the same as the old value.
Deferred.  Will consider after 3.2.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>After installing Callisto, it is not possible to access Team menu on a project so to synchronize it with Subversion, using Subclipse.
Worse, in the Team Synchronizing perspective, the synchronization doesn't work correctly.
After unstinalling Callisto, everything behaves normally.

Conclusion: as is, Callisto cannot be used in development/production.

I used to see an icon to the left of links in help docs for those links that do things in the workbench (i.e. command links). I no longer see the icons, but instead a blank space where the icon should be. If the intention was to remove the icon, there shouldn't be a blank space.

See screenshot..

It is possible that the image has not been exported when building (should check build.properties for org.eclipse.sdk).
Fixed by adding the image to build.properties.

Note though that we will need to switch from this solution to using the 'img' tag in the code itself. The image needs to be inlined to flow well. Also the background image is dropped by IE in the high contrast accessability mode (unlike content image that stays).
I think you meant 3.2 M6.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I find it annoying that I have to drill down into a project or the META-INF directory to open up the manifest editor, especially when there's an Update Classpath and Migrate to 3.0 in the menu.

I'd really like an Open Manifest editor link on the Project. Fortunately, I know you guys are really busy with 3.2M5 on the corner, so I saved you the bother and wrote it for you :-)

I'll attach a patch in a sec (just got to sync to a Head to make sure it still works) and would appreciate a review of the code if possible. Some of the message handling isn't true NLS-worthy yet, for example, and I'm not sure if there's a better way of referring to the manifest than META-INF/MANIFEST.MF ...

Anyway, I've found this really useful already and I hope that other PDE users will too.

(attachment to follow)
Created attachment 37155
Adds OpenManifest to a plugin project

Adds an Open Manifest to a plugin project. This was created from HEAD so should be relatively up-to-date. I've tested it against 3.2M5 to check the functionality, but had problems with running from HEAD, so I'm not sure if I've merged the changes across well or whether there's a problem with the current version. However, I'm not going to get any more done tonight so thought it would be useful showing the first draft of the code in case anyone's got time to review it and make comments. How does one go about writing a test for this?
Thanks Alex.  It's a useful function

I took a quick look.  In addition to the TODOs you had,
1. it does not seem to recognize fragment.xml
2. the package org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor would make a better home for the action
3. the patch did not apply cleanly due to changes in PDEUIMessage that must have occurred in the meantime.

We would like to stabilize the translatable strings by M6, so that the translators can get to work.  It would therefore be good if you revise the patch before noon EST.  Otherwise, I'm not sure it will go in for 3.2

No, at present, it doesn't recognize fragment.xml, just plugin.xml and MANIFEST.MF. Shouldn't be too hard to put in a check for those though.

The other package sounds like a reasonable place for it.

I created the changes to PDEUIMessages last night, so I'm wondering what would have happened in the meantime? There were only 3 new entries anyway:

+       public static String OpenManifestsAction_cannotFind;
+
+       public static String OpenManifestsAction_cannotOpen;
+
+       public static String OpenManifestsAction_title;

Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to do work on this during office hours, so the earliest I could hit the patch again is around 20:00 GMT+1, which is after 12:00 EST, unless I can get it done before I go into work. Would it be possible to apply the changes and then fix the fragment.xml loading code later?

OpenManifest patch with new action location

I've moved the action to the new package and updated the plugin.xml accordingly. I'm not sure why the plugin.xml has so many changes; I updated it to HEAD and so there may have been some formatting done (they look mostly like whitespace changes). Not implemented fragment.xml yet; will do it this evening.
patch applied with minor changes.  thanks.
Cool. I actually extended the implementation to check for feature.xml, plugin.xml and fragment.xml if you wanted that :-) 

I also discovered that I had to put two extensions in the plugin.xml; one for the filter type nature=org.eclipse.pde.PluginNature and one for nature=org.eclipse.pde.FeatureNature (otherwise the feature.xml didn't work). I'd have liked to have one point for both, but it didn't seem to have the ability for an 'or' filter. (The other approach would have been to change the WorkbenchProject IActionFilter to understand a comma-separated list of project natures instead of just one; but that would have required more changes.)

The downside of this is if you have a selection with both features and plugins, it doesn't show the action since it's not common to all selected types.

I also changed OpenManifestAction to have fragment/features:

  || WorkspaceModelManager.hasFeatureManifest(project)
  || WorkspaceModelManager.hasFragmentManifest(project)))
and I thought this was neater on reflection:
  if (WorkspaceModelManager.hasBundleManifest(project))
    file = project.getFile("META-INF/MANIFEST.MF");
  else if (WorkspaceModelManager.hasPluginManifest(project))
    file = project.getFile("plugin.xml");
  else if (WorkspaceModelManager.hasFeatureManifest(project))
    file = project.getFile("feature.xml");
  else if (WorkspaceModelManager.hasFragmentManifest(project))
    file = project.getFile("fragment.xml");

I also caught the error when it couldn't find any manifests after my earlier patch :-)

BTW the resources are a bit odd; there's OpenManifestsAction_... and OpenManifestAction_... -- might be good to get rid of my plural name and put them all together in the same place.

Thanks for getting it in so quickly!

    <WithOutStack>I find it annoying that I have to drill down into a project or the META-INF directory to open up the manifest editor, especially when there's an Update Classpath and Migrate to 3.0 in the menu.

I'd really like an Open Manifest editor link on the Project. Fortunately, I know you guys are really busy with 3.2M5 on the corner, so I saved you the bother and wrote it for you :-)

I'll attach a patch in a sec (just got to sync to a Head to make sure it still works) and would appreciate a review of the code if possible. Some of the message handling isn't true NLS-worthy yet, for example, and I'm not sure if there's a better way of referring to the manifest than META-INF/MANIFEST.MF ...

Anyway, I've found this really useful already and I hope that other PDE users will too.

Adds OpenManifest to a plugin project

Adds an Open Manifest to a plugin project. This was created from HEAD so should be relatively up-to-date. I've tested it against 3.2M5 to check the functionality, but had problems with running from HEAD, so I'm not sure if I've merged the changes across well or whether there's a problem with the current version. However, I'm not going to get any more done tonight so thought it would be useful showing the first draft of the code in case anyone's got time to review it and make comments. How does one go about writing a test for this?
Thanks Alex.  It's a useful function

I took a quick look.  In addition to the TODOs you had,
1. it does not seem to recognize fragment.xml
2. the package org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor would make a better home for the action
3. the patch did not apply cleanly due to changes in PDEUIMessage that must have occurred in the meantime.

We would like to stabilize the translatable strings by M6, so that the translators can get to work.  It would therefore be good if you revise the patch before noon EST.  Otherwise, I'm not sure it will go in for 3.2

No, at present, it doesn't recognize fragment.xml, just plugin.xml and MANIFEST.MF. Shouldn't be too hard to put in a check for those though.

    <WithStack>Let's say I have a model with three objects: Crate, Apple and Banana.
Crate has two collection features, one for Apple and Banana. Apple and Banana, thought they always "belong" to Crate, they are not contained in Crate in the EMF sense. (This is because they need to be persisted in different Resources)

The two Crate EList features are "apples" and "bananas". The opposite of "apples" in Apple is "appleCrate" and the opposite of "bananas" in Banana is "bananaCrate".

Anyway, let's say I have a tree view of my model with the following instances:
Crate1
...Apple1
...Apple2
...Apple3
...Apple4
...Apple5
...Banana1
(the apples &amp; the banana are "inside" Create1)

The following happens when I click on Banana1:

1- my tree viewer handled SelectionEvent by firing SelectionChangedEvent.

2- that event is handled by an org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui.action.DeleteAction instance.

3- the DeleteAction calls 'createCommand(Collection selection)'

4- the createCommand method calls RemoveCommand.create(domain, selection)

5- once inside AdapterFactoryEditingDomain.createCommand(Class, CommandParameter) we reach line 445 because the commandParameter has no owner specified and BananaItemProvider overrides ItemProviderAdapter.getParent(Object) to return the banana's bananaCrate. Just in case, this is line 445 for me: "removeCommand.append(createCommand(RemoveCommand.class, new CommandParameter(parent, null, siblings)));".

6- now that createCommand has been called with an 'owner' in the commandParameter we reach line 391 ("editingDomainItemProvider.createCommand(owner, this, commandClass, commandParameter)")

7- inside ItemProviderAdapter.createCommand, since we are creating a RemoveCommand and 'commandParameter.getEStructuralFeature()' is null, we reach line 787 ("factorRemoveCommand(domain, commandParameter)")

Then "eDynamicGet(eFeature, resolve)" is called, which throws an IllegalArgumentException.

Note: there must be more than four Apples in Crate1, otherwise EcoreEList.contains(Object) will not reach line 317 ("((EObject)object).eGet(getInverseEReference())").

This is the top part of the stack trace:

EObjectWithInverseResolvingEList(EcoreEList).contains(Object) line: 317

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.
Another thing: if the Banana class had had many features, I wouldn't have noticed this behaviour because the ID of the "apples" feature would have matched the ID of one of Banana's features.

If you run an infocenter or standalone mode help, the command links still appear, but they do nothing. Actually they try to run but fail because the workbench isn't started. The links need to be disabled in infocenter and standalone modes.

Chris D., could you investigate? This might be tricky.
As I rememeber from active help docs, active help links should open a dialog or otherwise inform the user that active help is only available from a running workbench. Similar behaviour should be used for linkability commands.
I agree with Dejan, go to the page below and click the link that says "Click here for a message"

http://help.eclipse.org/help31/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/help_active.htm

You should see a dialog that says, "you need to run help locally....".  We should do the same for command links.

I'll look into this....
Sounds good to me.
Well I thought this would be easy, but I'm actually stuck on two fronts.

First, I don't know how to run help as infocenter/standalone so I basically don't know how to reproduce the problem and test a fix (if I had one).

Second, I'm surprised and can't explain why these command links don't exhibit the same behavior as the active help example I linked above.  Both active help and command links use javascript.   The active help calls javascript:liveAction(...) and the command links call javascript:executeCommand(...).  Both of those functions are defined in livehelp.js and if you look at the definition of executeCommand you see it just calls liveAction, so in both cases the code flows through very similar paths.  So basically I can't see why the error dialog appears in the active help case but not in the command link case.  I'm also not sure who creates that error dialog for the active help case.  I think if we I could find where the error dialog is created it would help.

Dejan and/or Curtis, do you have any insight on either of these questions?
It is puzzling indeed. 

Konrad, we have a live help action that is not supposed to work outside of the WORKBENCH mode (as any other live help action). When we try the sample live action specified above from the info center, the warning dialog opens up. However, when we follow our own live help action, we don't get the dialog. Why is that?
To run infocenter:

http://help.eclipse.org/help31/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/help_infocenter.html

To run standalone:

http://help.eclipse.org/help31/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/help_standalone.html


First, I see your stack if from standalone help scenario and you compare the behavior to the infocenter.  The infocenter and standalone scenarios are not the same.  Live help does not apply to infocenter, due to executing on the server, multi user, and security reasons.  However it is perfectly valid to execute live help actions in standalone help.  The action does not need need to require IDE or workbench or SWT, it may perform project creation, installation, execute external scripts, or other non UI, or non IDE tasks.

The text from the error dialog that appears in the infocter scenario is comiing from proprties, so simple text search of the webapp will reveal the properties file and the key used.  Search for the key will return place with the logic for displaying the dialog:  livehelp_js.jsp:
if(data.getMode() == RequestData.MODE_INFOCENTER){
	alert("&lt;%=UrlUtil.JavaScriptEncode(ServletResources.getString("noLiveHelpInInfocenter", request))%&gt;");
	return;
}else if(!prefs.isActiveHelp()){
	alert("&lt;%=UrlUtil.JavaScriptEncode(ServletResources.getString("noLiveHelp", request))%&gt;");

Since some people need to run livehelp in standalone, but most would rather disable them, notice there is a preference that that can be set when launching standalone and live help will not work.

In particular case of this bug, I think no changes are needed to the live help framework.  The action implementation should check its prerequisites, like if the workbench exists if it needs it.  If the workbench is not up, the action can even display an SWT dialog (if SWT exists), and I see from the stack the SWT loop is well running.
Thanks, Konrad. I missed the standalone/infocenter mismatch.

opens error dialog when command link executed in standalone help mode

Here is a patch that causes an error dialog to open when command links are executed in standalone mode.

Notes:
1) In infocenter mode the proper dialog was already appearing as Konrad pointed out.

2) Curtis, you might want to tweak the error message text if you can think of something better.

3) This patch fixes command links, which all filter through the same ILiveHelpAction implementation class (ExecuteCommandAction).  But it doesn't fix the similar problem with the lone active help link in the PDE developer guide, or any other active links.
One more thing about note (3) in the previous comment.  The ILiveHelpAction run() is called from BaseHelpSystem.runLiveHelp() which is in org.eclipse.help.base.

On the mac, if you open the help window and switch to the index view (you need to have index content present), it won't scroll and highlight keywords as you type them. This works in the index view.
Kiryl, any ideas why it might not work on Safari? We're using MacOSX 10.4, Safari 2.0.3.
I believe that the problem is somewhere in JavaScript code.

Are there any JavaScript problems reporter in Safari (like JavaScript console in Mozilla or script debugging in IE)? It would be good to see if any error occurs during typing of a keyword.

Indeed I see errors in the javascript console.. anything look familiar?

Possibly the problem in window.getSelection(), which does not returns Selection object if nothing selected in the window. I have found some discussions about this in the Internet. Hope the proposed patch will fix the problem.
Thanks Kiryl. M6 is shutting down so will apply for RC1.

    <WithStack>It'd be nice if when you drag and drop a file from the package explorer to the editor, the text inserted is the path of that file, relative to the file in the editor you just dropped it to.

For example:
WebContent
-myJSP.jsp
-myFolder
--myFile.jsp

If I drag and drop myFile.jsp onto myJSP.jsp, I would like "myFolder/myFile.jsp" to be inserted.

Currently, the file path relative to the project root is inserted instead: "WebContent/myFolder/myFile.jsp"
and, ... ideally ... its would actually insert an href= too, right, if in the right context? 


reassigning to inbox
Good idea.  But I would also think there should be a preference, some may want root relative links while others want document relative links.</WithStack>

and, ... ideally ... its would actually insert an href= too, right, if in the right context? 


reassigning to inbox
Good idea.  But I would also think there should be a preference, some may want root relative links while others want document relative links.</WithOutStack>
