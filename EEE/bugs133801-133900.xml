    <WithStack>When configuring a TCP/IP monitor, if a host name is specified with a dash, such as www.turbojugend-kuopio.com, a new monitor cannot be created.
Found the bug. It's missing the '-' during host name validation. Verified on the net that this is the only other non-alphanumeric character that is allowed in a host name.
Fixed and released in WTP 1.5 stream.

Error for a duplicate type declaration sometimes has a wrong source range.

Steps:

- copy this cu text and paste to a source folder:
package xy;
public class Try {}
class Bug {}

- copy this cu text and paste to the same source folder:
package xy;
class Bug {
    int field;
    int field2;
    int field3;
}

=&gt; source range is somewhere between field and field2 in Bug.java
=&gt; expected: source range on one of the class declaration names
Cannot reproduce with I20060330-0010.
Would you ming trying to reproduce with this build and let me know if you can do it.
Closign as WORKSFORME. Reopen if you get it again.
Closing.
Can still reproduce with I20060331-2000, though steps are somewhat timing-dependent...:

- new workspace
- create new Java project "P" (all defaults)
- in Package Explorer, paste first CU text into project P
- wait for autobuild to finish
- paste second CU text into project P

It only seems to be happening if class Bug already exists as secondary type and then Bug.java is added and incrementally compiled.
I tried again and I cannot reproduce.
I'll try to see how this could be related to a timing issue.
I tried to reproduce. Unsuccessfully.
Also can't reproduce any more. Worksforme.</WithStack>

JDT Core added a new option JavaCore#CORE_JAVA_BUILD_RECREATE_MODIFIED_CLASS_FILES_IN_OUTPUT_FOLDER:

* BUILDER / Recreate Modified class files in Output Folder
*    Indicate whether the JavaBuilder should check for any changes to .class files
*    in the output folders while performing incremental build operations. If changes
*    are detected to managed .class files, then a full build is performed, otherwise
*    the changes are left as is. Tools further altering generated .class files, like optimizers,
*    should ensure this option remains set in its default state of ignore.

    <WithStack>hi,

 at the moment "Correct Indentation" is an action that applies to an editor. It would be great if the same action were available as an action on resources selected in the package explorer. i.e. you would be able to select a project, or a source folder, or a discontiguous selection of sources and correct their indentation as a single action. 

At the moment you would have to open each file individually, invoke the action and save it.

thanks,
Andrew
Use format for this.
hi Daniel,

 I see your point, but was already aware of the format option, and believe there is value in having "Correct Indentation" treated separately?

If for a single file, you have a choice between CI and full-blown-format, then it would make sense to me that this same choice be available for a selection of multiple files? This isn't purely about symmetry in the UI however - reindenting a source tree is likely to be non-controversial, but reformatting a source tree can easily raise religious arguments about the Correct formatting style. I never reformat source files on team projects for this reason since other developers (perhaps not using eclipse) could object. 

Its probably not an urgent work item, but in terms of UI consistency I currently think its the right thing to do long term?

(I've reopened the bug just in case messages aren't sent when its marked resolved, rather than pre-empting any decision :)

thanks,
Andrew
&gt;reindenting a source tree is likely to be non-controversial, but reformatting a
&gt;source tree can easily raise religious arguments about the Correct formatting
&gt;style.
Well, indenting is already part of formatting and very religious, e.g. some people use tabs, some spaces and others use the mixed version and in fact we grab the preferences from the formatter to do the indenting.

Martin, what's your take on this?
I think the request makes sense. Indenting is less intrusive than formatting.
As we already have the action, it's a value add to also offer it on multiple files.
Marking as fixed &gt; 3.4M2

There is a correct indentation clean up. Clean up can be executed on any set of java elements. Adding a correct indentation action to java elements would now be trivial (by extending CleanUpAction) but I don't think it is necessary. What you think?

having this available in the clean-up wizard is great news :)

if I get a vote then +1 for the additional correct indentation action, on the basis of convenience and ui consistency. It would be nice to be able to select some projects and hit ctrl-I, analogously to how organize imports can be used.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>An ODA design ui extension, which implements the connection profile and oda.design.ui.dataSource extension points, has to provide concrete class implementation of the connection profile wizard page and property page.

This enhancement is for the ODA framework to provide default implementation of the ODA abstract base classes for the data source connection profile's ui pages.
The default implementation provides a generic properties ui page to allow an user to specify values for the data source connection properties defined by an ODA extension in its dataSource.properties element of the 
org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.oda.dataSource extension point.

An ODA design ui extension can then simply use or extend from these default implementation classes.
Contributed default oda.design.ui implementation classes:

I think this problem is very similar to the one on 127879 Bug, but the solution he gives -change from jdk 1.4.1 to jdk 1.4.2- doesn't work for me as I already have a jdk 1.4.2 version.
I cannot reproduce this with the 1.5 build.

Using the ant productBuild.xml file, however, these entries are ignored.  It would be useful if this could be updated to include support for launcherArgs.
The generation of the config.ini has been introduced post M5. For example if you pick today's I build you will have this function.</WithStack>

I don't see how this bug is related to apps.eclipse.org - the application servers running J2EE applications on eclipse.org.

    <WithStack>Overview Description: My environment variables are not known in Eclipse. The variables are declared system wide (in my .login file) so they are known in the environment from which Eclipse is started. However if I go to (in Eclipse); run -&gt; run environment -&gt; select, no variables show. It does not depend on the view.

Steps to Reproduce:
Run Eclipse on Solaris 8 and go to; run -&gt; run environment -&gt; select, and check if the variables are displayed.

Actual Results:
No variables are displayed.

Expected Results:
All the environment variables defined in the environment from which Eclipse was started should be displayed.

Build Date &amp; Platform: Date and platform of the build that you first encountered the bug in.

Version 3.1.2 Build id M20060118-1600 on Solaris 8 SunOS Release 5.8 Generic_117350-18

Additional Builds and Platforms: The problem does not occur on Windows XP SP2.

How are you launching Eclipse? What windowing system are you using?
Eclipsed doesn't do anything special to set its environment, it just accepts the environment that it was launched in.
I launch eclipse by calling the the executable in a terminal ( /somedirs/eclipse/eclipse &amp; ).
The windowing system in use is CDE. I use tshell, but using another shell doesn't resolve the problem.
If I do a printenv in the terminal from which I launch eclipse I do see all me environment variables.
Apparently it does work for some colleagues, for some others it does not. I still have to find the reason (user account, machine, etc).
I will post the solution as soon as I have it.
Adding:
set path = ( $path /usr/ucb )
to my .login file fixes the problem for me. I don't (yet) understand why though.
Apparently Eclipse uses /usr/ucb/printenv to obtain the environment. Maybe /usr/bin/env would have been better.
Eclipse just executes "printenv", so whichever version is on your path first will be found.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hi,

when upgrading from 3.2-M3 to 3.2M5 I discovered the following problem with content assist in java editors:

When typing sun.awt. and hitting ctrl-space the content assist window opens and shows its contents. But the UI thread is blocked for the next 10-30 seconds. When navigating through the list the UI gets blocked again on each item, that has no source code attachment.

This problem only occur when working behind a firewall. When I disconnect from the network the problem disappears. I assume that some network lookup is done when no source code is available in order to display the api doc tooltip.

The problem probably was introduced with 3.2M4 since a colleague of mine told me that he has the same problem with 3.2M4 (he is working for a different company but they have a firewall as well).

    <WithStack>This bug happens on Windows XP and Mac OSX on 3.2M5a.  Steps to reproduce:

1. right click a class and select 'New JUnit Test case'
2. fill in first page
3. Click next to go to second page
4. Select Objects constructor Object.Object() (any of Object's methods would do)
5. Check 'Create tasks for generated test methods'
6. Click finish

The error below is generated, and an empty file is created for the new test which you need to delete before trying again.

Markus, if trivial I suggest to fix this for M6

    <WithOutStack>This bug happens on Windows XP and Mac OSX on 3.2M5a.  Steps to reproduce:

1. right click a class and select 'New JUnit Test case'
2. fill in first page
3. Click next to go to second page
4. Select Objects constructor Object.Object() (any of Object's methods would do)
5. Check 'Create tasks for generated test methods'
6. Click finish

The error below is generated, and an empty file is created for the new test which you need to delete before trying again.

sometimes with a lot of results it's easier just to run down with the yellow arrows and see everything -- sometimes one wishes to open all results in different editors.
always switching to the preferences and toggle the checkbox is a bit awkward.
I added a direct link to the preferences in the search result view menu.

Hope that help a bit.

Extract Supertype action can take a long time and is not cancellable. The problem seems to be in
    ExtractSupertypeMemberPage$6.run(IProgressMonitor) line: 323
, which can take a long time if the indexes are not up-to-date. The runnable is not cancellable and runs in the UI thread, so Eclipse appears locked.

Such long running operation should be done in checkInitialConditions(..), which is run in the background and is cancellable.

Extract Supertype action can take a long time and is not cancellable. The problem seems to be in
    ExtractSupertypeMemberPage$6.run(IProgressMonitor) line: 323
, which can take a long time if the indexes are not up-to-date. The runnable is not cancellable and runs in the UI thread, so Eclipse appears locked.

Such long running operation should be done in checkInitialConditions(..), which is run in the background and is cancellable.

    <WithStack>The DTP oda.design.ui.dataSource extension point defines a "newDataSetWizard" element, which can be actually used in both creating and editing an ODA data set design. 
The name is somewhat misleading.  It should be refactored to rename to "dataSetWizard" to reflect its intended usage.  The corresponding base class should also be renamed from NewDataSetWizard to DataSetWizard.

    <WithStack>Hi,

How can I use the 'Win' (Super_R/L on Linux) as metakey in eclipse? 

For me it is currently impossible to use a "Win+&lt;what_key_ever&gt;" combination, since the "Win" key doesn't show up when pressed within the key sequence field in the key settings dialog.

Eclipse version is 3.1.2 on GNU/Linux.

Any help welcome.

Regards,
Ruben

Just changing "keyword" and severity to allow better queries.

Changing OS from Mac OS to Mac OS X as per bug 185991</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050627-1435

Opening an external file (File -&gt; Open File...) for which I don't have read permission causes a FileNotFoundException which doesn't seem to be caught -- it appears as an Internal Error in the Error Log View.

    <WithStack>In our code we have a need to bring up an NewWizard (as in org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.NewWizard), for that purpose we use thr following internal class:
org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.NewWizard

It would be good to have an ability to do the same thing using the external APIs
Not to pick nits, but I have a nit to pick.  :)  There are no internal APIs - the phrase is an oxymoron.

Having gotten that out of the way I believe there is a way to accomplish this already via the NewWizardAction which is public.  Is that API sufficient or are you trying to use more NewWizard methods than this action exposes?
Ivy, please check if the NewWizardAction is sufficient for our purposes

Can we close this Ivy?

We have no plans at this time to make this API. Feel free to open an enhancement request.

When I search I cannot get back to the main table of contents.

STEPS
1) Open help
2) Enter properties pages into the search area and search
3) Select the hierarchy icon
4) it will pop up momentarily and then the search results will cover it again. There is no way to close the search results.
It seems to work ok for me. A few things to try..

- Does it work if you view help in an external browser?
- If no, does it work at http://help.eclipse.org/help31/index.jsp ?

Are you using a new IE 7 beta?
This is in the embedded help browser. I am a Firefox user but I don't expect that should be any factor.

That URL works fine in Firefox
Tod, are you still seeing this? I can't reproduce and suspect that after the rewrite of parts of the help webapp this bug is no longer there. 
I think it is OK to close this
Closing.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In order to initialize the commands that are used to create the webservices, in our code we have to create a new instance of EclipseEnvironment, to do that we use the following internal classes:

org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.eclipse.EclipseEnvironment;
org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.ui.eclipse.EclipseStatusHandler;
org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.core.context.TransientResourceContext;

we also use org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.core.selection.BooleanSelection;
to initialize some boolean selections in one of the commands

We believe that this would be beneficial to make these classes/APIs external

Not to worry. This is from core.expressions and just happened to have the same name as the element I deleted.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In our code we currently have a need to prgramatically create a java project. Currently we use the following internal classes to achieve that:

org.eclipse.jst.common.jdt.internal.integration.IJavaProjectCreationProperties 
org.eclipse.jst.common.jdt.internal.integration.JavaProjectCreationDataModelProvider 

 We think it would be beneficial to make these classes/APIs external
If it's just a Java project, isn't this a JDT requirement?
See  FacetProjectCreationDataModelProvider  and its  hierarchy,  dont use 
JavaProjectCreationDataModelProvider


(In reply to comment #2)
&gt; See  FacetProjectCreationDataModelProvider  and its  hierarchy,  dont use 
&gt; JavaProjectCreationDataModelProvider

I checked the hierarchy of "FacetProjectCreationDataModelProvider", I only found "J2EEFacetProjectCreationDataModelProvider" and "SimpleWebFacetProjectCreationDataModelProvider", which one I should use for creating JAVA project? What about the properties interface file?
Please provide more details on this or an example will be great. thanks
UtilityProjectCreationDataModelProvider, it doesn't create vanila Java project but a "faceted" Java Utility project,  i dont know if this is what you want.
Is the "faceted" Java Utility project an extension of vanila Java project? We had code to create Java project from UI (through standard Java Project Wizard) and command line, the problem here is for our command line case, we prefer to create the same project from both way, but if there is no vanila Java project creation code, then we can think about to change it, but we have to make sure the "faceted" project does NOT contain LESS "functionality". 

By the way, if we create java utility project, do you need to set "source folder", "output location", "classpath entry" (jre container) etc... (those are what we had to set for vanila Java project before)? if yes, so which properties interface we should use? Is there any extra property we should set to this new project type? thanks for your time.
Utility project in WTP is understandable by its API's, it also allows you to set Server contrainer,  and yes since it is a Java project it provides you capability what a JDT created Java project has.
I am closing this bug for now.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Snap-to-grid does not work for a child node *immediately* inside a top level node. That is, a child node which is created inside a top level node without any compartments.
The generator has the capability to contain shapes directly inside another shape instead of indirectly through a shape compartment.  The runtime hasn't likely accounted for this case.

    <WithStack>Requirement: Multiple Lines of Copied content has to be pasted in one line with a space(" ") as separator.

If Multiple lines are copied, all content which was copied is not getting pasted(either using CTRL+V or a using rightclick (popup menu item) paste). Only First Line of the Selected content is getting pasted.

If I used SWT.MULTI in text box creation, Copied content(Multiple Lines) is getting pasted in Multiple Lines but not pasted in a single line.

Where as in swing, Multiple Lines of Copied content was getting pasted in one line with " " separator.
Hi,

I want to add this bug,

i want to capture CTRL+V call for text field and call some method which can process the data in clipboard. 

I used setAccelarator method, but its not working.
The following works for me:

public static void main (String [] args) {
	Display display = new Display ();
	Shell shell = new Shell (display);
	shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
	final Text text1 = new Text(shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.SINGLE);
	text1.setText("single");
	text1.addVerifyListener(new VerifyListener() {
		public void verifyText(VerifyEvent e) {
			//System.out.println("Verify "+e.text);
			String string = e.text;
			if (string.indexOf('\n') != -1 || string.indexOf('\r') != -1) {
				string = string.replace('\r', ' ');
				string = string.replace('\n', ' ');
				text1.setSelection(e.start, e.start + string.length());
				text1.insert(string);
				e.doit = false;
			}
		}
	});
	Text text2 = new Text(shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.MULTI | SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.V_SCROLL);
	text2.setText("multiple\na\nb\nc\r\nd");
	shell.open ();
	while (!shell.isDisposed ()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();
	}
	display.dispose ();
}
Oops, setting the selection can delete some text after the insertion point.  This is a better example:


public static void main (String [] args) {
	Display display = new Display ();
	Shell shell = new Shell (display);
	shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
	final Text text1 = new Text(shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.SINGLE);
	text1.setText("single");
	text1.addVerifyListener(new VerifyListener() {
		public void verifyText(VerifyEvent e) {
			//System.out.println("Verify "+e.text);
			String string = e.text;
			if (string.indexOf('\n') != -1 || string.indexOf('\r') != -1) {
				string = string.replace('\r', ' ');
				string = string.replace('\n', ' ');
				text1.insert(string);
				e.doit = false;
			}

package xy;

class Super {

- select m, extract superclass, name it "Middle"

=&gt; was:
class Sub extends 
Middle {
}

=&gt; expected:
class Sub extends Middle {

The formatting is OK if the option mentioned in comment 0 is not enabled. The implementation just replaces one SimpleType by another one.

Seems to be a problem with ASTRewrite.
is it an ast rewrite issue?
Yes, see my comment 1.

The completed flag is the first sort critera of the tasks but if you add a user task it is sorted after the non editable ones. If  a task is not completed it should not affect the sort order.
We also need to show sort criteria in the TasksView
This is fixed in the new tasks view

    <WithStack>-sourcepath support is ok for directory, but it doesn't seem to work for jar or zip files.
In org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.batch.ClasspathJar, we are only looking for .class files. Never for source files.
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.batch.ClasspathDirectory is correctly checking source files and class files.
-sourcepath sourcepath
    Specify the source code path to search for class or interface definitions. As with the user class path, source path entries are separated by semicolons (;) and can be directories, JAR archives, or ZIP archives. If packages are used, the local path name within the directory or archive must reflect the package name.

    Note:   Classes found through the classpath are subject to automatic recompilation if their sources are found. 
Created attachment 37664
Proposed fix

To verify, try to compile the following code:
public class X extends p.Bar {
}

where p.Bar is located within a zip or a jar file and you run the batch using:

D:/tests_sources/X.java 
-d d:\tests_sources
-classpath d:\tests_sources
-sourcepath d:\tests_sources\lib.zip
-time
-g
-1.5
-preserveAllLocals
Maxime and Philippe,

Let me know if you believe that this should be fixed. The attached patch works well and in fact javac 1.5 doesn't handle this case well and javac 6.0 fails to create p.Bar in the right folder. It creates a folder called "lib.zip(p" in which it puts Bar.class. So at runtime, the class p.Bar is not found.
javac 1.5 compiles referenced types in place. If you use the following setup:
src/Used.java
User.java
public class User {
  Used m;
}

and do javac -sourcepath src User.java, you get the following new files:
src/Used.class
User.class

I believe that this would call for a clarification of the use of the -sourcepath option if it were to accept archives (notwithstanding its interaction with other options).
Fixing this would make -sourcepath compatible with what javac supports (in theory).

-sourcepath sourcepath
    Specify the source code path to search for class or interface definitions. As with the user class path, source path entries are separated by semicolons (;) and can be directories, JAR archives, or ZIP archives. If packages are used, the local path name within the directory or archive must reflect the package name.

    Note that classes found through the classpath are subject to automatic recompilation if their sources are found.

It could be convenient to compile using a zip that contains the source code. Might be slower though.
Philippe,

Do you want this to be fixed?
Technically we are ok with the description in the print usage of the batch compiler, but this is not equivalent to the same option for javac. So to have a better compatibility between the two compilers, it could be a plus.

If we don't fix it, we might verify that elements on the -sourcepath option are directories and reject jar/zip files.
Maxime,

Could you please review the patch?
+1 for 3.2RC1
Created attachment 38355
New patch

Maxime,

This new patch defines a subclass of ClasspathJar called ClasspathSourceJar to handle the case of the -sourcepath.
I also updated the print usage.
All generated files are put in the output folder. This makes a more consistent behavior.
I will release if all tests passed.

This is a blocker: the IDE freezes.

This is a bug in our CharacterIterator that got leveraged by the icu implementation of BreakIterator which uses different API on the character iterator. Verified and fixed all other occurrences.

Fixed in HEAD.
Available in builds &gt;= I20060329-1600.
Test case: double click on a word at the end of a line.

In examing the code, there is nothing that could *possibly* be null, except for 
fActions variable. While this variable is initialized to to a hashmap, it is set to null in the 'dispose' method.  So, I'm guessing in the case of our two page XML Editor, under heavy load, some part of the editor is closed/closing before the openeditor is completely finished (and, as part of the opening, we do "change pages" according to a preference setting ... if that is maybe a path not as well thread protected)? 

I will pass on to the text componet for comment. 

Dani, do you think fActions should be better protected? Or, I'd guess ... at some higher level? 

Also, please note, according to the 0,7 in 'version' field in this bugzilla, this would be on the Eclipse 3.1 stream, though this code in the top of the stack trace appears to be the same in both streams 3.1 and 3.2. 

I am marking as low priority (if it leaves it as '4' when changing components) since this appears to be very rare failure and perhaps should just be taken as input for future improved thread protection? 

 
Similar problems have been reported in bug 30913 and bug 54300.
David, could you reproduce this?
No, I have not seen (but also have no good tests for "under heavy load" ... and not exaclty sure what that means, from originators point of view .. I guess just lots of CPU/UI use). 




In reply of above, a few precisions :
- It's a 3.2m5a + callito plugins + subversive plugin set environment
- I think I hadn't any allready opened xml file at the time I tried to open this one
- Eavy load indeed means : lot of CPU, nearly all RAM (compiling in the background)

Daniel, can you suggest a slot for me to place this on the Platform UI side ?(I'm a little confused about how it ended up here...)

Hi Eric, hard to tell. The problem seems to be part (de-)activation happening on already disposed parts.
Sorry but it is not under Platform Text's control when a disposed editor gets activated.

There are only two possibilities for the NPE:
1) VM/JIT bug
2) disposed editor gets activated

So, I'm guessing in the case of our two page XML Editor, under heavy load, some part of the editor is closed/closing before the openeditor is completely finished (and, as part of the opening, we do "change pages" according to a preference setting ... if that is maybe a path not as well thread protected)? 

I will pass on to the text componet for comment. 

Dani, do you think fActions should be better protected? Or, I'd guess ... at some higher level? 

Also, please note, according to the 0,7 in 'version' field in this bugzilla, this would be on the Eclipse 3.1 stream, though this code in the top of the stack trace appears to be the same in both streams 3.1 and 3.2. 

I am marking as low priority (if it leaves it as '4' when changing components) since this appears to be very rare failure and perhaps should just be taken as input for future improved thread protection? 

 
Similar problems have been reported in bug 30913 and bug 54300.
David, could you reproduce this?
No, I have not seen (but also have no good tests for "under heavy load" ... and not exaclty sure what that means, from originators point of view .. I guess just lots of CPU/UI use). 




In reply of above, a few precisions :
- It's a 3.2m5a + callito plugins + subversive plugin set environment
- I think I hadn't any allready opened xml file at the time I tried to open this one
- Eavy load indeed means : lot of CPU, nearly all RAM (compiling in the background)

Daniel, can you suggest a slot for me to place this on the Platform UI side ?(I'm a little confused about how it ended up here...)

Hi Eric, hard to tell. The problem seems to be part (de-)activation happening on already disposed parts.
Sorry but it is not under Platform Text's control when a disposed editor gets activated.

There are only two possibilities for the NPE:
1) VM/JIT bug
2) disposed editor gets activated

For Tomcat  which uses  J2EEUtil.getWebModules()

these is call to String uri = web.getURI( modules2[j] );,  but it is not used, that should be  fixed as well.

In The WarModuleAssembler the third paramter should just be parent, 
since the webModule.getURI(module)  will return the path with  WEB-INF/lib

    <WithStack>Using 3.2/M5

Looking at the Extension Point Reference for org.eclipse.help.toc I see the following:

  &lt;!ATTLIST toc label CDATA #REQUIRED &gt; 

This is surprising to me.  I'm porting some old and crusty plugins from Eclipse 2.1, where at runtime a &lt;toc&gt; did NOT require a label attribute (although it seems that the Eclipse 2.1 doc says it is required).  Here's the setup I have.

#
# primary.xml
#
&lt;toc label="My Book" topic="books/bookset.html"&gt;
  &lt;topic label="Getting Started" href="books/getting-started/book.html"&gt;
    &lt;anchor id="getting-started"/&gt;
  &lt;/topic&gt;
&lt;/toc&gt;

#
# getting-started.xml
#
&lt;toc link_to="toc/primary.xml#getting-started"&gt; 
  &lt;topic
    label="Introduction"
    href="books/getting-started/introduction.html"/&gt;
  &lt;topic
    label="Software Architecture"
    href="books/getting-started/architecture.html"/&gt;
&lt;/toc&gt;

#
# plugin.xml
#
&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;extension point="org.eclipse.help.toc"&gt;
    &lt;toc file="toc/primary.xml" primary="true"/&gt;
    &lt;toc file="toc/getting-started.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;


Since my primary.xml has an &lt;anchor&gt; element nested inside a &lt;topic&gt; with a label, there should be no need for me to provide a label when I define the &lt;toc&gt; that attaches to the &lt;anchor&gt;.

Not surprisingly, the following is written to the .log:

  java.lang.RuntimeException: toc label==null
    at org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.parseInternal(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.parse(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.crimson.parser.XMLReaderImpl.parse(Unknown Source)
    at javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser.parse(Unknown Source)
    at org.eclipse.help.internal.toc.TocFileParser.parse(TocFileParser.java:89)
The work around is to specify a label attribute with an empty string.  If you specify non-empty string it does not get displayed anywhere.

#
# getting-started.xml
#
&lt;toc label="" link_to="toc/primary.xml#getting-started"&gt; 
  &lt;topic
    label="Introduction"
    href="books/getting-started/introduction.html"/&gt;
  &lt;topic
    label="Software Architecture"
    href="books/getting-started/architecture.html"/&gt;
&lt;/toc&gt;

But of course this is meaningless.

The logic should be smarter.

Back in Eclipse 2.x, people would forget to put on labels when they were supposed to, and then be surprised why their navigation tree was behaving oddly. And there was no debug message in the log to say "Hey! This is primary in the ToC, you need to have a label!"

So, to ease their ability to debug, updated the code to make it required. This has the unforseen side effect that you report specifically for the &lt;link-to&gt; case.

So really, are you saying that IF my &lt;toc&gt; has a link-to attribute, THEN label should be optional?

Seems like there is a related rfe about this--because when your doc is componentized and used in multiple places, sometimes it might end up in a bigger offering that it wants to be the "top dog" &lt;toc&gt; and would need a label to display, while others it is linked into a larger doc set. Some run-time smarts that says "This time, the &lt;toc&gt;'s label is needed and this time, it's linking into something else." so the author doesn't have to change the source file whenever the doc plug-in is being reused elsewhere.

But then the original author would still need to supply a label, which brings it back to having the label required. :-) Requiring a label supports reuse--for when someone later wants to reuse those toc branches that you today are linking into something else.
&gt;&gt;So really, are you saying that IF my &lt;toc&gt; has a link-to attribute,
&gt;&gt;THEN label should be optional?

Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.

I understand your point of view, and applaud the attempt to serve both the simple and the advanced scenarios. But, from what you say, it is neither of these cases that is causing the problem.  It seems that the problem is caused by the goal of helping out the hapless developer that has coded up their XML incorrectly.  While I agree that helping debug problems is important, it should probably be considered a secondary goal.

Of course this is all rather minor, in that those people implementing the simple case only need to specify the label attribute as being an empty string.  But, this does sound a little bogus to me, but if you really think that the debug scenario is important, then so be it.

Maybe setting the label to an empty string should be documented and explained.  But it sounds like you're punishing the diligent developer.  ;-)

Part of the problem I see is that it is confusing to know which label ends up being displayed by the help system- the one in the toc/topic being linked to, or the one in the topic that is doing the linking.  I never saw this mentioned in the eclipse help docs.

Example:
# primary.xml
&lt;toc label="My Book" topic="books/bookset.html"&gt;
  &lt;topic label="Getting Started" href="books/getting-started/book.html"&gt;
    &lt;anchor id="getting-started"/&gt;
  ...

# getting-started.xml
&lt;toc link_to="toc/primary.xml#getting-started" label="My Getting Started"&gt; 
  &lt;topic label="Introduction"
   ...

If I remember correctly, the result in the generated TOC that you see in eclipse would be like:

My Book
- Getting Started
-- Introduction

So it's confusing for developers that you have to specify a label in both places when one of them ends up being ignored anyway.  Granted if the getting-started TOC were ever by itself as it's own book, it's label would then be used.
I think the issue is bigger than whether there should be a label or not. This discussion relates to Bug 195577 that I opened to address what I think is an architectural weakness in the way the TOC is built up. 

I think the &lt;toc&gt; node should never be displayed at all in the TOC hierarchy, even when primary="true". You can read my discussion there, but essentially problems occur when the TOC designed to be primary is consumed at a lower level. I think the Help system should display only the &lt;topic&gt; nodes exactly as the user authors them. I recognize that this would be a major change, but it would increase consumability of TOCs and improve predictability.
There is no plan to implement this.</WithStack>

Since my primary.xml has an &lt;anchor&gt; element nested inside a &lt;topic&gt; with a label, there should be no need for me to provide a label when I define the &lt;toc&gt; that attaches to the &lt;anchor&gt;.

Not surprisingly, the following is written to the .log:

  java.lang.RuntimeException: toc label==null
    at org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.parseInternal(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.parse(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.crimson.parser.XMLReaderImpl.parse(Unknown Source)
    at javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser.parse(Unknown Source)
    at org.eclipse.help.internal.toc.TocFileParser.parse(TocFileParser.java:89)
The work around is to specify a label attribute with an empty string.  If you specify non-empty string it does not get displayed anywhere.

#
# getting-started.xml
#
&lt;toc label="" link_to="toc/primary.xml#getting-started"&gt; 
  &lt;topic
    label="Introduction"
    href="books/getting-started/introduction.html"/&gt;
  &lt;topic
    label="Software Architecture"
    href="books/getting-started/architecture.html"/&gt;
&lt;/toc&gt;

But of course this is meaningless.

The logic should be smarter.

Back in Eclipse 2.x, people would forget to put on labels when they were supposed to, and then be surprised why their navigation tree was behaving oddly. And there was no debug message in the log to say "Hey! This is primary in the ToC, you need to have a label!"

So, to ease their ability to debug, updated the code to make it required. This has the unforseen side effect that you report specifically for the &lt;link-to&gt; case.

So really, are you saying that IF my &lt;toc&gt; has a link-to attribute, THEN label should be optional?

Seems like there is a related rfe about this--because when your doc is componentized and used in multiple places, sometimes it might end up in a bigger offering that it wants to be the "top dog" &lt;toc&gt; and would need a label to display, while others it is linked into a larger doc set. Some run-time smarts that says "This time, the &lt;toc&gt;'s label is needed and this time, it's linking into something else." so the author doesn't have to change the source file whenever the doc plug-in is being reused elsewhere.

But then the original author would still need to supply a label, which brings it back to having the label required. :-) Requiring a label supports reuse--for when someone later wants to reuse those toc branches that you today are linking into something else.
&gt;&gt;So really, are you saying that IF my &lt;toc&gt; has a link-to attribute,
&gt;&gt;THEN label should be optional?

Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.

I understand your point of view, and applaud the attempt to serve both the simple and the advanced scenarios. But, from what you say, it is neither of these cases that is causing the problem.  It seems that the problem is caused by the goal of helping out the hapless developer that has coded up their XML incorrectly.  While I agree that helping debug problems is important, it should probably be considered a secondary goal.

Of course this is all rather minor, in that those people implementing the simple case only need to specify the label attribute as being an empty string.  But, this does sound a little bogus to me, but if you really think that the debug scenario is important, then so be it.

Maybe setting the label to an empty string should be documented and explained.  But it sounds like you're punishing the diligent developer.  ;-)

Part of the problem I see is that it is confusing to know which label ends up being displayed by the help system- the one in the toc/topic being linked to, or the one in the topic that is doing the linking.  I never saw this mentioned in the eclipse help docs.

Example:
# primary.xml
&lt;toc label="My Book" topic="books/bookset.html"&gt;
  &lt;topic label="Getting Started" href="books/getting-started/book.html"&gt;
    &lt;anchor id="getting-started"/&gt;
  ...

# getting-started.xml
&lt;toc link_to="toc/primary.xml#getting-started" label="My Getting Started"&gt; 
  &lt;topic label="Introduction"
   ...

If I remember correctly, the result in the generated TOC that you see in eclipse would be like:

My Book
- Getting Started
-- Introduction

So it's confusing for developers that you have to specify a label in both places when one of them ends up being ignored anyway.  Granted if the getting-started TOC were ever by itself as it's own book, it's label would then be used.
I think the issue is bigger than whether there should be a label or not. This discussion relates to Bug 195577 that I opened to address what I think is an architectural weakness in the way the TOC is built up. 

I think the &lt;toc&gt; node should never be displayed at all in the TOC hierarchy, even when primary="true". You can read my discussion there, but essentially problems occur when the TOC designed to be primary is consumed at a lower level. I think the Help system should display only the &lt;topic&gt; nodes exactly as the user authors them. I recognize that this would be a major change, but it would increase consumability of TOCs and improve predictability.
There is no plan to implement this.</WithOutStack>

* From the Registers View, select a register

When the rendering is added, the column's width is too small.  

Try the same thing again, the second rendering has its columns sized properly.

Will attach screen capture.
Created attachment 37210
screen capture
Fixed in AsynVirtualContentTableViewer.

Rendering was packing the columns before the table is visible.  As a result, the column size was calculated based on the width of the column header instead of basing it on the content.

The fix is to check that the table is actually visible before attempting to pack the columns.  If the table is not yet visible, set "pending pack flag" to true.  The viewer will try to pack the columns again when the content is displayed.
Correction with steps to reproduce:
* Use com.abc.sampleAdapter (extended memory block)
* Launch debug session
* Memory view needs to be hidden (** this is different from before.)
* From the registers view, select a register and add a rendering.
* Brings the Memory View to the top.

I would expect FileSystemContributor.browseFileSystem(String,Shell) to be called, but it isn't.  Not matter what file system I select, clicking browse just opens a standard local file system dialog.  This makes it impossible for another file system to plugin in a different file system browse dialog.
This was not a feature we decided to add for 3.2 as we use the SWT file system dialog and it was going to be a largish API change.
I thought clicking the Browse button would just call the browseFileSystem(...) method on FileSystemContributor? Then it would be up to the file system to decide what kind of dialog to show.  The FileSystemContributor.browseFileSystem method is not currently used anywhere.
We can just use the existing FileSystemContributor#browseFileSystem API

Verified in 20060425</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Build: I20060328-0010

1) Install org.eclipse.ui.examples.filesystem
2) Open the new project wizard
3) Uncheck the default location checkbox
4) Select "In Memory" file system
5) Click "Browse"

I would expect FileSystemContributor.browseFileSystem(String,Shell) to be called, but it isn't.  Not matter what file system I select, clicking browse just opens a standard local file system dialog.  This makes it impossible for another file system to plugin in a different file system browse dialog.
This was not a feature we decided to add for 3.2 as we use the SWT file system dialog and it was going to be a largish API change.
I thought clicking the Browse button would just call the browseFileSystem(...) method on FileSystemContributor? Then it would be up to the file system to decide what kind of dialog to show.  The FileSystemContributor.browseFileSystem method is not currently used anywhere.
We can just use the existing FileSystemContributor#browseFileSystem API

    <WithStack>As a larger test for Analysis I ran all 70 Java tests across jdt.ui . This fails with an OutOfMemoryError.

Details: Unzipped fresh eclipse-SDK-3.2M5a-win32.zip, unzipped fresh tptp.sdk-TPTP-4.2.0-200602281515.zip into the same directory.
Started with -Xmx768m, made a new workspace and imported the org.eclipse.jdt.ui as a Project with Source Folders. 
Made a new Analysis configuration, activated all 70 test, and started the analysis.

It failed even with -Xmx1500m on a 2GB machine, but I had a lot more parts of the Callisto M5 release in my config, and I wanted to ensure no interference from other plugins.

As a comparison, the JDT Java compiler produces ~10000 warnings if most possibilities are enabled using no more than ~90 MB (allocated according to memory gauge).

Checkstyle (plugin 4.1.0.beta3, Sun-Chekcs-Eclipse) pushes the allocation up to almost 700MB (with both the marker view an the graph open), but does a lot more checks (and finds ~600k warnings).

Since I believe that the usefulness of static analysis increases with project size, I consider failing on a large project a serious problem, so I have raised severity to major.

I hope this is the correct component.
70 classes is a tiny set - we routinely test with 5-10K classes.  I'll have to try this particular scenario just to be sure it's fix.

However if you try with with one on of the daily developer builds of TPTP you should be OK
This bug is about running on org.eclipse.jdt.ui, which has about 2.5k classes.

The number 70 is the number of active checks.

If you can run tests on 5-10k classes, I'd be interested in your vmargs for those runs and how many checks you activate for those runs.

Tried this with the current TPTP 4.2 developer build and it worked fine using the default Eclipse VM settings.  There was a problem in the last milestone build but it has been fixed.

Incidentally the test generates 28139 analysis results.

TPTP-4.2.0-200604060100 work for me as well, and like the compiler it doesn't take a noticable amount of memory for its work.

Since there was a bug in the last milestone build (which is what I tested) I think this bug should be closed as fixed (or duplicate of the fixed bug).

    <WithStack>StackPresentation is horribly unclear in that it never explicitly states that a "The presentation doesn't actually parent the widget created by the presentable part. Instead, the part's control and toolbar are parented by the workbench window." (to quote the just-found-by-me EclipseCon presentation).

Just adding some small notes on addPart(), removePart(), selectPart(), the class itself, IPresentablePart.getControl() (whose Javadoc ONLY makes sense when you're in the inner circle on this little secret), etc would be nice.

You don't have to give away the farm here.  Just some small breadcrumbs would prevent people from pulling out their hair.

Thanks!
I take it you are asking for clarification on the javadoc for StackPresentation.  Is there anything else wrt presentations that could be useful.  We have nothing to hide but honestly this stuff is pretty hard to figure out right now and input from people trying to use it is very helpful.


Yes, the "small notes" that I referred to should have been "javadoc".  (And I obviously should have put a ":)" after my last statement :))

Heck, if you can point at the EclipseCon presentation in StackPresentation's class javadoc (http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.ui.examples.presentation/) that would be helpful.

Once one understands that the parts' controls are never actually added to the controls that you create (and you have to do manual layout and all of that) then everything else goes smoothly.  Overall I've pretty happy with the API (well, after some bread crumbs are added to the Javadocs).

The only things that I haven't immediately found at this point all revolve around colors.  How does one:

  1.  Change the color of the sashes between views / editors
  2.  Change the application menu bar color
  3.  Change any remaining application background color (anything that's not #1 and #2).

If these things are or are not done through the presentation APIs then you might just note that in the APIs (and give some hints as to where to go next if the case of "are not done").

Thanks!
The PresentationAPI has been deprecated with the Eclipse 4.x release and it has been replaced with the CSS engine. I therefore close this bugs as WONTFIX. In case your bug report is still valid for the Eclipse 4.4 release, please open a new bug report for it.</WithStack>

Looking at the code, it seems that WorkspacePatcher#parse is (unexpectedly) passed an empty reader in my case. This could suggest a protection on line 111, to check that lr is not null.
It is the second time indeed that I get such behavior in the past months, but it has never been clear how to setup a context that would yield the issue.
I am getting this error as well.  Interestingly I have 3 active version of eclipse 3.2 installed, and they have all developed this problem.  One of the versions has not been updated for a long time, which makes me suspect a java update might be the culprit.

Another option currently is to create multiple JET projects with the individual templates which creates a large workspace and also is very cumbersome since exporting JET projects as jar files is not the most development friendly thing to do.

FYI, I have my task list fast viewed.  I don't know if this effects this bug.

I have the "Filter Completed Tasks" filter enabled on the Tasks View.  When I mark a task complete, I expect it to disappear, but it does not.
Btw, I'm really enjoying Mylar.
You found a regression: our lazier task list refresh was failing to refresh root tasks on some changes.  Now fixed, assuming that you only noticed this with root tasks.  The work-around is to trigger any filter which will cause a full refresh of the list.  

Thanks for the comment#1 :)  Btw, what issue tracker do you guys use?  The experience is way better if it integrates with your issue tracker, although I use local tasks too.
At this point I'm using local tasks because of the project I'm working on.  In the future I fully intend to use the issue tracker integration.  If I can get our admin to move to a newer version.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Using build I20060329-0010, I got an NPE which messages starts with: 
eclipse.buildId=I20060118-0800

This is the case in the Session Data panel of the Event Details dialog, and in the exported log as well. Interestingly enough, other errors of today in the same eclipse show the appropriate build id, including one that is another instance of the same error. I will attach the complete log for reference.
Created attachment 37213
Error log

The first error shows a wrong build id.
I still see this from time to time, also with different buildIds for entries logged during the same Eclipse session.

Could be a problem with .log file rotation. I'm running I20070123-1715, and below are the two most recent entries from the Error Log view. Interestingly, the latest message (with the wrong buildId) contains "This is a continuation of log file C:\e\w\development\.metadata\.bak_0.log".

Error
Sun Jan 28 17:33:11 CET 2007
Problems reported while synchronizing CVS Workspace. 53 of 72 resources were synchronized.

The build id is only logged when we write a !SESSION entry.  This should only be done on the very first log entry for the session and once for each time we rotate a log.  Each time we write the !SESSION entry we simply get the configuration property eclipse.buildId to write the build id to the log.  The only way this could change in the rotated log is if the config property changed since the last time we saved a !SESSION entry.

A log file may contain multiple sessions that use different builds.  In that case each session will record the different build id used.  It seems like this is the case in the attached log.

Log file for comment 2

I got the entries in comment 2 from PDE's Error Log view (opened event details and clicked the copy button). I took a closer look at the .log file and found out that the .log file is actually OK -- it's just the Error Log view that tries to foist a wrong id on me.
Moving to PDE/UI, since the problem is only in the Error Log view.
This annoys me every time I use the Error Log view.

Markus, does this issue still happen to you?
I tried with files attached to bug but everything seems correct.

&gt; Markus, does this issue still happen to you?

I don't use the unreliable copy button any more.
=&gt; I can't say whether this has been fixed in the new Error Log view or not.

To verify whether this has really been fixed, one would have to take the .log from comment 4, put it into a workspace of an old build (3.3 should still have the bug) and check whether this really reproduces the bug. Then do the same with a recent build to verify if it has been fixed.

that's what I did and couldn't reproduce neither in 3.3 or HEAD.

Then let's close this bug. I think I've just been in a situation that would have made this problem appear in 3.3 (log file was rotated and I then started up with a new build), but it was fine now in I20080327-2251.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Using build I20060329-0010, I got an NPE which messages starts with: 
eclipse.buildId=I20060118-0800

This is the case in the Session Data panel of the Event Details dialog, and in the exported log as well. Interestingly enough, other errors of today in the same eclipse show the appropriate build id, including one that is another instance of the same error. I will attach the complete log for reference.

Error log

The first error shows a wrong build id.
I still see this from time to time, also with different buildIds for entries logged during the same Eclipse session.

Could be a problem with .log file rotation. I'm running I20070123-1715, and below are the two most recent entries from the Error Log view. Interestingly, the latest message (with the wrong buildId) contains "This is a continuation of log file C:\e\w\development\.metadata\.bak_0.log".

Error
Sun Jan 28 17:33:11 CET 2007
Problems reported while synchronizing CVS Workspace. 53 of 72 resources were synchronized.

The build id is only logged when we write a !SESSION entry.  This should only be done on the very first log entry for the session and once for each time we rotate a log.  Each time we write the !SESSION entry we simply get the configuration property eclipse.buildId to write the build id to the log.  The only way this could change in the rotated log is if the config property changed since the last time we saved a !SESSION entry.

A log file may contain multiple sessions that use different builds.  In that case each session will record the different build id used.  It seems like this is the case in the attached log.

Log file for comment 2

I got the entries in comment 2 from PDE's Error Log view (opened event details and clicked the copy button). I took a closer look at the .log file and found out that the .log file is actually OK -- it's just the Error Log view that tries to foist a wrong id on me.
Moving to PDE/UI, since the problem is only in the Error Log view.
This annoys me every time I use the Error Log view.

&gt; This annoys me every time I use the Error Log view.

Markus, does this issue still happen to you?
I tried with files attached to bug but everything seems correct.

&gt; Markus, does this issue still happen to you?

I don't use the unreliable copy button any more.
=&gt; I can't say whether this has been fixed in the new Error Log view or not.

To verify whether this has really been fixed, one would have to take the .log from comment 4, put it into a workspace of an old build (3.3 should still have the bug) and check whether this really reproduces the bug. Then do the same with a recent build to verify if it has been fixed.

    <WithStack>* The action continues to show sub-menu (renderings that can be added) after the debug session is terminated and removed from the Debug View.

* If the action is shown in the Variables View before the sample debugger is loaded, the action does not create sub-menu.  The action is enabled, but it does not add sub-menu to allow users to add renderings.

* Same problem exists if the action is contributed to the editor.  The action does not provide submenu if the editor menu is brought up before the sample plugin is loaded.
The action continues to show sub-menu because:
* the action was not disabled by sample's add memory rendering target
* the action does not clear its action delegate when there is no active debug context.

The other two problems is are problems with the sample itself.  When contributing this action to a view or an editor, the action must be contributed with "PULLDOWN" style.  Otherwise, the action will be treated as just a push button and setting a menu creator will not help.

Updated sample to fix the other two problems.  
Fixed in AddMemoryRenderingActionDelegate.

If the current debug context is null, set its action delegate to null as well.

    <WithStack>The undo history is cleared when a shape is copied on a GMF diagram.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Create a new logic example diagram
2. Add a LED to the diagram; observe that "Undo Create LED" is available from the edit menu.
3. Select the LED and choose 'Edit-&gt;Copy' from the diagram context menu.
4. Observe that "Undo Create LED" is no longer available from the edit menu

Since the copy does not make any changes that invalidate the commands on the undo history, the history should not be cleared.  I should still be able to "Undo Create LED" after selecting 'Copy'.
Fixed. The undo history is no longer cleared when 'Edit--&gt;Copy' is selected.

    <WithStack>Hi,
I use CDT for editing mozilla. I've disabled the scanner, and all the builds, and every once in a while, the UI freezes while some heavy duty disk scanning is going on. Looks like I am not the only one with this problem, see
http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.tools.cdt/msg09874.html

How to fix it? 

You could have a UI preference for "Keep resources in sync manually", with an "Out of date" marker that appears on the project. Even better, notify the user when the auto sync is taking too long, and ask them for manual. Personally, I do not care about resources being out of sync, I sync manually all the time.
Hmm. Thanks for the link to the newsgroup message. I unfortunately never seem to have time to go read the newsgroup.

I'm not sure why the MakeBuilder is refreshing the resources. I would have thought that the Eclipse platform would take care of that. Are we double refreshing? I'm sure we can find a way to optimize this.
The builder does a refresh so that it can see all of the generated artifacts that resulted from the build.  Since we don't really know which parts of the project might have changed, we refresh everything.

I think the platform leaves it up to the builder to do all the refreshing (the builder is the only one that would know what to refresh, if anything), so I would be surprised if there was more than one refresh going on other than if you have "refresh automatically" turned on.
We could obtain the list of generated files/dirs for the Managed Build projects using the new Build Model.
I'll take a look at how it could be done for the MBS in the best way and whether or not it can be fixed for the 3.1

Mikhail
After a quick look at this problem from the MBS point of view, looks like we can not always guarantee that the list of resources to be rebuilt calculated by the Build Model will always be completely the same as the list of resources really generated by the external builder (e.g. make might rebuild some resources that the build model treats as “don’t rebuild”). More than that, the project refresh for the managed builder does not seem to be a bottleneck. E.g. makefile generation for the mozilla-size project is processed several times longer than a project refresh.
In this sense the Build Model calculation in pair with Internal Builder requires much less time than the Buildfile Generation and External Builder invocation. More than that we do have a full control over each tool invocation in the Internal Builder and we do know the result of each invocation and the set of resources generated with each tool invocation.

So I’m not going to make any changes in the refresh mechanism for the external builder usage for now.
As for the Internal Builder, I have implemented the smart refresh mechanism that performs a refresh of necessary resources after each tool invocation.

Regarding the standard make builder, looks like there is no way to perform any kind of “smart” refresh since we never know what resources are being generated while the build process. The only solution I could think of is to allow users disable/enable a refresh.

Bugs still assigned to the inbox can not have the target milestone set. If someone is really going to fix this in 3.1, please assign it to yourself.
I know this issue is pretty old now but it seems like the appropriate place to comment.

I was getting frustrated with the time between an external build completing and Eclipse populating the Problems view and it was down to the project refresh as described by this issue.

I've implemented the fix mentioned (http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.tools.cdt/msg09874.html) and this is perfect for my needs.

In our case we know that the build won't modify anything that we would want Eclipse to refresh so I'm pretty happy with it.

It would be really nice if it was a configuration option.

Patch Proposed to fix this issue

Hi,

This patch contains the part of code which starts a refreshLocal after a compilation commented.
It must be applied in project org.eclipse.cdt.make, on top directory.

Could you apply it, because on big project on NFS shared FS, the refresh local takes several long minutes !

thanks.
I am currently evaluating using the cdt for a huge project with an external builder. 

This bug turns my workflow into a total workstumble. Its impact is so severe that it is an absolute killer for using eclipse/cdt (which is very sad considering all the nice features it offers).

I can think of the following solutions to this bug:

- Don't reinvent the whell: Use fsevents (osx) and inotify (linux) if available and stat only as a fallback to see which files have changed. 
Pros: Gigantic performance improvements if available. 
Cons: Platform dependent.

- Give users a preference to sync manually on external builds and warn them about the consequences. 
Pros: Easy to implement, huge improvement in a common use case (starting a debug session w/o changing the code after the last build).
Cons: May have issues. Hacky. Only defers syncing after builds to some later time.

- Most build tools/makefiles I have come across output or can be tweaked to output which artifacts have been produced or modified. So cdt could offer an option "trust output of build script" and scan the build output for potential changes. If this is too much work, it could at least offer an api to be notified by the external builder which artifacts have changed. 
Pros: Platform independent.
Cons: Requires dev-time, both on cdt and client side.

- The cdt could parse a return value of the build script to see if the project is up to date or if things changed.
Pros: Easy to implement, huge improvement in a common use case (starting a debug session w/o changing the code after the last build).
Cons: No improvement after real builds.

- The cdt could assume that builds are deterministic: If none of the sources changes, it need not build.
Pros: Huge improvement in a common use case (starting a debug session w/o changing the code after the last build).
Cons: No clue if this is a cdt responsibility or an eclipse one.

No, because this blindly breaks the originally intended behaviour of wanting to automatically refresh the resources.  If this is going to change, it will have to be a user-configurable option.

Possible, but won't work for cases where your build script's output is not recognized.  Refreshing the workspace works regardless of builder, so that feature can't go away.

We have an option for this now that will be available in CDT 6.0.  Try out a nightly build if you are eager.

Could you give me a pointer where "Updating Project" actually occurred? I tried the brute force patch by Paul Ventadoux, but Eclipse is still "Updating Project", even though it seemed to be faster. In any case, is there a wiki/faq or the like that describes how to develop/debug cdt within eclipse?

&gt; implemented by the Eclipse platform, so it would fall to them to implement
&gt; something like that.

The platform provides an extension point to contribute custom refresh providers for the 'automatically refresh' case. By default, the platform comes only with an optimized provider for win32 platforms, for all others it falls back to regular file system polling which does not scale well. Unfortunately the win32 provider does not scale well, either, because it monitors changes only on the project level. I.e. every change in the project tree leads to a complete project refresh.

Initially there was also a native refresh provider solution for Linux using FAM (File Alteration Monitor), but because of problems it has been dropped (see bug 52859).
BTW, there is also an optimized auto-refresh provider for the ClearCase MVFS file system.

The auto-refresh feature could be a way to avoid the explicit refresh after a build, provided it works reliably and scales to large projects.
So, creating auto-refresh providers optimized for the different platforms would be a nice contribution.

More information: http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/auto_refresh.html
Any news on this? Is it possible to just add some kind of checkbox (with warning that avoid refreshing is too bad thing)
Also project settings contains "Output Location" list. As a workaround Eclipse may assume that all modified (generated) during build files will be in one of "Output Location" directories. This should improve performance.
I think I may look at this for 7.0

There have been conflicting opinions on the scope of the refresh.  I think that's a separate issue that deserves its own bug.  I'll clone this to track that.
Hi, I work with a large group at Xerox that is trying to switch over to eclipse as our preferred C++ IDE but this bug is preventing our larger projects from making the switch. I have tried the work-around referenced in the above mentioned newsgroup but I noticed no change in behavior when building... the build completes quickly but then eclipse stalls at "Updating project" for a considerable amount of time.

Our build system does not add files that need to be indexed so if that is what "updating project" is doing, turning it off would be a viable solution for us. Anything would be better than sitting at a stalled eclipse window for upwards of 2 minutes.

I really need a workaround for this... can anybody help me and/or tell me if there is a nightly build out there that has a fix?

I really appreciate any help I can get.

Disables project refresh when auto refresh is on.

Hi Chris.
I was wondering if  you were still planning on looking at this issue for 7.0?
It has also become a problem for us and we are trying to figure out how to work around it.

Thanks

For reference, the cloned bug is bug 278257
This makes working with CMake CDT generator in a project with any reasonable size next to impossible.

Other cross-platform build tree generators ( Bakefile, premake4 ) would probably be similarly affected.

Well it's obviously too late for 7.0, but I'd like to look at this as part of the scalability work I intend to do for 8.0.

An additional thought is that we could possibly have more settings than just a toggle.

E.g. "Only refresh folders X, Y, and Z after a build"

Add option for refresh after build

I had a hard time figuring out from the two seconds I looked at the patch (sorry), but what is the default behavior? refresh or not?

To restart Chris's point, have we considered, or do we not already, only refresh the output folders. Wouldn't this make more sense than just turning it off?

I agree that it's more likely that user will want to restrict the scope of the refresh rather than avoid it altogether.

In the scenario where the output folder is the root of the project, recursively refreshing the output folder is probably not desirable.  Depending on how granular we wanted to get with the configurable scope of the refrsh, that scenario could be handled by just refreshing the final output file, or a list of binary files selected by the user.

Really I think the only benefit to have a setting to not refresh at all is that it's easier/faster to implement.  Not refreshing at all can be expressed as a special case of specifying a refresh scope, where the scope is empty.  The default behaviour would be to refresh the project root.  So upon further thought, personally I think that ought to be where we head.

I'm hoping to throw some non-functional mockups together for the Summit that we can discuss.

Output folders sounds good. There is Output Locations tab in project properties where one could add more folders or remove. Perhaps it can serve as the configurable scope and perhaps could allow add binary files as well. What purpose does Output Location serve now?

Now, it restricts the scope of the binary parser. So this would be a natural extension to that since it's purpose is to reflect where to find the build results.

The one problem I think we have is that the output location is per project, not per configuration. Ideally each config could have a different output folder to further restrict the refresh to the current config.

Refresh output folders

This patch refreshes only output folders and was inspired by the code in BinaryRunner. By default, the project folder is set in the output folders. It is still per project instead of per configuration.

It is definitely possible to specify the output location per configuration. I do it for all of my projects.

I think they just stack at the project level. For example, if you add foo in Debug and bar in Release, and you do cproject.getOutputEntries, it will return both foo and bar. But they are separated in each config in the UI, I'm not sure how.
Is there something in IConfiguration or somewhere to get the output folder? You would be able to use that since the common builder knows what configuration is building.

&gt; Ok, I must be blind because I can't find this tab for the life of me.
That one displays only if "Generate Makefiles automatically" on "C/C++ Build" is unchecked. You are not entitled to see that when build system manages that for you.

&gt; &gt; There is Output Locations tab in project properties
&gt; &gt; where one could add more folders or remove. Perhaps it can serve as the
&gt; &gt; configurable scope and perhaps could allow add binary files as well. What
&gt; &gt; purpose does Output Location serve now?
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I must be blind because I can't find this tab for the life of me.

I think it's only available for makefile projects (i.e. C/C++ Build &gt; Generate Makefiles automatically is disabled). For managed build the output directories are set automagically.

I'm not sure this is the right fix, at the very least this should be configurable. We have some ideas on making this better -- I think it would be good to cover at the summit.

I'll add the following requirements as well:

- There needs to be a way to express that you wish a folder to be refreshed recursively, or not.  Right now it is just a list of folders, with exclusion patterns.  It's possible to express not wanting to refresh recursively by making an exlusion pattern that is equivalent to ./*/, but that's cumbersome.

- There should be an easy way to include/exclude known source extensions (taken from content types) by just clicking a checkbox rather than having to type your own exclusion pattern.  Some people generate code as part of their build process so they need the flexibility of refreshing source artifacts.  Others output binaries to the same location of their source and don't generate code, so they must be able to exclude sources easily.

Come to think of it, really we should let them easily add/remove any content type as an exclusion.  This stuff will get reused for UPC and Fortran, and who knows what other tools.  So, a simple checkbox on its own is not going to cut it.

Configurable? Do you mean not only have it for External builder? Or something similar to what Chris suggested?

Those are fair requirements. I hope you (or we?) have the time to accomplish this for 8.0. Looking at the history of the bug, I can't help but be a little concerned that it might slip yet again. I look forward to hearing from the CDT summit about this important issue.
(In reply to comment #43)
&gt; Configurable? Do you mean not only have it for External builder? Or something
&gt; similar to what Chris suggested?

Well my main concern is that you're only refreshing the output directory(ies) at DEPTH_ONE.  If you do this then you're forcing the user to add every single directory in the build tree to the output dir list? This would break our makefile projects, for example, which have a build tree of hundreds of directories mirroring the source tree with build artifacts scattered about the tree. This is why I think this should be configurable.

&gt; Looking at the history of the bug, I can't help but be a little
&gt; concerned that it might slip yet again...

I understand the feeling. We've had more pressing issues with making Managedbuild be correct and consistent which have kept us busy for a bit...

I think that, for performance on slow filesystems, we shouldn't do _any_ resource refresh inline with the build. This only delays the next build, keeps the resource tree locked, etc.  Instead it would be better to add a small bit of API to core.resources to allow requesting aysnchronous Refresh resources: bug 313673.

I agree.  The problem however is that we can't possibly enumerate ahead of time all the filesystems that are slow.

Even within a single filesystem, it may be the case that some stores are slow to refresh while others aren't.  Take the RSE EFS provider for example.  It can target both local and remote files... the local refreshes would be "fast" compared to the remote ones.  Although personally, I would make the choice there to just treat RSE as a whole as "slow" to refresh.

Putting my IBM hat on, for our product needs, it's sufficient for us to be able to programmatically set the refresh policy on a project while we are creating it from our IBM wizard.  Putting on my RDT hat, we can do the same thing there.

Putting my Eclipse hat back on, it might make sense to have an extension point that maps policies to EFS providers.  That would take care of the case where people are using a slow EFS provider but not using any specialized tooling over and above vanilla CDT.  That can still be tricky though, as we may have users downstream that don't like the choices we make if we provide some extensions to that extension point ourselves.  So I think maybe if we create said extension point, we ought not extend it ourselves in CDT.

You are right... asynchronous refreshes would make this a lot simpler.
That's a great point Chris. I'd be happy if we declare that out of the box, CDT assumes fast file systems. If you are working with a slow one, you need to install a plugin that tells the CDT that that file system is slow and under what conditions.

We rely too often on users setting preferences making it their problem instead of finding automated ways of helping them when we need help. And when they don't need help, we need to keep out of the way.

No, the visitor goes through all sub directories, DEPTH_ONE is used to prevent multiple refreshes on the same sub directories. I just noticed a problem with the last patch, the visitor didn't leave the directory when the exclusion pattern was matched, this is fixed in the new patch.

Hi Chris. How are things progressing? Was this topic discussed at the summit?
Sorry if I lost track - would we have an option to disable auto-refresh altogether? For make projects it is not really needed...

design document (work in progress)

Attaching my design document for review.  It is still a work in progress and many sections are not filled in yet.  However I wanted to get feedback on the basic idea before I proceed much further.

Without going through the entire rationale (the rationale is lengthy, so read it in the design document), the basic idea of the design is to provide a new UI and underlying model to handle the post-build refresh, as the existing Output Locations system does not really work for what we want to do.  The new system will provide for the inclusion/exclusion of particular resources according to various nested rules, e.g. "refresh the entire tree under project root, EXCEPT C/C++ source files and header files, EXCEPT do a refresh on /myproject/somefolder/generated_file.cpp"

James, I would particularly like your feedback on the proposed platform change I have in mind before I file a RFE against Platform Resources.
Hi Chris, thanks for working on this. I read most of the document. We have multiple generated source files in different folders which always have the same name, say "generated.cpp". It would be great to be able to include all of those without having to specify them individually. Would this be covered in phase 2? I see Resource exceptions but I'm not sure if "generated.cpp" would work as "*/generated.cpp"?

Interesting that you mention that.  Originally I had come up with a "Resource Name Pattern" exclusion that would allow for just the scenario you mention, but then I thought maybe I was overdoing it and that no one would use it because 99% of the time all they cared about was specifying the file extension.  I guess you've proved me wrong :-)  I can re-add the requirement.  File extension exclusions would then just be a special case of resource name exclusion.
Interesting proposal Chris.

With resource filters there's already some precedent for filtering resources - see how children are filtered during UnifiedTree#getLocalList(...). One could imagine hooking a filter to refresh local to prevent stat'ing some files which don't match a certain spec.

Taking a small step back, it looks like this proposal only addresses post-build refresh, invoked at end of CDT build.  Is RefreshScopeManager in CDT on top of core.resoruces? If so, there will still be issues with Project-level refresh, and/or auto-refresh unless the refresh behaviour is specified in core.resources, right?  

It's worth bearing in mind a few platform bugs on the same issue:
   Bug 281387 Exclude directories from refresh
   Bug 244979 / Bug 91432 Lazy Refresh
   Bug 313673 API to perform async refresh 

A few other comments:
  3.5.4 It must be easy to exclude files based on Eclipse content types. 
This is going to be hard, right?  To know the content type (without using the extension) the first few bytes of the file are read which will be more expensive than a simple stat...?

  3.6.1 A post-build refresh on a typical 5,000 – 10,000 file remote project should take no more than one minute.
One minute is a _very_ long time. I get fed up with waiting 20s for a post-build refresh. 
I think any solution should require user isn't blocked from continuing work. i.e. workspace should not remain locked for more than 1-2s at any one time.  If we don't do this users will stick to emacs...

The semantics of out-of-sync files aren't clear to me.  They'll be visible when iterating of the resource hierarchy, but if opened editors will report out-of-sync (though we could fix this).  By not keeping them eagerly in-sync team providers, resource change listeners, etc. won't be able to update their models.  This may be fine, but does bear thinking about.

Perhaps we should discuss this and potential solutions on the core.resources call and bugzillas?
I looked over the proposal and it looks good for me.

Just a couple of thoughts which I am not sure how to fit in the picture:
- There is bug 305474 asking for refresh *before* the build, and another bug somewhere in CDT about refreshing after pre-build step which could possibly generate source files for internal builder. Maybe a checkbox could be added?
- There is "Refresh automatically" preference in General-&gt;Workspace. Some might argue that this flag should be used, i.e. if it is enabled then refresh should be kicked off in background. If disabled then the user indicated the desire to do any refresh manually. Similarly to the argument utilized in bug 14867.

&gt; see how children are filtered during UnifiedTree#getLocalList(...). One could

I will take a look at that.

&gt; Taking a small step back, it looks like this proposal only addresses post-build
&gt; refresh, invoked at end of CDT build.  Is RefreshScopeManager in CDT on top of
&gt; core.resoruces? If so, there will still be issues with Project-level refresh,
&gt; and/or auto-refresh unless the refresh behaviour is specified in
&gt; core.resources, right?  

Yes, this is on top of core.resources, so it would not affect anything to do with auto-refreh.  As far as project-level refresh (I assume you mean the one after the build, not a manual one?), the idea is that the platform gives us a way to discover new children without stat'ing everything, then if there are exclusions present in the model, we actually break up the project level refresh and invoke our own refreshes that only stat the resources we want.

One problem I am worried about though is making sure the stat'ing is done efficiently.  The straightforward approach is to visit the resources, apply our exclusion criteria, and then individually refresh each remaining resource.  That might be inefficient compared to doing one big request or a series of batched requests where you get many of the stats in one transaction.  EFS has a way of doing batch refreshes... IFileSystem.fetchFileTree(IFileStore, IProgressMonitor).  When you call that you get a whole chunk of the tree in one go.  This would circumvent that, although I'm not entirely sure it's being used much by EFS providers anyway.

&gt; It's worth bearing in mind a few platform bugs on the same issue:
&gt;    Bug 281387 Exclude directories from refresh
&gt;    Bug 244979 / Bug 91432 Lazy Refresh
&gt;    Bug 313673 API to perform async refresh

Yeah I think those will help some, but we'll still need this for a few reasons:

- Refreshing more than you need to still consumes bandwidth/CPU resources that might either be shared with other users or other operations that you yourself are trying to accomplish.

- You might literally be paying for said resources, so doing more than you need to costs money.

- Refreshing more than you need to, even asynchronously, might still make the user wait to do something longer than they need to.  E.g. they've built their project and wish to debug the resulting binary, but have to wait for the binary to show up in the tree before they can debug it.

So, I see this all these improvements as complementary.

&gt; A few other comments:
&gt;   3.5.4 It must be easy to exclude files based on Eclipse content types. 
&gt; This is going to be hard, right?  To know the content type (without using the
&gt; extension) the first few bytes of the file are read which will be more
&gt; expensive than a simple stat...?

Yes, if your content type is based on the file contents then this is going to get expensive.  If the check can be done based on extension alone then it never reads the file contents to determine the content type.  I don't foresee that as coming up often enough.  If it's problematic enough a user could use a resource name pattern exclusion instead.  E.g. if you have some content type that is a type of .xml file and the only way to know the true content type is to read the contents of the file, then maybe you might just tell the system to refresh all *.xml files rather than telling it to refresh only that specific content type, as I would imagine doing the stat for the refresh is cheaper than doing the open and then reading a few bytes.

&gt;   3.6.1 A post-build refresh on a typical 5,000 – 10,000 file remote project
&gt; should take no more than one minute.
&gt; One minute is a _very_ long time. I get fed up with waiting 20s for a

&gt; i.e. workspace should not remain locked for more than 1-2s at any one time.  If
&gt; we don't do this users will stick to emacs...

Good point.  I probably should have been clearer.  The requirement wasn't intended to be a metric of how long any given resource is locked or how the refreshes are broken up, or whether the user can do anything while the refresh is happening.  It was meant as a goal to measure how much time is spent refreshing in total.

&gt; The semantics of out-of-sync files aren't clear to me.  They'll be visible when
&gt; iterating of the resource hierarchy, but if opened editors will report
&gt; out-of-sync (though we could fix this).  By not keeping them eagerly in-sync
&gt; team providers, resource change listeners, etc. won't be able to update their
&gt; models.  This may be fine, but does bear thinking about.

&gt; call and bugzillas?

Yep, I'm happy to discuss all of this.  When is the next core.resources call?

&gt; somewhere in CDT about refreshing after pre-build step which could possibly
&gt; generate source files for internal builder. Maybe a checkbox could be added?

The refresh before the build scares me a bit if the platform is going to handle it (Bug 305474 is filed against platform resources).  I think each builder ought to be in charge of its own refreshing.

Refreshing after the pre-build step is something I hadn't thought of but I'm not against it so long as it's configurable (most projects don't need to refresh at that point).  We could just add an option to refresh or not at this phase, and have it obey the same refresh policy we use for the post-build refresh.  Do you think that would be sufficient?  Having multiple totally different refresh policies is something I'd like to avoid if at all possible, but if it is truly required then I'll go there.

&gt; - There is "Refresh automatically" preference in General-&gt;Workspace. Some might
&gt; argue that this flag should be used, i.e. if it is enabled then refresh should
&gt; be kicked off in background. If disabled then the user indicated the desire to
&gt; do any refresh manually. Similarly to the argument utilized in bug 14867.

Others will argue though that they don't want to wait for an automatic refresh to kick off "when it feels like it."
Bug 334930 filed against platform resources to track platform changes in support of refreshing new children without doing attribute checks on all children.

We've got a working implementation of Phase One coming in M7 (currently in HEAD).  Try it out.  You can specify a list of resources to refresh, and you can specify Resource Exclusions.  Note that the refresh policy is not used by the internal builder by design, as it refreshes resources as it executes individual build steps.

One thing I intend to change is the way the data is stored.  Right now it's stored in a persistent resource property, but I didn't realize that those are stored in the workspace, not in the project.  I want the refresh data to be  part of the project itself, and team shared.

There is still a bunch of code cleanup as well to be done.  Missing javadoc, etc.

RefreshScopeManager exceptions patch

I just updated my CDT install to 8.0.0.201104291533 (Build #676)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create two CDT projects. (Do not open the first project properties in between). Or open an existing workspace with more than one CDT project.
2. Open one of the project properties.
3. Click OK

The first one is very serious since it prevents saving project properties. I'm going to commit simple workarounds for now so that M7 is usable.

I hadn't made the RefreshScopeManager threadsafe yet as I wasn't sure we really needed to, but I guess your findings say that we do.  I'll make the required changes...

Sorry, I'm a bonehead.  It had nothing to do with threadsafeness.  You can't modify the contents of a map while you iterate over its keyset.  Duh.

Should hopefully be fixed now for real.  I was able to reproduce your problem after trying enough times, now I can't after the changes.

Still TODO:

- Redo where the settings are stored, so they are team shared.
- Fix the scheduling rule for the refresh.  Right now it locks the workspace.  Won't be hard to fix, I just need to set the right scheduling rule.
- Code cleanup
The refresh scope data is now serialized/deserialized to/from the C project description.

Also fixed a stack overflow issue with loading.

Also moved ResourceExclusion and friends to internal packages.

Still TODO:  alter scheduling rules for the refresh operation, more code cleanup.

(In reply to comment #101)
&gt; The refresh is now scheduled on the resources to be refreshed.

The rule used for the scheduling isn't right.

You need to get the refresh rule from the resource rule factory (but this would be overkill...). Easiest fix is just to run this with a 'null' scheduling rule as you had before.  The workspace will already acquire the scheduling rules needed for running the refresh. This will be done at the individual resource layer so will allow concurrent modification in the tree and minmize the scope of the locking while the refresh is in progress.

Not quite true... I was using this:

org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspace.run(IWorkspaceRunnable, IProgressMonitor)

"This is a convenience method, fully equivalent to: workspace.run(action, workspace.getRoot(), IWorkspace.AVOID_UPDATE, monitor);"

I'll try a null rule though...
(In reply to comment #104)
Ah woops.  Out of interest I wonder why you're doing the refresh in an IWorkspaceRunnable rather than just having a method:
  RefreshScopeManager.getDefault().refresh(IProject) 
The build is already run in a workspace operation, so there's no additional advantage to nesting another one within it.
A few other comments on RefreshScopeManager:
 1) Delta: Change the settings, close the project &amp; re-open the project, the Refresh Policy tab is empty (maybe this is 3?).
 2) loadSettings(...): 
   IResource resource = workspaceRoot.findMember(resourcePath);
   if (resource == null) {
        // error
   }
   This looks wrong: after a clean, or for a freshly imported project, the build directory may not exist so this very like will be null, right, so the RSM will miss that resource forever more?
 3) #persistSettings looks wrong. It looks like its persisting *all* the refresh settings into the passed in ICProjectDescription.  Presumably it only wants to set them for the project = projectDescription.getProject();
 4) When processing the resource delta, it returns true for all ! instanceof Project which will cause the visitor to run over the full delta, which is inefficient
 5) Using #getProjectToResourcesMap() to initialize the 3 maps: RSM is singleton, so perhaps just create them at construction.
 6) Locking: imo it would be better to use thread-safe data structures (Collections.synchronize... or Concurrent....()), rather than making each method synchronized. Coarse locking makes it difficult to reason about potential deadlocks (and in this case doesn't seem to be needed).
 7) API Visibility: All this stuff is publicly visible. Can it live in an internal package so we can minimize breakage in the future e.g. org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.resources?  MBS can be friends of cdt.core so should be able to see all the *.internal.* stuff without issue or warning.
 8) Tidy: As the classes are new can you sort methods &amp; format code to standard

This was to allow for moving the refresh to a Job in some cases, for bug 330360

&gt; A few other comments on RefreshScopeManager:
&gt;  1) Delta: Change the settings, close the project &amp; re-open the project, the
&gt; Refresh Policy tab is empty (maybe this is 3?).

Crap, it was working before... Yeah I think the move to the project description broke this.

&gt;  2) loadSettings(...): 
&gt;    IResource resource = workspaceRoot.findMember(resourcePath);
&gt;    if (resource == null) {
&gt;         // error
&gt;    }
&gt;    This looks wrong: after a clean, or for a freshly imported project, the
&gt; build directory may not exist so this very like will be null, right, so the RSM
&gt; will miss that resource forever more?

Good point... I forgot that findMember() won't return a handle if the resource doesn't exist.  Arg.  I can't seem to find a convenient API for this either.  All the handle based APIs require you know up front if you want an IFolder or an IFile.  I guess I'll have to store the resource type when serializing...

&gt;  3) #persistSettings looks wrong. It looks like its persisting *all* the
&gt; refresh settings into the passed in ICProjectDescription.  Presumably it only
&gt; wants to set them for the project = projectDescription.getProject();

Yeah... an artifact of moving to the project description stuff.  Will fix... this will cause problems if each project has differet settings.

&gt;  4) When processing the resource delta, it returns true for all ! instanceof
&gt; Project which will cause the visitor to run over the full delta, which is
&gt; inefficient

Will fix...

&gt;  5) Using #getProjectToResourcesMap() to initialize the 3 maps: RSM is
&gt; singleton, so perhaps just create them at construction.

Yeah I intended to fix that as a part of the cleanup.

&gt;  6) Locking: imo it would be better to use thread-safe data structures
&gt; (Collections.synchronize... or Concurrent....()), rather than making each
&gt; method synchronized. Coarse locking makes it difficult to reason about
&gt; potential deadlocks (and in this case doesn't seem to be needed).

I'll look into it..

&gt;  7) API Visibility: All this stuff is publicly visible. Can it live in an
&gt; internal package so we can minimize breakage in the future e.g.
&gt; org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.resources?  MBS can be friends of cdt.core so
&gt; should be able to see all the *.internal.* stuff without issue or warning.

No, because RDT needs to use this stuff too, so that the RemoteMakeBuilder can use it.

Everything is marked (or should be marked...) provisional.

&gt;  8) Tidy: As the classes are new can you sort methods &amp; format code to standard

I can do a sort... I format to 120 characters already typically but I'll do a mass format during the cleanup to be sure I didn't miss anything.  Formatting to 80 characters results in a mess so I prefer to stick to 120.
(In reply to comment #108)
&gt; No, because RDT needs to use this stuff too, so that the RemoteMakeBuilder can
&gt; use it.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything is marked (or should be marked...) provisional.

Ah, Ok.  Presumably the RemoteMakeBuilder is just calling one API method: #getRefreshRunnable() or is it using other API? 

Even if this is provisional, having all the implementation exposed may lead API users to make incorrect assumptions by reading the implementation.

The ideal would be do have an Interface which exposes the API contract. 

Alternatively, you can copy RSM to InternalRSM under *.internal.*, have the visible RSM extend InternalRSM and just replace the methods that you want to be visible.  It's then very clear to consumers what API is what the contract is, maybe something like:
 
public class RefreshScopeManager extend InternalRefreshScopeManager {
 /**
  * Document me
  */
 @Override
 public static RefreshScopeManager getInstance() {
   return super.getInstance();
 } 

 /**
  * Document me
  */
 @Override
 public IWorkspaceRunnable getRefreshRunnable(final IProject project) {
    return super.getRefreshRunnable(project);
 }
}

That way you minimize how much documentation you need to write, and makes it very clear what people can rely on.  Clearly it doesn't stop them using the internal public methods, but it does hide the complexity of the implementation: synchronization - persistence - data structures, etc. ;)

&gt; I can do a sort... I format to 120 characters already typically but I'll do a
&gt; mass format during the cleanup to be sure I didn't miss anything.  Formatting
&gt; to 80 characters results in a mess so I prefer to stick to 120.

Personally I'm happy about long lines, there are just some whitespace oddities...
Scheduling rule is fixed.

Fixed, at least for Project, File, and Folder resources.  For other resources, I don't know of a way to create the right type of object, so I just use findMember() as a fallback.  Note that Groups will work properly because they are virtual, so if they don't exist, refreshing won't recreate them.

This is all still pending.

Bug 133881 - Make refreshing after building optional - UI changes

[*] Messages.properties 1.8 http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.cdt/all/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/Messages.properties?root=Tools_Project&amp;r1=1.7&amp;r2=1.8
There are still various cleanup tasks to complete, but these will have to wait for post-Indigo, as I don't want to destabilize anything.

Since the main request (making refreshes optional) is complete, I will resolve this as FIXED and we'll deal with any new bugs/changes separately.
Two questions:

1) Is this feature available in the nightly build of CDT. Ie. http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/builds/8.0.0/I.I201106081058/index.html

2) Is there any user documentation available on this feature?

Thanks!

Yes it's available in Indigo (CDT 8).  That build should have it.

Unfortunately we are somewhat tardy with the documentation.  It will be coming later.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Hi,
I use CDT for editing mozilla. I've disabled the scanner, and all the builds, and every once in a while, the UI freezes while some heavy duty disk scanning is going on. Looks like I am not the only one with this problem, see
http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.tools.cdt/msg09874.html

How to fix it? 

You could have a UI preference for "Keep resources in sync manually", with an "Out of date" marker that appears on the project. Even better, notify the user when the auto sync is taking too long, and ask them for manual. Personally, I do not care about resources being out of sync, I sync manually all the time.
Hmm. Thanks for the link to the newsgroup message. I unfortunately never seem to have time to go read the newsgroup.

I'm not sure why the MakeBuilder is refreshing the resources. I would have thought that the Eclipse platform would take care of that. Are we double refreshing? I'm sure we can find a way to optimize this.
The builder does a refresh so that it can see all of the generated artifacts that resulted from the build.  Since we don't really know which parts of the project might have changed, we refresh everything.

I think the platform leaves it up to the builder to do all the refreshing (the builder is the only one that would know what to refresh, if anything), so I would be surprised if there was more than one refresh going on other than if you have "refresh automatically" turned on.
We could obtain the list of generated files/dirs for the Managed Build projects using the new Build Model.
I'll take a look at how it could be done for the MBS in the best way and whether or not it can be fixed for the 3.1

Mikhail
After a quick look at this problem from the MBS point of view, looks like we can not always guarantee that the list of resources to be rebuilt calculated by the Build Model will always be completely the same as the list of resources really generated by the external builder (e.g. make might rebuild some resources that the build model treats as “don’t rebuild”). More than that, the project refresh for the managed builder does not seem to be a bottleneck. E.g. makefile generation for the mozilla-size project is processed several times longer than a project refresh.
In this sense the Build Model calculation in pair with Internal Builder requires much less time than the Buildfile Generation and External Builder invocation. More than that we do have a full control over each tool invocation in the Internal Builder and we do know the result of each invocation and the set of resources generated with each tool invocation.

So I’m not going to make any changes in the refresh mechanism for the external builder usage for now.
As for the Internal Builder, I have implemented the smart refresh mechanism that performs a refresh of necessary resources after each tool invocation.

Regarding the standard make builder, looks like there is no way to perform any kind of “smart” refresh since we never know what resources are being generated while the build process. The only solution I could think of is to allow users disable/enable a refresh.

Bugs still assigned to the inbox can not have the target milestone set. If someone is really going to fix this in 3.1, please assign it to yourself.
I know this issue is pretty old now but it seems like the appropriate place to comment.

I was getting frustrated with the time between an external build completing and Eclipse populating the Problems view and it was down to the project refresh as described by this issue.

I've implemented the fix mentioned (http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.tools.cdt/msg09874.html) and this is perfect for my needs.

In our case we know that the build won't modify anything that we would want Eclipse to refresh so I'm pretty happy with it.

It would be really nice if it was a configuration option.

Patch Proposed to fix this issue

Hi,

This patch contains the part of code which starts a refreshLocal after a compilation commented.
It must be applied in project org.eclipse.cdt.make, on top directory.

Could you apply it, because on big project on NFS shared FS, the refresh local takes several long minutes !

thanks.
I am currently evaluating using the cdt for a huge project with an external builder. 

This bug turns my workflow into a total workstumble. Its impact is so severe that it is an absolute killer for using eclipse/cdt (which is very sad considering all the nice features it offers).

I can think of the following solutions to this bug:

- Don't reinvent the whell: Use fsevents (osx) and inotify (linux) if available and stat only as a fallback to see which files have changed. 
Pros: Gigantic performance improvements if available. 
Cons: Platform dependent.

- Give users a preference to sync manually on external builds and warn them about the consequences. 
Pros: Easy to implement, huge improvement in a common use case (starting a debug session w/o changing the code after the last build).
Cons: May have issues. Hacky. Only defers syncing after builds to some later time.

- Most build tools/makefiles I have come across output or can be tweaked to output which artifacts have been produced or modified. So cdt could offer an option "trust output of build script" and scan the build output for potential changes. If this is too much work, it could at least offer an api to be notified by the external builder which artifacts have changed. 
Pros: Platform independent.
Cons: Requires dev-time, both on cdt and client side.

- The cdt could parse a return value of the build script to see if the project is up to date or if things changed.
Pros: Easy to implement, huge improvement in a common use case (starting a debug session w/o changing the code after the last build).
Cons: No improvement after real builds.

- The cdt could assume that builds are deterministic: If none of the sources changes, it need not build.
Pros: Huge improvement in a common use case (starting a debug session w/o changing the code after the last build).
Cons: No clue if this is a cdt responsibility or an eclipse one.

No, because this blindly breaks the originally intended behaviour of wanting to automatically refresh the resources.  If this is going to change, it will have to be a user-configurable option.

Possible, but won't work for cases where your build script's output is not recognized.  Refreshing the workspace works regardless of builder, so that feature can't go away.

We have an option for this now that will be available in CDT 6.0.  Try out a nightly build if you are eager.

Could you give me a pointer where "Updating Project" actually occurred? I tried the brute force patch by Paul Ventadoux, but Eclipse is still "Updating Project", even though it seemed to be faster. In any case, is there a wiki/faq or the like that describes how to develop/debug cdt within eclipse?

&gt; implemented by the Eclipse platform, so it would fall to them to implement
&gt; something like that.

The platform provides an extension point to contribute custom refresh providers for the 'automatically refresh' case. By default, the platform comes only with an optimized provider for win32 platforms, for all others it falls back to regular file system polling which does not scale well. Unfortunately the win32 provider does not scale well, either, because it monitors changes only on the project level. I.e. every change in the project tree leads to a complete project refresh.

Initially there was also a native refresh provider solution for Linux using FAM (File Alteration Monitor), but because of problems it has been dropped (see bug 52859).
BTW, there is also an optimized auto-refresh provider for the ClearCase MVFS file system.

The auto-refresh feature could be a way to avoid the explicit refresh after a build, provided it works reliably and scales to large projects.
So, creating auto-refresh providers optimized for the different platforms would be a nice contribution.

More information: http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/auto_refresh.html
Any news on this? Is it possible to just add some kind of checkbox (with warning that avoid refreshing is too bad thing)
Also project settings contains "Output Location" list. As a workaround Eclipse may assume that all modified (generated) during build files will be in one of "Output Location" directories. This should improve performance.
I think I may look at this for 7.0

There have been conflicting opinions on the scope of the refresh.  I think that's a separate issue that deserves its own bug.  I'll clone this to track that.
Hi, I work with a large group at Xerox that is trying to switch over to eclipse as our preferred C++ IDE but this bug is preventing our larger projects from making the switch. I have tried the work-around referenced in the above mentioned newsgroup but I noticed no change in behavior when building... the build completes quickly but then eclipse stalls at "Updating project" for a considerable amount of time.

Our build system does not add files that need to be indexed so if that is what "updating project" is doing, turning it off would be a viable solution for us. Anything would be better than sitting at a stalled eclipse window for upwards of 2 minutes.

I really need a workaround for this... can anybody help me and/or tell me if there is a nightly build out there that has a fix?

I really appreciate any help I can get.

Disables project refresh when auto refresh is on.

This patch disables all the nasty refreshes when you switch on workspace auto refresh in Eclipse's global preferences. For me, this is what makes the difference between usable and not :)

It has also become a problem for us and we are trying to figure out how to work around it.

This makes working with CMake CDT generator in a project with any reasonable size next to impossible.

Well it's obviously too late for 7.0, but I'd like to look at this as part of the scalability work I intend to do for 8.0.

An additional thought is that we could possibly have more settings than just a toggle.

E.g. "Only refresh folders X, Y, and Z after a build"

Add option for refresh after build

This patch adds an option in the Behavior tab.
I had a hard time figuring out from the two seconds I looked at the patch (sorry), but what is the default behavior? refresh or not?

To restart Chris's point, have we considered, or do we not already, only refresh the output folders. Wouldn't this make more sense than just turning it off?

I agree that it's more likely that user will want to restrict the scope of the refresh rather than avoid it altogether.

In the scenario where the output folder is the root of the project, recursively refreshing the output folder is probably not desirable.  Depending on how granular we wanted to get with the configurable scope of the refrsh, that scenario could be handled by just refreshing the final output file, or a list of binary files selected by the user.

Really I think the only benefit to have a setting to not refresh at all is that it's easier/faster to implement.  Not refreshing at all can be expressed as a special case of specifying a refresh scope, where the scope is empty.  The default behaviour would be to refresh the project root.  So upon further thought, personally I think that ought to be where we head.

I'm hoping to throw some non-functional mockups together for the Summit that we can discuss.

Output folders sounds good. There is Output Locations tab in project properties where one could add more folders or remove. Perhaps it can serve as the configurable scope and perhaps could allow add binary files as well. What purpose does Output Location serve now?

Now, it restricts the scope of the binary parser. So this would be a natural extension to that since it's purpose is to reflect where to find the build results.

The one problem I think we have is that the output location is per project, not per configuration. Ideally each config could have a different output folder to further restrict the refresh to the current config.

Refresh output folders

This patch refreshes only output folders and was inspired by the code in BinaryRunner. By default, the project folder is set in the output folders. It is still per project instead of per configuration.

I think they just stack at the project level. For example, if you add foo in Debug and bar in Release, and you do cproject.getOutputEntries, it will return both foo and bar. But they are separated in each config in the UI, I'm not sure how.
Is there something in IConfiguration or somewhere to get the output folder? You would be able to use that since the common builder knows what configuration is building.

That one displays only if "Generate Makefiles automatically" on "C/C++ Build" is unchecked. You are not entitled to see that when build system manages that for you.

I think it's only available for makefile projects (i.e. C/C++ Build &gt; Generate Makefiles automatically is disabled). For managed build the output directories are set automagically.

I'll add the following requirements as well:

- There needs to be a way to express that you wish a folder to be refreshed recursively, or not.  Right now it is just a list of folders, with exclusion patterns.  It's possible to express not wanting to refresh recursively by making an exlusion pattern that is equivalent to ./*/, but that's cumbersome.

- There should be an easy way to include/exclude known source extensions (taken from content types) by just clicking a checkbox rather than having to type your own exclusion pattern.  Some people generate code as part of their build process so they need the flexibility of refreshing source artifacts.  Others output binaries to the same location of their source and don't generate code, so they must be able to exclude sources easily.

Come to think of it, really we should let them easily add/remove any content type as an exclusion.  This stuff will get reused for UPC and Fortran, and who knows what other tools.  So, a simple checkbox on its own is not going to cut it.

Those are fair requirements. I hope you (or we?) have the time to accomplish this for 8.0. Looking at the history of the bug, I can't help but be a little concerned that it might slip yet again. I look forward to hearing from the CDT summit about this important issue.
(In reply to comment #43)
&gt; Configurable? Do you mean not only have it for External builder? Or something
&gt; similar to what Chris suggested?

Well my main concern is that you're only refreshing the output directory(ies) at DEPTH_ONE.  If you do this then you're forcing the user to add every single directory in the build tree to the output dir list? This would break our makefile projects, for example, which have a build tree of hundreds of directories mirroring the source tree with build artifacts scattered about the tree. This is why I think this should be configurable.

&gt; Looking at the history of the bug, I can't help but be a little
&gt; concerned that it might slip yet again...

I understand the feeling. We've had more pressing issues with making Managedbuild be correct and consistent which have kept us busy for a bit...

I think that, for performance on slow filesystems, we shouldn't do _any_ resource refresh inline with the build. This only delays the next build, keeps the resource tree locked, etc.  Instead it would be better to add a small bit of API to core.resources to allow requesting aysnchronous Refresh resources: bug 313673.

I agree.  The problem however is that we can't possibly enumerate ahead of time all the filesystems that are slow.

Even within a single filesystem, it may be the case that some stores are slow to refresh while others aren't.  Take the RSE EFS provider for example.  It can target both local and remote files... the local refreshes would be "fast" compared to the remote ones.  Although personally, I would make the choice there to just treat RSE as a whole as "slow" to refresh.

Putting my IBM hat on, for our product needs, it's sufficient for us to be able to programmatically set the refresh policy on a project while we are creating it from our IBM wizard.  Putting on my RDT hat, we can do the same thing there.

Putting my Eclipse hat back on, it might make sense to have an extension point that maps policies to EFS providers.  That would take care of the case where people are using a slow EFS provider but not using any specialized tooling over and above vanilla CDT.  That can still be tricky though, as we may have users downstream that don't like the choices we make if we provide some extensions to that extension point ourselves.  So I think maybe if we create said extension point, we ought not extend it ourselves in CDT.

You are right... asynchronous refreshes would make this a lot simpler.
That's a great point Chris. I'd be happy if we declare that out of the box, CDT assumes fast file systems. If you are working with a slow one, you need to install a plugin that tells the CDT that that file system is slow and under what conditions.

We rely too often on users setting preferences making it their problem instead of finding automated ways of helping them when we need help. And when they don't need help, we need to keep out of the way.

Refresh output folders

(In reply to comment #44)
&gt; (In reply to comment #43)
&gt; &gt; Configurable? Do you mean not only have it for External builder? Or something
&gt; &gt; similar to what Chris suggested?
&gt; 
&gt; Well my main concern is that you're only refreshing the output directory(ies)
&gt; at DEPTH_ONE.  If you do this then you're forcing the user to add every single
&gt; directory in the build tree to the output dir list? This would break our
&gt; makefile projects, for example, which have a build tree of hundreds of
&gt; directories mirroring the source tree with build artifacts scattered about the
&gt; tree. This is why I think this should be configurable.

No, the visitor goes through all sub directories, DEPTH_ONE is used to prevent multiple refreshes on the same sub directories. I just noticed a problem with the last patch, the visitor didn't leave the directory when the exclusion pattern was matched, this is fixed in the new patch.
*** Bug 326064 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Hi Chris. How are things progressing? Was this topic discussed at the summit?
Sorry if I lost track - would we have an option to disable auto-refresh altogether? For make projects it is not really needed...

design document (work in progress)

Attaching my design document for review.  It is still a work in progress and many sections are not filled in yet.  However I wanted to get feedback on the basic idea before I proceed much further.

Without going through the entire rationale (the rationale is lengthy, so read it in the design document), the basic idea of the design is to provide a new UI and underlying model to handle the post-build refresh, as the existing Output Locations system does not really work for what we want to do.  The new system will provide for the inclusion/exclusion of particular resources according to various nested rules, e.g. "refresh the entire tree under project root, EXCEPT C/C++ source files and header files, EXCEPT do a refresh on /myproject/somefolder/generated_file.cpp"

James, I would particularly like your feedback on the proposed platform change I have in mind before I file a RFE against Platform Resources.
Hi Chris, thanks for working on this. I read most of the document. We have multiple generated source files in different folders which always have the same name, say "generated.cpp". It would be great to be able to include all of those without having to specify them individually. Would this be covered in phase 2? I see Resource exceptions but I'm not sure if "generated.cpp" would work as "*/generated.cpp"?

Interesting that you mention that.  Originally I had come up with a "Resource Name Pattern" exclusion that would allow for just the scenario you mention, but then I thought maybe I was overdoing it and that no one would use it because 99% of the time all they cared about was specifying the file extension.  I guess you've proved me wrong :-)  I can re-add the requirement.  File extension exclusions would then just be a special case of resource name exclusion.
Interesting proposal Chris.

With resource filters there's already some precedent for filtering resources - see how children are filtered during UnifiedTree#getLocalList(...). One could imagine hooking a filter to refresh local to prevent stat'ing some files which don't match a certain spec.

Taking a small step back, it looks like this proposal only addresses post-build refresh, invoked at end of CDT build.  Is RefreshScopeManager in CDT on top of core.resoruces? If so, there will still be issues with Project-level refresh, and/or auto-refresh unless the refresh behaviour is specified in core.resources, right?  

It's worth bearing in mind a few platform bugs on the same issue:
   Bug 281387 Exclude directories from refresh
   Bug 244979 / Bug 91432 Lazy Refresh
   Bug 313673 API to perform async refresh 

A few other comments:
  3.5.4 It must be easy to exclude files based on Eclipse content types. 
This is going to be hard, right?  To know the content type (without using the extension) the first few bytes of the file are read which will be more expensive than a simple stat...?

  3.6.1 A post-build refresh on a typical 5,000 – 10,000 file remote project should take no more than one minute.
One minute is a _very_ long time. I get fed up with waiting 20s for a post-build refresh. 
I think any solution should require user isn't blocked from continuing work. i.e. workspace should not remain locked for more than 1-2s at any one time.  If we don't do this users will stick to emacs...

The semantics of out-of-sync files aren't clear to me.  They'll be visible when iterating of the resource hierarchy, but if opened editors will report out-of-sync (though we could fix this).  By not keeping them eagerly in-sync team providers, resource change listeners, etc. won't be able to update their models.  This may be fine, but does bear thinking about.

Perhaps we should discuss this and potential solutions on the core.resources call and bugzillas?
I looked over the proposal and it looks good for me.

Just a couple of thoughts which I am not sure how to fit in the picture:
- There is bug 305474 asking for refresh *before* the build, and another bug somewhere in CDT about refreshing after pre-build step which could possibly generate source files for internal builder. Maybe a checkbox could be added?
- There is "Refresh automatically" preference in General-&gt;Workspace. Some might argue that this flag should be used, i.e. if it is enabled then refresh should be kicked off in background. If disabled then the user indicated the desire to do any refresh manually. Similarly to the argument utilized in bug 14867.

&gt; Interesting proposal Chris.
&gt; With resource filters there's already some precedent for filtering resources -
&gt; see how children are filtered during UnifiedTree#getLocalList(...). One could
&gt; imagine hooking a filter to refresh local to prevent stat'ing some files which
&gt; don't match a certain spec.

I will take a look at that.

&gt; Taking a small step back, it looks like this proposal only addresses post-build
&gt; refresh, invoked at end of CDT build.  Is RefreshScopeManager in CDT on top of
&gt; core.resoruces? If so, there will still be issues with Project-level refresh,
&gt; and/or auto-refresh unless the refresh behaviour is specified in
&gt; core.resources, right?  

Yes, this is on top of core.resources, so it would not affect anything to do with auto-refreh.  As far as project-level refresh (I assume you mean the one after the build, not a manual one?), the idea is that the platform gives us a way to discover new children without stat'ing everything, then if there are exclusions present in the model, we actually break up the project level refresh and invoke our own refreshes that only stat the resources we want.

One problem I am worried about though is making sure the stat'ing is done efficiently.  The straightforward approach is to visit the resources, apply our exclusion criteria, and then individually refresh each remaining resource.  That might be inefficient compared to doing one big request or a series of batched requests where you get many of the stats in one transaction.  EFS has a way of doing batch refreshes... IFileSystem.fetchFileTree(IFileStore, IProgressMonitor).  When you call that you get a whole chunk of the tree in one go.  This would circumvent that, although I'm not entirely sure it's being used much by EFS providers anyway.

&gt; It's worth bearing in mind a few platform bugs on the same issue:
&gt;    Bug 281387 Exclude directories from refresh
&gt;    Bug 244979 / Bug 91432 Lazy Refresh
&gt;    Bug 313673 API to perform async refresh

Yeah I think those will help some, but we'll still need this for a few reasons:

- Refreshing more than you need to still consumes bandwidth/CPU resources that might either be shared with other users or other operations that you yourself are trying to accomplish.

- You might literally be paying for said resources, so doing more than you need to costs money.

- Refreshing more than you need to, even asynchronously, might still make the user wait to do something longer than they need to.  E.g. they've built their project and wish to debug the resulting binary, but have to wait for the binary to show up in the tree before they can debug it.

So, I see this all these improvements as complementary.

&gt; A few other comments:
&gt;   3.5.4 It must be easy to exclude files based on Eclipse content types. 
&gt; This is going to be hard, right?  To know the content type (without using the
&gt; extension) the first few bytes of the file are read which will be more
&gt; expensive than a simple stat...?

Yes, if your content type is based on the file contents then this is going to get expensive.  If the check can be done based on extension alone then it never reads the file contents to determine the content type.  I don't foresee that as coming up often enough.  If it's problematic enough a user could use a resource name pattern exclusion instead.  E.g. if you have some content type that is a type of .xml file and the only way to know the true content type is to read the contents of the file, then maybe you might just tell the system to refresh all *.xml files rather than telling it to refresh only that specific content type, as I would imagine doing the stat for the refresh is cheaper than doing the open and then reading a few bytes.

&gt;   3.6.1 A post-build refresh on a typical 5,000 – 10,000 file remote project
&gt; should take no more than one minute.
&gt; One minute is a _very_ long time. I get fed up with waiting 20s for a
&gt; post-build refresh. 
&gt; I think any solution should require user isn't blocked from continuing work.
&gt; i.e. workspace should not remain locked for more than 1-2s at any one time.  If
&gt; we don't do this users will stick to emacs...

Good point.  I probably should have been clearer.  The requirement wasn't intended to be a metric of how long any given resource is locked or how the refreshes are broken up, or whether the user can do anything while the refresh is happening.  It was meant as a goal to measure how much time is spent refreshing in total.

&gt; The semantics of out-of-sync files aren't clear to me.  They'll be visible when
&gt; iterating of the resource hierarchy, but if opened editors will report
&gt; out-of-sync (though we could fix this).  By not keeping them eagerly in-sync
&gt; team providers, resource change listeners, etc. won't be able to update their
&gt; models.  This may be fine, but does bear thinking about.
&gt; Perhaps we should discuss this and potential solutions on the core.resources
&gt; call and bugzillas?

Yep, I'm happy to discuss all of this.  When is the next core.resources call?
(In reply to comment #56)
&gt; I looked over the proposal and it looks good for me.
&gt; Just a couple of thoughts which I am not sure how to fit in the picture:
&gt; - There is bug 305474 asking for refresh *before* the build, and another bug
&gt; somewhere in CDT about refreshing after pre-build step which could possibly
&gt; generate source files for internal builder. Maybe a checkbox could be added?

The refresh before the build scares me a bit if the platform is going to handle it (Bug 305474 is filed against platform resources).  I think each builder ought to be in charge of its own refreshing.

Refreshing after the pre-build step is something I hadn't thought of but I'm not against it so long as it's configurable (most projects don't need to refresh at that point).  We could just add an option to refresh or not at this phase, and have it obey the same refresh policy we use for the post-build refresh.  Do you think that would be sufficient?  Having multiple totally different refresh policies is something I'd like to avoid if at all possible, but if it is truly required then I'll go there.

&gt; - There is "Refresh automatically" preference in General-&gt;Workspace. Some might
&gt; argue that this flag should be used, i.e. if it is enabled then refresh should
&gt; be kicked off in background. If disabled then the user indicated the desire to
&gt; do any refresh manually. Similarly to the argument utilized in bug 14867.

Others will argue though that they don't want to wait for an automatic refresh to kick off "when it feels like it."
Bug 334930 filed against platform resources to track platform changes in support of refreshing new children without doing attribute checks on all children.

We've got a working implementation of Phase One coming in M7 (currently in HEAD).  Try it out.  You can specify a list of resources to refresh, and you can specify Resource Exclusions.  Note that the refresh policy is not used by the internal builder by design, as it refreshes resources as it executes individual build steps.

One thing I intend to change is the way the data is stored.  Right now it's stored in a persistent resource property, but I didn't realize that those are stored in the workspace, not in the project.  I want the refresh data to be  part of the project itself, and team shared.

There is still a bunch of code cleanup as well to be done.  Missing javadoc, etc.

Created attachment 194418
RefreshScopeManager exceptions patch

I just updated my CDT install to 8.0.0.201104291533 (Build #676)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create two CDT projects. (Do not open the first project properties in between). Or open an existing workspace with more than one CDT project.
2. Open one of the project properties.
3. Click OK


Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a project
2. Open the project properties.
3. Click OK
4. Delete the project
5. Create another project
6. Open one the project properties.
7. Click OK


The first one is very serious since it prevents saving project properties. I'm going to commit simple workarounds for now so that M7 is usable.

Sorry, I'm a bonehead.  It had nothing to do with threadsafeness.  You can't modify the contents of a map while you iterate over its keyset.  Duh.

Should hopefully be fixed now for real.  I was able to reproduce your problem after trying enough times, now I can't after the changes.

Still TODO:

- Redo where the settings are stored, so they are team shared.
- Fix the scheduling rule for the refresh.  Right now it locks the workspace.  Won't be hard to fix, I just need to set the right scheduling rule.
- Code cleanup
The refresh scope data is now serialized/deserialized to/from the C project description.

Also fixed a stack overflow issue with loading.

Also moved ResourceExclusion and friends to internal packages.

Still TODO:  alter scheduling rules for the refresh operation, more code cleanup.

&gt; The refresh is now scheduled on the resources to be refreshed.

The rule used for the scheduling isn't right.

You need to get the refresh rule from the resource rule factory (but this would be overkill...). Easiest fix is just to run this with a 'null' scheduling rule as you had before.  The workspace will already acquire the scheduling rules needed for running the refresh. This will be done at the individual resource layer so will allow concurrent modification in the tree and minmize the scope of the locking while the refresh is in progress.

Not quite true... I was using this:

org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspace.run(IWorkspaceRunnable, IProgressMonitor)

"This is a convenience method, fully equivalent to: workspace.run(action, workspace.getRoot(), IWorkspace.AVOID_UPDATE, monitor);"

I'll try a null rule though...
(In reply to comment #104)
Ah woops.  Out of interest I wonder why you're doing the refresh in an IWorkspaceRunnable rather than just having a method:
  RefreshScopeManager.getDefault().refresh(IProject) 
The build is already run in a workspace operation, so there's no additional advantage to nesting another one within it.
A few other comments on RefreshScopeManager:
 1) Delta: Change the settings, close the project &amp; re-open the project, the Refresh Policy tab is empty (maybe this is 3?).
 2) loadSettings(...): 
   IResource resource = workspaceRoot.findMember(resourcePath);
   if (resource == null) {
        // error
   }
   This looks wrong: after a clean, or for a freshly imported project, the build directory may not exist so this very like will be null, right, so the RSM will miss that resource forever more?
 3) #persistSettings looks wrong. It looks like its persisting *all* the refresh settings into the passed in ICProjectDescription.  Presumably it only wants to set them for the project = projectDescription.getProject();
 4) When processing the resource delta, it returns true for all ! instanceof Project which will cause the visitor to run over the full delta, which is inefficient
 5) Using #getProjectToResourcesMap() to initialize the 3 maps: RSM is singleton, so perhaps just create them at construction.
 6) Locking: imo it would be better to use thread-safe data structures (Collections.synchronize... or Concurrent....()), rather than making each method synchronized. Coarse locking makes it difficult to reason about potential deadlocks (and in this case doesn't seem to be needed).
 7) API Visibility: All this stuff is publicly visible. Can it live in an internal package so we can minimize breakage in the future e.g. org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.resources?  MBS can be friends of cdt.core so should be able to see all the *.internal.* stuff without issue or warning.
 8) Tidy: As the classes are new can you sort methods &amp; format code to standard

&gt;   RefreshScopeManager.getDefault().refresh(IProject) 
&gt; The build is already run in a workspace operation, so there's no additional

This was to allow for moving the refresh to a Job in some cases, for bug 330360

&gt; A few other comments on RefreshScopeManager:
&gt;  1) Delta: Change the settings, close the project &amp; re-open the project, the
&gt; Refresh Policy tab is empty (maybe this is 3?).

Crap, it was working before... Yeah I think the move to the project description broke this.

&gt;  2) loadSettings(...): 
&gt;    IResource resource = workspaceRoot.findMember(resourcePath);
&gt;    if (resource == null) {
&gt;         // error
&gt;    }
&gt;    This looks wrong: after a clean, or for a freshly imported project, the
&gt; build directory may not exist so this very like will be null, right, so the RSM
&gt; will miss that resource forever more?

Good point... I forgot that findMember() won't return a handle if the resource doesn't exist.  Arg.  I can't seem to find a convenient API for this either.  All the handle based APIs require you know up front if you want an IFolder or an IFile.  I guess I'll have to store the resource type when serializing...

&gt;  3) #persistSettings looks wrong. It looks like its persisting *all* the
&gt; refresh settings into the passed in ICProjectDescription.  Presumably it only
&gt; wants to set them for the project = projectDescription.getProject();

Yeah... an artifact of moving to the project description stuff.  Will fix... this will cause problems if each project has differet settings.

&gt;  4) When processing the resource delta, it returns true for all ! instanceof
&gt; Project which will cause the visitor to run over the full delta, which is
&gt; inefficient

Will fix...

&gt;  5) Using #getProjectToResourcesMap() to initialize the 3 maps: RSM is
&gt; singleton, so perhaps just create them at construction.

Yeah I intended to fix that as a part of the cleanup.

&gt;  6) Locking: imo it would be better to use thread-safe data structures
&gt; (Collections.synchronize... or Concurrent....()), rather than making each
&gt; method synchronized. Coarse locking makes it difficult to reason about
&gt; potential deadlocks (and in this case doesn't seem to be needed).

I'll look into it..

&gt;  7) API Visibility: All this stuff is publicly visible. Can it live in an
&gt; internal package so we can minimize breakage in the future e.g.
&gt; org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.resources?  MBS can be friends of cdt.core so
&gt; should be able to see all the *.internal.* stuff without issue or warning.

No, because RDT needs to use this stuff too, so that the RemoteMakeBuilder can use it.

Everything is marked (or should be marked...) provisional.

&gt;  8) Tidy: As the classes are new can you sort methods &amp; format code to standard

I can do a sort... I format to 120 characters already typically but I'll do a mass format during the cleanup to be sure I didn't miss anything.  Formatting to 80 characters results in a mess so I prefer to stick to 120.

&gt; No, because RDT needs to use this stuff too, so that the RemoteMakeBuilder can
&gt; use it.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything is marked (or should be marked...) provisional.

Ah, Ok.  Presumably the RemoteMakeBuilder is just calling one API method: #getRefreshRunnable() or is it using other API? 

Even if this is provisional, having all the implementation exposed may lead API users to make incorrect assumptions by reading the implementation.

The ideal would be do have an Interface which exposes the API contract. 

Alternatively, you can copy RSM to InternalRSM under *.internal.*, have the visible RSM extend InternalRSM and just replace the methods that you want to be visible.  It's then very clear to consumers what API is what the contract is, maybe something like:
 
public class RefreshScopeManager extend InternalRefreshScopeManager {
 /**
  * Document me
  */
 @Override
 public static RefreshScopeManager getInstance() {
   return super.getInstance();
 } 

 /**
  * Document me
  */
 @Override
 public IWorkspaceRunnable getRefreshRunnable(final IProject project) {
    return super.getRefreshRunnable(project);
 }
}

That way you minimize how much documentation you need to write, and makes it very clear what people can rely on.  Clearly it doesn't stop them using the internal public methods, but it does hide the complexity of the implementation: synchronization - persistence - data structures, etc. ;)

&gt; I can do a sort... I format to 120 characters already typically but I'll do a
&gt; mass format during the cleanup to be sure I didn't miss anything.  Formatting
&gt; to 80 characters results in a mess so I prefer to stick to 120.

Personally I'm happy about long lines, there are just some whitespace oddities...
Scheduling rule is fixed.

Fixed, at least for Project, File, and Folder resources.  For other resources, I don't know of a way to create the right type of object, so I just use findMember() as a fallback.  Note that Groups will work properly because they are virtual, so if they don't exist, refreshing won't recreate them.

*** cdt cvs genie on behalf of crecoskie ***
Bug 133881 - Make refreshing after building optional
- changed scheduling rule to be null so that the platform handles the locking on individual resources
- fixed it so only the given project's settings are serialized in its project description
- fixed it so projects/folders/files can be refreshed even if they were removed from the resource tree but not the filesystem
- optimized resource delta processing

There are still various cleanup tasks to complete, but these will have to wait for post-Indigo, as I don't want to destabilize anything.

Since the main request (making refreshes optional) is complete, I will resolve this as FIXED and we'll deal with any new bugs/changes separately.
Two questions:

1) Is this feature available in the nightly build of CDT. Ie. http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/builds/8.0.0/I.I201106081058/index.html

2) Is there any user documentation available on this feature?

Yes it's available in Indigo (CDT 8).  That build should have it.

However, for comments we're switching back to StyledText due to the scrolling and other annoying issues with long form text, and so Rob ended up having to do the links manually.

I'm not sure if this has any adverse effects yet but it certainly looks like it might. I'm using the WTP 1.0.2 200603160607 build.
That is triggered when a src path is added for the project root; the call to createLink() is being made with a zero-segment Path, however, the Path does not have a leading separator (J2EEElementChangeListener is removing the first segment from a relative path to create an empty path) so the test for isRoot() fails in VirtualComponent (I don't think it should be making this check since the method asks for a project relative path) and instead an attempt is made to call "resource = getProject().getFolder(aProjectRelativeLocation);" which obviously fails - other than generating an error message and failing to automatically add a mapping to the .component file, this should not have other negative consequences.

Although this could be fixed in J2EEElementChangeListener, I think the correct fix is in VirtualComponent (include a check for isEmpty()); I've verified this and will attach a patch.

    <WithStack>When browsing trough tasks it is easy to flush out other opened editors. So, in most of the cases it would make sense to reuse single task editor or close previous one (unless it is pinned) when opening new task editor. It should work the same for local, bugzilla and jira task viewers/editors. 

This is somehow similar to Synchronize view which is using single comparison editor, but perhaps configuration preference to enable such behaviour wuld make sense...
Interesting, I never noticed that the Synchronize view had started doing that.

I often rely on having mutlipe bug editors visible, same with local editors.  But I know what you mean--I just end up with too many of them sometimes.  One interesting thing is that once interest is modeled for tasks correctly they can close automatically when they become uninteresting.  But this prefernece might still be a good idea.
This breaks our use of the editor model (e.g. dealing with unsaved changes) and as such we need to defer considering this functionality.

Rob: I've been getting these occasionally on submitting a new report as well.  The work-around is simply to close and open thre report gain.
This time I saw a slightly different exception.  It seems that when downloading a new report we might time out?

This seems to come from the server connection being reset, not sure so we'll have to isolate, and we'll need a test case that creates a new report.  

Work-around is to double-click the report.
It looks like this may be resolved already, but leaving open so that we keep an eye on it.
We still get timeouts from the server sometimes and will need to continue streamlining that, but these IOExceptions are now gone.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I just created new Bugzlla task using Mylar (latest dev build) and g the following exception after submitting it. I suppose this is when Mylar is opening editor for newly created task.

Rob: I've been getting these occasionally on submitting a new report as well.  The work-around is simply to close and open thre report gain.
This time I saw a slightly different exception.  It seems that when downloading a new report we might time out?

    <WithStack>I installed Eclipse + WTP 1.0.1. I have been using WTP 0.7.1 in the past. 

When I imported my WebContent folder from CVS, I noticed that the Web App Libraries folder stayed empty. I went to "J2EE module dependancies", and I added manually the JAR files. Two of them (activation.jar and antlj.jar) triggered a dialog box error. The import of the source went well and the application worked OK with Tomcat 5.5.

I created another project, and this time it got worse. Every JAR file triggered a dialog box. I have about 50 JAR files. 

As a result, I went back to 0.7.1. I think that JAR files in the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib should be automatically recognized. I shouldn't have to go to "J2EE module dependancies" in the first place.
I think we need more information here.  What exactly is this issue?  What are the dialogs?  You should not need to add a j2ee module dependency for any JAR which is already in the web-inf/lib folder.  Perhaps the properties page should not even allow it.  Is the issue the web app container is not dynamically updated to show the libraries in web-inf/lib?  Where are they not showing up?

I do see thee working in WTP 1.0.2.  Have your tried 1.0.2?
Created attachment 37260
missing web app libraries and error message

I haven't tested it with 1.0.2, this is what I get with 1.0.1.

image 1. the initial empty project (I used the legacy JavaSource name for the src folder, I do use 1.0.1)
image 2. the same project, after the "WebContent" folder has been populated/overriden by CVS
image 3: the JAR selection screen
image 4: the error message when I add libraries "manually". Note that the web app libraries directory is suddenly populated when that message pops up
Looks like a refresh issue with the web app container.  

Kosta, can you take a look?
I need more information regarding what exactly you did to "import my WebContent folder from CVS". I am unable to reproduce the problem that you are describing. I tried dragging jars into WEB-INF/lib as well as copying jars on file system and then refreshing in eclipse. In both cases the Web App Libraries container picked up on changes. 

Note that it's invalid to try to add WEB-INF/lib jars via the J2EE module dependencies UI. The UI should probably check for that case.
I think you'd need to use CVS to reproduce this bug.

My module structure in CVS is:
  - framework
      - JavaSource
      - WebContent

I click the empty project "framework"  in Eclipse. I select File &gt; Import &gt; Checkout projects from CVS. "Use existing repository location" &gt; "Use an existing module". I open the CVS module "framework" and I select in that module the sub-module "WebContent". After that, I do "Check-out into existing project". Then I select the project "framework" as parent of target folder. I pick the "HEAD" tag and press FINISH.
I suspect that this and 136897 are dupes...

    <WithStack>I can create a SELECT statement object because the SELECT class is not in an internal package.  However, if I attempt to execute it, I get a warning from the JDT compiler telling me that access to the QueryStatement.execute() method is discouraged, because QueryStatement is in an internal package.

Either QueryStatement must not be internal, or SELECT must redefine all of the public methods of the QueryStatement class to just call super().

I am indicating a major severity because it is not possible to use this API in an environment that enforces internal access violations.
Redefines the three public methods in SELECT class (execute, getEObjects and resume) and made them final. These methods delegate to the super.
Move to verified as per bug 206558.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In WTP 1.0.1, you renamed the JavaSource folder to src. I agree that "src" is more of a standard than "JavaSource", so it seemed like a good idea at first

Well, it is not such a good idea. Eclipse beling linked to CVS, it is used to manage other "src" files than Java source files. For example, I use to store my Photoshop (psp) source files inside my projects. Until now, I had a folder called "NonJavaSource", with a "psp" sub-folder. If you do want to have a "src" folder, it would make more sense to have a "src" folder and have a "java" folder under it.

The same thing goes for your ".deployable" folder. It was a good idea to change the name, because Windows doesn't like folder names starting with a dot. However, the "build" folder is commonly used to store the ant script, or any script to build the program. I would suggest a better name such as "stage" or "staging".
Moving to jst.j2ee
Hi - 

The Java source folder is configurable on the third page of the Web Project wizard, and can be changed after creation as well.  This is just a default, and we understand other structures may be better suited for different environments.
We are working on making most of these settings "sticky", and remembering per workspace the last default used.

The concept of the ".deployables" beng used as a staging areas for the assembled war/j2ee artifacts has been removed since 0.7  (The assembly is now in the server metadata area outside the workspace if needed).  We now simply have a default java output location, and we chose "build/classes" 


I do see the advantage of always using the default settings in the Java preference page.
Java - BuildPath - source file name and output file name.

Kosta - adding you to the cc list, do you agree should start using this existing
preference?
I would really like if the workspace could remember my "JavaSource" naming preference.

Just a note, not sure whether it belongs here, but I preferred the concept of "deployable" folder. 

In the past, I could just take the deployables folder, copy it in another directory, modify 2 or 3 files if needed for deployment, zip it as a war file, and release it. No need to have fancy "ant" configurations, or merge manually several directories.

I am sure geting rid of the deployables folder has other benefits but since the build directory contains only classes, I have to manually copy those classes into the WebContent/classes directory when I prepare a war archive. That's one more step.



I think it makes sense to respect the default values specified in Java -&gt; Build Path preference page with one exception. In a new workspace, the default value is to use project root as src dir and classes dir. That initial setting makes not sense for us. I don't even know if that would work because WebContent would be nested beneath java source dir. To workaround this, we could use "src" if project root is specified. We should also check for src / webcontent overalap.

Ultimately, we should add ability to configure the classes output directory on project creation like we do for source directory.</WithStack>

Do you by any chance have a directory on the aspectpath for that project which contains aspects built by a different version of AspectJ?

&gt; Do you by any chance have a directory on the aspectpath for that project which

&gt; 
No, no other versions of AspectJ anywhere.

do you have anything at all on either the inpath or aspectpath?

I do.  Let me explain my project structure.  It's a pretty standard MyEclipse J2EE structure, with EAR, EJB and Web projects, where Web depends on EJB and EAR, and EJB depends on EAR.  The aspect resides in the EJB project, which is AJ enabled.  I have the classes folder of the Web project in the aspectpath of the EJB project.  I have a whole separate problem with that particular scenario, but that has nothing to do with this bug (I don't think.)
Re-categorizing as "compiler" rather than "LTWeaving". We should go back to the raiser to see if this still occurs. If so we can try the the new tracing infrastructure.
I'm guessing you are no longer seeing this problem, having either got past it or not using AJ now?  If you are please respond and I'll mark this appropriately (now we actually have some real resource working on AspectJ!) - otherwise I'll close in a few days.
no response - please reopen if still an issue</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Build Date: 22/03/06
OS: RHEL 4 with Arabic-Egypt locale set as default.

Steps to recreate the problem:

1.Switch to the Java perspective and import the attached "schoollibrary" project. 
2.Create a new EMF project based on the Rose model, use the attached "library.mdl" (in school library project) as Model URI.

3.Open the new .ecore file, in the Ecore editor, expand the tree to reveal the package and classes. Expand and select Writer. 


4. Use the following key sequence, to change the Value of the name attribute in the properties view, [set your keyboard layer to Arabic and type "hkds _"  then switch your keyboard layer back to English and type "Anis"]


Expected output:

The Writer name item should be displayed as " &lt;AR&gt;_Anis: Estring ", where &lt;AR&gt; is the Arabic word. See the attached fig1 for more illustrations


Actual output:

The Writer name is displayed as shown in fig2, which isn't the expected behavior.

Note: If the Writer name used above is invalid. A warning or an error message should be displayed to the user.

It looks like you went out of your way to cause a problem by introducing a space in the name, which isn't a valid character in the name.  So I'll return it as a duplicate of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=75933.

In general, I wonder why can't you just attach the .ecore file with the problematic characters rather than making me follow steps I can't perform on my local machine?

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 75933 ***
I guess the point is not a whitespace, but unexpected order of the output misleading the user.

The attribute name was entered as &lt;ARABIC&gt;_Anis
The expected display is &lt;CIBARA&gt;_Anis: Estring 
The actual display is Anis: Estring_&lt;CIBARA&gt;

This bug is rather similar to bug 131711.
Is the problem reproducible without the white space?

The space in the defect description was a typo. This problem occurs without the white spaces.
This looks to be just a variation on a general theme, none of which we'll have time to address in the current development cycle.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 131711 ***
Keeping as a seperate bug, bug 131711 is opened against Windows while this bug is opened against Linux.
When https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=135674 is addressed we'll look at these issues in generated editors.  At that point you will be able to verify the defect(s) on each platform and if they aren't all fixed by a single fix, then it makes sense to reopen.  Until then, you have the separate bugzilla number you want regardless of its duplicate state and it doesn't make sense to insist it's not a duplicate problem just because it was tested on a different platform.  

Are you saying this test passed on a Windows platform and only failed on Linux.
