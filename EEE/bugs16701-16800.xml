I don't suppose you can reproduce this on a VM that gives line numbers?
I've looked over the method and I can see one possibility.
Line 551 - compilationUnit= getCompilationUnit(frame);
getCompilationUnit(frame) says that it returns null for binary stack frames. 
If you did an HCR with a binary on the stack, you could get a null 
compilationUnit which we weren't handling.

Whether or not this is the source of Peter's NPE, we should fix this up by 
adding:
if (compilationUnit == null) {
  continue;
}
Sorry :(

Like I said, it only happened the once, and it didn't present any error in the 
UI, so I don't know exactly when it happened. I've logged a PR against J9 re: 
line numbers, though. Unfortunately J9 doesn't keep any debug info on the 
target, so it's difficult to show line numbers.


Fixed as explained above.
Please verify.

I have an older workspace (not too old - I just mean that it already existed).
I started it in 20020521, and got the "Please wait while completing install" 
splash screen. So far, so good.
Then I exited and restarted eclipse, and I did not get the "Please wait while 
completing install" splash screen. Still ok.
I worked in eclipse for several hours.
Then I decided to install the examples, so I exited eclipse, unzipped the 
examples zip into my eclipse directory, and restarted eclipse. (this is how I 
always used to install the examples zip).
This time, when starting eclipse, I got a "Changes Detected - update?" dialog, 
and I clicked Yes, and got the "Configuration Changes" dialog. OK, I guess this 
makes sense, because I have new example plugins.
But 2 of the 4 "Detected Changes" in the tree in this dialog have error icons. 
I clicked on the "Error Details.." button, but nothing happened.
There is nothing special in the .log.
I will attach my zipped up .config directory, and also a snap of the 
Configuration Changes dialog.
Created attachment 930
Snapshot of Configuration Changes dialog with error icons
Created attachment 931
Zip of .config directory
"Delete" button doesn't do anything either.
I also don't understand why there are 2 non-error changes detected.
I would have thought there would be only one - for the examples.
I will attach another snapshot showing that for some reason, the Configuration 
Changes dialog wants to (re?) install my eclipse SDK and eclipse JDT SDK.
This isn't right, because I already installed them the previous time that I 
started eclipse - right? I was running for several hours using eclipse and the 
JDT. I don't understand why it thinks these need to be reinstalled?
After doing step K6 of the update scenarios I have a similar situation.  This 
dialog shows one update item that contains no errors, yet the "Show errors..." 
button is always enabled.  Pressing this button doesn't seem to do anything.

Vlad, this bug has several issues, only one of them being related to duplicate 
bugs ('Delete' not working and 'Show details' being enabled). If you check the 
screenshot, there are several deltas, and the one that is expanded shows 
missing features (shows URL instead of the name and 0.0.0 for the version).

Christophe?
The URL and 0.0.0 is valid when the feature doesn't exist anymore.
This is the same when the featureReference still exists (in teh XML) but the 
real feature doesn't. This is why the feature is marked as broken and will not 
be configured
I know, but why did she have them in the first place?
b/c we had a bug were we didn't delete the XML when a delta occured.
then probably the directory where the features were is now deleted.
It will occur even in new code if customer never deletes/process the delta but 
deletes the file system.
Working as designed, user should be able to delete XML at that point
Delete and show status buttons fixed.</WithStack>

Why the information of the element to be run is part of configuration?  I am
questioning this because I have to launch different elements of the same
type (Java files, for examples) using the same "configuration" (in the Java
example, reusing the classpath, JRE and so).  For each run I execute now I
need to change the configuration what is quite annoying.

I was thinking on having something similar to select a configuration that I
want to apply to an element and run the pair ("element" + "configuration").

Is this reasonable?
Use the "duplicate" feature to copy a configuration. It is available from the 
pop-up menu in the launch configuration dialog. Then, all you need to change is 
the main type - i.e. the name of the class you are running.

The element to be run is a critical part of the configuration.</WithStack>

type (Java files, for examples) using the same "configuration" (in the Java
example, reusing the classpath, JRE and so).  For each run I execute now I
need to change the configuration what is quite annoying.

I was thinking on having something similar to select a configuration that I
want to apply to an element and run the pair ("element" + "configuration").

Is this reasonable?
Use the "duplicate" feature to copy a configuration. It is available from the 
pop-up menu in the launch configuration dialog. Then, all you need to change is 
the main type - i.e. the name of the class you are running.

The element to be run is a critical part of the configuration.</WithOutStack>

There are no errors but it doesn't load the changes. This only happens once you
opened two editors on the same file. It seems to have something to do with the 
DocumentProvider and working copy.

This is a blocker for us (the WSAD Java Visual Editor) because we have this 
situtuation by default and we can't get validateEdit kind of stuff working 
because of this.
Looking through the code, I'm guessing what is happening is that the 
AbstractTextEditor is doing a setInput with the FileInput. What happens under 
the covers is that the editor disconnects from the document and then reconnects 
back. I'm guessing that if there is no other editor open on the document, the 
disconnect frees the document and the connect gets a brand new one, which will 
get the current file contents. And if the document is shared, the disconnect 
simply decrements the inuse counter, and reconnect increments it again, but 
since the document didn't go away it uses the old contents.

Search is not modal because it was designed to run in the background and not 
block the UI. Searching for new upades may take a long time. The search itself 
is executing on a non-modal background thread and progress indicator is simply 
updated when there are news to report. Search can run with no UI whatsoever 
(for example, launched on startup in as a low priority background thread).</WithStack>

Observe: Feature "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0.200205211339"
is configured, and "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0" is disabled.

This makes me suspect the problem is with the about features dialog code,
rather than with the underlying configuration.


I have looked at this scenario and the problem would appear to be with the 
packaged feature on the update site. The plugin corresponding to the feature 
should have (by convention) the same version number as the feature. In this 
case the feature is org.eclipse.platform.win32_2.0.0.200205211339 and the 
corresponding plugins is org.eclipse.platform.win32_2.0.0.v20020521 (note the 
missing 1139 at the end). Should fix in the repackager (for feature plugins 
should be using the feature version rather than what is in the build-manifest).
The feature.xml explicitly gives the version id of its plug-ins. I don't think 
there should be any necessary correlation between the version id of the 
feature and the version id of the corresponding plug-in (if any). Why does the 
platform care?
Moving to update/core for resolution.
Have released changes to update and core.boot to keep track of both the feature 
version and the corresponding plugin version (if different) in the 
platform.cfg. The current API you are calling (IFeatureEntry.getFeatureVersion
()) will continue to return the feature version. There is a new API 
(IFeatureEntry.getFeaturePluginVersion()) that returns the version of the 
plugin. So you should be calling the new one for the About (because you are 
trying to get the attribution plugin).

Note: read the javadoc. I cannot guarantee that you will actually find the 
plugin in the registry. The user has many ways of injecting plugin versions 
into the install environment, and the runtime registry loading may load some 
other version of this plugin. So your code needs to handle the case where the 
registry has some other version of the plugin you are looking for, or has no 
version of the plugin. This should not happen in "normal" use, but can.

Code is in HEAD (core.boot, update.core). Should go into tomorrows build.
The code that displays the about box should be unconcerned by these 
complications. It should simply extract attribution info from the
plug-in in the plug-in registry with the same id as the feature.
If there is no plug-in with that id, the about box code should act
is if the feature requires no attribution.

Great .... sounds like I just spent time fixing something that did not need to 
be fixed (because it got moved to me to resolve). So, it seems like the About 
dialog can either

(1) always ignore any version information it gets from the configuration, and 
just lookup any old plugin matching the id

(2) use the plugin version information it gets from the configuration, and 
lookup the exact plugin.

In either case, if the plugin you are looking for is not in the registry (which 
could be the case in either scenario), then just ignore the feature on the 
About.
Have verified the support to get the correct plugin version is in 20020528. Over 
to the UI team to implement either (1) or (2) from prior post in the About 
dialog.
Changed logic to the following:
1. Given a feature id and version we try to find a plugin descriptor with a 
matching id and version. 
2. If none is found we try to find a plugin descriptor with a matching id
3. If none is found the feature does not appear in the about features dialog.</WithStack>

1. start eclipse
2. exit (want platform.cfg)
3. start eclipse
4. open the "about features" dialog

Observe: There is a "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0" feature.

5. open the update manager
6. create site bookmark to http://update.eclipse.org/updates
7. open categtory "Eclipse SDK 200205211339"
8. select feature "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0.200205211339"
9. hit Update and clear it to install the feature
10. say "Yes" when it asks to restart
eclipse exits and restarts
11. open the "about features" dialog

Observe: There is a mostly blank entry for some feature
with version "2.0.0.200205211339".
There is no "Eclipse Platform (Windows)" feature.

Expectation: Feature "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0.200205211339"
should be there.
12. Open the about plugins dialog

Observe: Plug-in "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0.200205211339"
is there.

13. Open update manager and inspect current configuration

Observe: Feature "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0.200205211339"
is configured, and "Eclipse Platform (Windows) 2.0.0" is disabled.

This makes me suspect the problem is with the about features dialog code,
rather than with the underlying configuration.


I have looked at this scenario and the problem would appear to be with the 
packaged feature on the update site. The plugin corresponding to the feature 
should have (by convention) the same version number as the feature. In this 
case the feature is org.eclipse.platform.win32_2.0.0.200205211339 and the 
corresponding plugins is org.eclipse.platform.win32_2.0.0.v20020521 (note the 
missing 1139 at the end). Should fix in the repackager (for feature plugins 
should be using the feature version rather than what is in the build-manifest).
The feature.xml explicitly gives the version id of its plug-ins. I don't think 
there should be any necessary correlation between the version id of the 
feature and the version id of the corresponding plug-in (if any). Why does the 
platform care?
Moving to update/core for resolution.
Have released changes to update and core.boot to keep track of both the feature 
version and the corresponding plugin version (if different) in the 
platform.cfg. The current API you are calling (IFeatureEntry.getFeatureVersion
()) will continue to return the feature version. There is a new API 
(IFeatureEntry.getFeaturePluginVersion()) that returns the version of the 
plugin. So you should be calling the new one for the About (because you are 
trying to get the attribution plugin).

Note: read the javadoc. I cannot guarantee that you will actually find the 
plugin in the registry. The user has many ways of injecting plugin versions 
into the install environment, and the runtime registry loading may load some 
other version of this plugin. So your code needs to handle the case where the 
registry has some other version of the plugin you are looking for, or has no 
version of the plugin. This should not happen in "normal" use, but can.

Code is in HEAD (core.boot, update.core). Should go into tomorrows build.
The code that displays the about box should be unconcerned by these 
complications. It should simply extract attribution info from the
plug-in in the plug-in registry with the same id as the feature.
If there is no plug-in with that id, the about box code should act
is if the feature requires no attribution.

Great .... sounds like I just spent time fixing something that did not need to 
be fixed (because it got moved to me to resolve). So, it seems like the About 
dialog can either

(1) always ignore any version information it gets from the configuration, and 
just lookup any old plugin matching the id

(2) use the plugin version information it gets from the configuration, and 
lookup the exact plugin.

In either case, if the plugin you are looking for is not in the registry (which 
could be the case in either scenario), then just ignore the feature on the 
About.
Have verified the support to get the correct plugin version is in 20020528. Over 
to the UI team to implement either (1) or (2) from prior post in the About 
dialog.
Changed logic to the following:
1. Given a feature id and version we try to find a plugin descriptor with a 
matching id and version. 
2. If none is found we try to find a plugin descriptor with a matching id
3. If none is found the feature does not appear in the about features dialog.</WithOutStack>

We currently download and install the feature files even if they already exist. 
The download part I am OK with, but the install is a potential timebomb. I have 
noticed that when we install nested features, the feature files for feature 1 
are installed before we start downloading files for feature 2. If the user 
cancels the operation, feature 1 is left in the feature9999999.xml state. If 
this was a feature that already existed prior to the install, we just blew it 
away.


Som we can download feature jar for features that are already installe (no 
harm) but we MUST NOT actually overwrite files for an existing feature (ie. we 
skip the install copy step for the feature files and only install diffed 
plugins)
We need to NOT install feature files if the feature already exists (what about
checking, do we check the file system for the directory or the plugin version,
b/c we can have a plugin org.plugin1 in com.company.plugin23_2.0.0 right)

Then we have to check the abort and remove doesn't remove the feature files
* if feature with same id &amp; version is already on site, skip file copy
* if not, check if &lt;id&gt;_&lt;version&gt;/feature.xml exists

    <WithStack>When importing lib jars into my project, I find that I'm always going through 
the same tedious motion to add them to the build path.  I'd like to request a 
checkbox on the import dialog, "add imported items to build path" that would, 
um, add the imported items to the build path.
there is no need to import JARs you reference them directly on the file system 
(either as an external JAR or via a variable).

Support for a Java aware importer is not planned for 2.0
Just to clarify why I think importing jars from the filesystem is a useful 
project construction strategy:  one of my chief complaints with VisualAge Java 
was its inability to maintain a common project workspace.  That is, each 
developer was responsible for adding all required projects to the workspace, 
and for maintaining the correct versions of these projects.  Eclipse overcomes 
this with external .jar (or variable reference).  

The flaw here comes from 
 a) developers that do not have network access to a lib directory, or
 b) developers are still responsible for acquiring and maintaining all project-
relevant jars.

By creating a project /lib directory and importing jars into the project (and

correct, I'm not against importing JARs and make them managed, but we still 
have no time for Java aware importer for 2.0
We should not implement a Java aware importer. Instead we should provide an 
action "Add to Build Path" on Jars that aren't already on the build path. This 
give use creater flixibility.

Consider for 2.1
added 'Add to Build Path' action (in context menu on JARs) &gt; 20021029</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>When importing lib jars into my project, I find that I'm always going through 
the same tedious motion to add them to the build path.  I'd like to request a 
checkbox on the import dialog, "add imported items to build path" that would, 
um, add the imported items to the build path.
there is no need to import JARs you reference them directly on the file system 
(either as an external JAR or via a variable).

Support for a Java aware importer is not planned for 2.0
Just to clarify why I think importing jars from the filesystem is a useful 
project construction strategy:  one of my chief complaints with VisualAge Java 
was its inability to maintain a common project workspace.  That is, each 
developer was responsible for adding all required projects to the workspace, 
and for maintaining the correct versions of these projects.  Eclipse overcomes 
this with external .jar (or variable reference).  

The flaw here comes from 
 a) developers that do not have network access to a lib directory, or
 b) developers are still responsible for acquiring and maintaining all project-
relevant jars.

By creating a project /lib directory and importing jars into the project (and 
maintaining them in source control), the common project organization is kept 
consistent and complete, and zero time is wasted in configuration.

1. Create the following CU:
/* Some comment before the package statement */
package p;

/* Some comment before the class declaration */
public class X {
}
2. Open in java editor
3. Show source of selected element only
4. In Outline, select p
Observe: The comment before p IS NOT shown
5. Select X
Observe: The comment before X IS shown.
This makes sense. We associate the preceeding comment with its declaration only for methods, 
fields and types. We don't do it for package declarations. If we want to do it, we can, but so far it is 
intentional.
So I guess we want the comment to be associated with the package declaration. I disagree with that, 
but if you want it, I will add it. My point is that this comment is very often related to the 
compilation unit and not the package declaration. So displaying it with the package declaration

Any comment?
I agree with you that this comment is mostly related to the cu. However in F1, 
you can never see this comment when in 'source of selected element only'. I 
thought that selecting the package declaration in the outline would show me 
this comment, but it showed only the package declaration statement which is the 
same information as in the outline. So maybe associating the comment to the 
package declaration would give additional value to the package declaration.
I still believe we should not display this comment when you select only the package declaration. 
The comment preceeding the package declaration should only be displayed when nothing is 
selected in the outliner.
I really don't like to associate a comment related to the compilation 
unit with the package fragment. Even worse the comment might simply be a copyright notice and then 
it is certainly not related to the package declaration.
When we added an association between 
non-javadoc comments and the following declaration (method, field or class), I was against this 
decision, because these comments are not part of the method, field or type declaration. Now we 
want to add comments preceeding the package declaration inside the package declaration. That 
means that if I remove the package declaration this comment will also be removed. If you have a 
copyright notice, you will certainly want to keep it even if you move your CU from one package to 
another package, won't you? If you answer yes, then we should not change anything.
Agreed. Please close.

    <WithStack>If we cannot find the JRE at startup, and that is because the file is not 
found (let's say the user typed a wrong path for instance ;-) we should say 
file not found (and pass the path of the VM) if the path is found, then we can 
say JRE/JDK not found in path
The executable prints out a long message to the user saying that it couldn't 
find the JRE/JDK and then prints out the path it looked in and tells the user 
to put it in their PATH.

Is this not what you want?
Yep, except for a user like me, who typed c:\j2sdk1.4..... instaed of d:\j2sdk, 
and who tries to change the end of the path (is that bin/ or jre/ or 
java.exe ??) instead of realizing the drive letter is wrong ;-)
I may be wrong (I do not have the code nor do I own it) but can't we do some 
ind of File.exists() ? (I am not even sure we have a valid VM at that point)

I was just logging that we may have 2 errors, 1) the file is not found 2) teh 
file is found but does not contain a JDK/JRE

Your call, no problem with me for a later or invalid ;-)
The code for the executable is written in C. We don't have a Java VM yet 
because this is the exe that we are looking for.

I don't feel that we should be doing an #exists() call on the parents of the 
path that the user specifies....either the path to java.exe that they pass in 
exists or it doesn't.

The executable currently prints out a message saying that the java.exe doesn't 
exist at the given path. I feel that this is all the user needs to know in 
order to check the path that they passed in.

    <WithStack>When you make an error in an Ant build file (in this case xml that is not well-

useful message in the console (first line below), followed by a very long stack 
trace.
- The stack trace is irrelevant here (but could be written to log).
- Could also have an error for hello.xml line 4 in the Eclipse Task view.

	at org.apache.tools.ant.ProjectHelper.configureProject
(ProjectHelper.java:85)

... etc etc etc
Defer until after release 2.0
Ant core is now passing along the original error message so we can display it 
in the error dialog instead of just "Build Failed" (see bug 21527).

Ant core is looking at not printing out the stack trace to the console, but 
instead to the log file (with maybe a message in the console that it was 
written there). Some exceptions trace are useful depending what when wrong.

No problem marker will be added to the task view. These type of markers cannot 
be deleted by the user, so we would need to manage these ourselves which is not 
possible if the ant build file reference by the tool is outside the workspace. 
We could just add a to do item to the task list, these can be deleted by the 
user. If you are interested in doing this work, please let me know (by opening 
a new bug report to explain the problem and the proposed solution). Right now, 
there are other higher priority items that we are working on.
Since we already rethrow errors we do not need to print them. The code has 
been removed.
I still think that some of the error dialogs provided by the UI should be more 
informative. For example, when a NoClassDefFoundError happens, the AntRunner 
throws a CoreException that wraps the original NoClassDefFoundError. The 
message in the CoreException tells the user to fix the Ant classpath but the 
original exception is hidden from the user (does not show in the dialog) and 
it usually contains important information like the name of the class that was 
not found. A details button showing information about the wrapped exception, 
IMO, is essential.
Clearing the later resolution
For classpath issues the name of the missing class is now displayed.
In general the nested exceptions (inside an InvocationTargetExcetpion etc) are 
now exposed and presented with the correct message in the error dialogs.
Please verify (Jared).

    <WithOutStack>This is a rare case, but it happened to me while cleaning up some SWT code with 
the refactoring tools and I had used a few anonymous inner classes in the SWT 
code.

Before the refactoring:
Select b and Refactor-&gt;Inline Local Variable

import org.eclipse.jface.action.Action;

public class X {
  
  public void foo(int a){  	
  	final int b= a;

Add a couple features
Go into .metadata/.config/platform.cfg.metadata/
Delete all files but LocalSite.xml
Start Eclipse
Eclipse should reconcile optimistic
See the *delete configuration*
You can revert to them &lt;ouch&gt;
Do not create dummy deleted configuration. Just log the problem.
InstallConfigurationModel#initialize()
InstallConfigurationModel#initialize() now throws an error if the File is not
found instead of changing the label.
The SiteLocal parser catches this error in SiteLocalParser#processConfig(). if
an error occurs retrieving a Configuration.xml, the configuration is not added
to the list of configurations.

Verified that bad XML are not shown and that deleted configuration are not shown
either.

What build are you using? It seems that you just need to set the right Ant 
classpath. Depending on the build you are using you have the following options 
to restore the classpath:
1) Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Ant-&gt;Customize-&gt;Restore Defaults
2) Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;External Tools-&gt;Ant-&gt;Restore Defaults

Let us know if that helps. Thanks.

Error dialog
Email from the bug reporter:

I am using F1, so 2) from below applies - but doesn't help. I have added a 
sceenshot of the error dialog to this bug 
(http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=940). If I rename 
the build.xml file, by the way, I can run ANT. Also if I rename the Project 
and then run ANT on the build.xml file, it works.

Please extract the attached workspace content in a different workspace then 
the default one.

Thanks,

The ExternalTools registry is caching the location of the tools. It is 
acceptable for *external* tools but in this case it is caching Ant scripts 
located inside the workspace. That prevents workspaces to be moved. This is a 
major problem. Recommend fixing for F2.
Run Ant... wizard now fills the external tool location field using the 
workspace_loc variable so as not to refer to the actual workspace directory.

When attempting to team/update a file on which an outgoing change was made, 
update does nothing, and doesn't surface it to the user.

Team/commit does complain if unable to proceed, would expect update to behave 
in a similar fashion.
This is how CVS works. Team/Update will load all remote changes into your local 
working copy.

If you are using Team/Update and you want to see which files have outgoing 
changes, open the CVS console before performing the update. The console will 
show the results of the update (which files had mergable conflicts, which ones 
had unmergable conflicts and which ones have outgoing changes).

Word of warning: Only use Team/Update if you know CVS. If there are "real" 
conflicts (i.e. those that effect the same line of a file) then CVS will add 
markup to the file during the update. Resolving these conflicts in this manner 
is not pleasant.

The above should be added to the doc somewhere
reworded title to indicate its a doc problem

Did you see a dialog telling you the build had failed, or simply an entry in 
the log ?
There was an error dialog - but I did not pay close attention to it.
This is a consequence of PDE discarding the .classpath file under you. An entry 
will still be entered in the log, anytime trying to read the classpath from the 
file. If no classpath is available, it will be equivalent to a default one.

The entry in the log is the way user can tell something went wrong. In case the 
classpath got broken resulting from a change, then a problem marker is added as 
well.

The "!" should be removed so that it checks if the target is in the list.

This fix is needed since when a JDIDebugTarget is created it adds itself to the
launch.  The super adapters do not want the JDIDebugTarget showing up in
the launch.
Even better code here is:
if (getDebugTargets0().remove(target)) {
  fireChanged();
}

remove() returns whether or not the element was removed. This saves us an 
iteration over the list.

Fixed. Please verify.

    <WithStack>With build 515, running the nl fragments, content assist accelerator does not 
work.  The settings for the accelerator seem fine.  I have remapped to verify 
content assist can be brought up and it works, just not with key names from 
languages other than english.  

For example, in Italian, the Space key value is Spazio.  This is not the same 
as the first release, which was BARRA SPAZIATRICE.  Neither of these work in 
2.0.  The ContentAssistProposal.label key has @Ctrl+Spazio, which is what I 
would expect.
The problem is with all accelerators that uses spaces on all non-English 
platforms but not with content assist (I used a locale specific Alt X in German 
that worked fine). I an replicate on German and Italian but not in Japanese 
which uses English accelerators. I get the same problem using Parameter Assist.

This appears to only be an issue with the space - accelerators with Ctrl, Shift 
and Alt seem fine. I don't beleive that this has anything to do with the 
Italian translation of space in org.eclipse.jface.properties as this is code 
only in there for backwards compatability.
Tod is this problem fixed by rolling back to the rollup 3 handling of 
accelerators?
This problem is solved by the internationalization support. This is still an 
issue in German due to a transaltion bug but it works for the other platforms.

See Bug 18073 for the current translation issues. You may close this PR - there 
is no more work required from the code side.

Please ignore the first attachment.  Bugzilla does not seem to handle bitmaps 
very well.
I can make this happen by setting the "Maximum number of compilation errors" to 
10.  When I set the value back to 100, the error goes away.
I saw the problem as well. I had changed all "Ignore" settings to 
"Warning".  I could rebuild without problem after doing a "Restore 
Defaults".

Reproduced. Fixed

Fix released to HEAD stream (WorkbenchPage)</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>- use the JUnit view as fast view
- run a testsuite
- doubleclick on a test in the hierarchy or on a line from a stacktrace of a 
failure - the appropriate editor gets focused
- minimize the JUnit view - the previously active editor gets the focus, which 
is not the expected behaviour
This probem is not JUnit/Java specific. The problem also shows up when using 
the Navigator as a fast view. To reproduce:

1) dock the Navigator as a fast view
2) open text files a.txt b.txt
3) activate a.txt
4) open Navigator and select b.txt
   -&gt;b.txt is selected
5) minimze the fast view
-&gt; a.txt is selected

    <WithStack>In the F1 build, if you open the Debug and Resource Perspective and click 
between them new debug action instances are being allocated every time the 
debug perspective is activated.

To recreate: 
 
Launch the F1 build, no workspace
Open the Debug perspective.
From OptimizeIt, do a global GC and mark the allocated objects.
Activate the Resource Perspective 
Activate the Debug Perspetive
Do a global GC

Notice that several org.eclipsedebug.interal.ui.Actions are being leaked

e.g. ResumeActionDelegate, 
RunHistoryMenuAction,DebugMenuHistoryAction,StepOverActionDelegate,StepReturnAct
ionDelegate.

See (possible) related action leak in bug #16384
Using a profiler, I found that realizing the debug or run drop down menu leaked 
actions. Specifically, everytime we realize the menu we get new instances of 
RelaunchHistoryLaunchAction, OpenDebugConfigurations, and 
DebugWithConfigurationAction. The menu is filled dynamically, and the old 
actions are never disposed.
Created attachment 1005
Screenshot of allocated actions
Attached screen shot of allocated actions when switching perspectives.
When will the fix be in?
Perspective Switching:
The AbstractListenerActionDelegate hierarchy was not being removed as selection 
listeners.
I believe I have plugged the leaks described in this bug.
I intend to do a little more profiling to find other critical leaks.
Please verify (DarinW) the problems identified here.
We will log other problems as found.

    <WithStack>The ChangeToPerspectiveMenu is not being disposed. To recreate:

Take the F1 build,
In the shortcut bar bring up the ChangeToPerspectiveMenu

From a memory profiler new instances of this menu are being created every time

Nick, this problem has been here for a while recall our discussion about 
disposing popup menus and the different SWT behavior between Win and Motif 
when. (ie. one platform returns immediately while the other call waits until 
the menu has been processed)
Need to create menu once for the window (can do so lazily).
Need to ensure listeners do not inadvertently hang on to perspective instances.
OK to hang onto descriptors, but ideally that should be avoided too.
Changed PerspectiveContributionItem to use a menu manager instead of creating 
and managing the menu itself.
Note that simply using MenuManager to create the menu each time will not fix 
the leak, since context menus hang around for the lifetime of the shell, unless 
they are set as the current menu of a control when it is disposed.

MenuManager actually caches the menu and returns it each time. It manages the 
menu item inside of it depending on the contribution items. No extra menu 
should be created now each time the menu is popup.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Accelerators that use Spaces (Content assist and parameter assist) do not work 
in Locales other than English (tested in German and Italian with the same 
results).
Also occurs in Traditional Chinese locale (zh_TW to be exact), but a workaround 
exists.

The Traditional Chinese IME in Win2k uses Ctrl-Space to switch in and out of 
IME mode but this key sequence can be disabled or remapped to something else in 
Control-Panel-&gt;Regional Options-&gt;Input Locales.

Once the key(s) is/are remapped, code completion works again (and parameter 
assist as well).
These are two different problems. On Chinese we cannot use Ctrl-Space for 
anything due to conflict with the mode switching.

The problem here is that Ctrl-Space does not work on locales where there is no 
problem - i.e. German and Italian.
Also Ctrl+Shift+T does not work in German but Ctrl+H does.
Are they using setAccelerator in the code?

Fixed some missing ones in Platform UI (New, Switch Perspective, Switch to 
Editor)
We have added the support for localized accelerators back into Action. It is 
still recommended that the accelerator is set using the accelerator key but not 
having the key is now reduced to a P4 rather than P1 issue.

There are still some translation issues.
Verification to be done against F3 fragments.
Marking a fixed as all remaining issues are to do with translations.
Marking as closed.</WithStack>

I'm not sure what it means ot open a file using "Welcome".
org.eclipse.ui/plugin.xml indicates that this is contributed by UI.
Moving to Platform/UI for comment.
This is the Welcome page (Help / Welcome).
Since it doesn't take input, it doesn't make sense to allow it to be chosen in 
the editor selection list.

If the user has the welcome page open, it is still a valid choice for the 
internal editors.  Nick's observation is also true for .class files, they do 
not allow input, yet the user will most likely want to access those types of 
files.  Thus the definition of an editor can not be determined by the users 
ability to change it's contents.

Additional approvements to welcome page will be covered by cheat sheets.</WithStack>

There is still a problem here, although the selection in the editor does not 
change, the selection in the outline still moves to the class name.

And actually when I tried this simple test case
1) Create a Class A with main
2) Add System.out.println(); to main, save
3) Replace with previous from local history
It worked (editor selection) for A but the problem returned for similar 
classes B and C I created next.

    <WithStack>I built a TableTree with three nested TableTreeItems.  

If I close the tree entirely and call showItem() on the 
innermost child, I get a null argument exception even though 
the child is not null.  

I don't get an exception if I expand the tree entirely, or if 
I call showItem() on the first or second level child items.  

I get the same results if I use setSelection().
Also calling showItem() successively from the higher level to lower level 
items (to "gradually" open the tree) produces the same exception.

i.e.
   ...
   TableTree     tree  = new TableTree(composite,SWT.FULL_SELECTION);

    <WithStack>In German the preference page for Label Decorations and the CVS decorator have 
a series of missing information messages on the titles in the list and on some 
of the widgets whereas others like Team or CVS are just shown in English.

We should just showthe English when we don't have the German.
Do Team and CVS have any translations?
Normally if there is a missing translation, we should just show the key string.
Reassigning to Cam for missing translations.

    <WithStack>Whenever BusyIndicator.showWhile() is used around a ProgressMonitorDialog, 
there are 1 pixel borders around the progress indicator that retain the default

To reproduce:
1) Check something out of CVS that will take around 10 seconds.
2) While the operation is in progress, mouse over the busy indicator.
3) Depending on how fast you moved the cursor, you will see the cursor flash

We have problems in English too, this is due to an SWT bug with multi-line

1. Open a Java editor and type "Thread.sleep(1);" in a method.
2. Hold SHIFT and press HOME to highlight the entire line.
3. Hit SHIFT+F10 to bring up the context menu.
4. Hit S to select "&amp;Source"
5. Hit T to select "Surround with &amp;try/catch" Note that instead of 
activating the "Surround with &amp;try/catch" menu item, the "Open &amp;type 
hierarchy" item is selected.

It appears that all visible menus are being queried for their mnemonics, so 
it thinks that two menu items have defined a mnemonic on T. However, we 
should only be looking in the deepest open menu (in this case, the menu 
under "&amp;Source").
Actually, I noticed that when you hit S in step 4 to expand the "Source" menu, 
the focus stays in the parent menu. If you hit S and then hit the up or down 
arrow, the selection changes in the parent menu.

When a child menu is activated, focus should switch to that menu.
Seems to be working now.  NOTE: I typed C instead of T (C for Copy and C for 
Add Constructors).  The constructors were added.  Even if this were not the 
case, we have no control over how GTK process mnemonics.
This is still broken in the 20030304 build. Another test case:
1. Press ALT+e to activate the top-level edit menu.
2. Press n to activate the Encoding submenu.
3. Nothing happens.

I tried this test case about a dozen times and it worked once but I could never
reproduce the correct behavior. This doesn't look like a GTK platform problem
because none of my other GTK2 apps (like Nautilus) have this bug. Unless this
has been fixed post-20030304, this should be reopened.
The original problem was in a context menu where there where duplicates.  The
problem you describe is in a pull down menu with no duplicates.  Can you open a
PR for this new problem?  Thanks.
Wait!  Is 25066 the same problem?  Seems to be.
Too late. :P I already filed Bug 33926. Anyway, in 25066, Steve says that
mnemonics from the toolbar menus work. Bug 33926 says they don't. :)</WithStack>

Delating .config doesn't work
Well, I would not expect to be able to execute the QNX code on XP, so the 
inability to restart is obvious.

However, this points out a more serious problem .... we actually allowed the 
install to proceed. We should not. We are not just downloading .zips to some 
download folder ... we are actually applying the changes to the running 
configuration, so we should not allow a feature that does not match the 
environment to be installed.
The checking should be done in [Install] enabling, as well as delta processing

    <WithStack>The WizardDialog ask's in showPage() or showStartingPage():
    if (page.getControl() == null)
to support a lazy page control creation.
This works fine when the wizard is called first time. After disposing a page 
page.getControl() still returns a (disposed) control and page.createControl
(pageContainer) is not called again.

I overwrote the method:
	public void dispose() {
	   super.dispose();
	   this.setControl(null);
	}
in all my pages as workaround. I suggest to add this method to WizardPage.
Moving to Platform UI.
Not sure where you would refer one of these pages after it is disposed. Please 
give a concrete example of why you need this.
I exentend the eclipse new wizard, with my own wizard. Later, depending on some 
input, I add some pages to that wizard. First time using this wizard everthing 
works fine.

Next time I use the new wizard it is not created again. The old wizard is 
reused instead. WizardPages which was added while creating the wizard works 
fine, pages added later produces null pointer exception.

I analyzed that closing this wizard, dispose at least the pages added later!

Upping to P2.
I am not sure how you are reusing your wizards. We create a new instance 
everytime the dialog is invoked - are you doing this via the wizard dialog 
that uses the values in plugin.xml or are you caching this value yourself?
I just added a wizard at extension point org.eclipse.ui.newWizards. 
My wizard has own private members. I debugged the wizard using a breakpoint 
inside the wizard. The content of the members was not reseted after closing the 
wizard and opening it again. So the new wizard reuses the same instance of my 
wizard!
 
I checked this at 2002-05-22. I have not verified it with the current version 
of eclipse. 
Looking at the code for creating a new wizard we have this is 
PluginDescriptor - so we create a new instance of a wizard everytime it is 
invoked. The only time it is reused is if you go back in the wizard and then 
reselect.

public Object createExecutableExtension(String className, Object initData, 
IConfigurationElement cfig, String propertyName) throws CoreException {

	try {
		classInstance = getPluginClassLoader(true).loadClass
	Object result = null;
	try {
		result = classInstance.newInstance();
Then, the problem remains if you reselect the wizard. Maybe I have memorized 
this incorectly.
This is not something that we would want to do generally then - Eclipse 
wizards are designed such that going back and then forward again should not 
cause any information loss.

We would not call dispose in that case regardless so this wouldn't buy us 
anything. It is only worth adding the dispose() method if we are going to do 
something by default.
When you should not call dispose on the wizardpage when going back from my 
wizard to the your new wizard!
Ok so the real problem then is that we are disposing too often (i.e. when we 
go back)?
Yes I think so. The problem is that the later added pages are disposed when 
pressing back at the first page of the my wizard. Pages added before starting 
the wizard works fine.
Renaming PR to get at the gist of the issue.

When we return to the new page and then reselect an entry in the page we throw 
out the previous wizard and create a new one. It would be better if we kept 
any wizard we had already created and reused it.

STEPS
1) Select New-&gt;Project-&gt;Simple-&gt;Project
2) Hit next
3) Hit Back
4) Reselect Project in the new dialog
5) New instance is created rather than reusing the old one.

    <WithStack>Build 20020521 with 20020515 fragments

When I Switch tpo the Install/Update perspective in German I get a message box 
that says "The markup in the document following the root element must be well 
formed".

STEPS
1) Start Eclipse in German with German fragments
2) Select Fenster-&gt;Perspektiv öffnen-&gt;Install update
3) You get the message

The problem appears to be in the Install new features part of the Preview text
Where can we get the fragments? They are not posted on eclipse.org
and the .log which should contain the trace
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The markup in the document following the root

If the .classpath file cannot be read properly (missing or ill-formatted), the 
Java project cannot be populated due to an exception traversing it.

It should revert to an empty classpath and log an entry.
Fixed. Also added a marker if reconciling with bogus .classpath file.

Not sure if Debug is the correct component, it may be JDT or PDE

Note you will need an "old" workspace to run for step 8.

1. Open Eclipse on a new workspace
2. Import all plugins and features except org.eclipse.ui
3. Load org.eclipse.ui from head
4. Switch to the debug perspective and Run a runtime workbench (just
accept a default new configuration).

Perform the following steps in the runtime workbench

5. Import all plugins and features except org.eclipse.ui
6. Load org.eclipse.ui from head
7. Open an org.eclipse.ui java file and make a noticeable change
(ex. AboutPluginsDialog.configureShell set the shell text to "Test")
8. Switch to the debug perspective and Run a runtime workbench (this time 
enter the location of an old workspace in the workspace data field).

9. When the workspace opens note that the change is not present (ex. 
Help&gt;About Eclipse Platform&gt;About Plugins the title has not changed).

Observations
1. If instead of running an old workspace you create another (ex. D:\20020521
\runtime-workspace\runtime-workspace) it works as expected
2. If in workbench opened in step 4. go to the Resource Navigator and navigate 
to the .class file of the file you changed. Trying to open it produces a 
dialog saying that its folder does not exist. Refreash does not help this. 
The .class file does exsist in the file system.
3. This is the scenario I commonly use for development to ensure that I am 
working with the latest UI code. This scenario worked with most previous 
builds.

did not move this sooner - not sure if this is still a problem).

This is a regression - it was not a problem until very recent builds.

- open an editor (either text or Java)
- select a word
- type ^F to bring up the Find/Replace dialog
- your word is in the "Find:" field
- in the "Replace With:" field, type another word (for example, "splat")
- click on the "Replace" button

The bug is that the "Find:" field in the dialog now contains the word "splat".
This can be misleading if you then try to do another Find - particularly if the 
user did not notice that the Find text was replaced. They might think that the 
original search string was not found. It is also inconvenient for the user if 
they did notice that their original string is now gone, because they have to 
either type it in again to keep searching, or they have to go to the Find combo 
box to get it back.

Other places where this bug shows up:
- open a text file with multiple instances of the string "foo".
- bring up the Find/Replace dialog
- type "bar" in the Replace With field
- now repeatedly click the "Replace/Find" button until all instances of "foo" 
in the file have been replaced with "bar".
The bug: after replacing the last instance of "bar", the "Find:" string in the 
dialog suddenly turns into "bar".

One more example:
- open a text file with multiple instances of the string "foo".
- bring up the Find/Replace dialog
- type "bar" in the Replace With field
- click "Replace All"
The bug: the "Find:" string is now "bar".

Coolbar redraws too frequently.  Need to see if we can do anything here.

This is my code.  I can be smarter about setting redraw on/off for the CoolBar

Opened SWT PR [Bug 17994] New: Coolbar - gripper flash
Code included a setRedraw call in response to the workaround for 14330 (added 
item to a locked coolbar gets a gripper) - didn't want flash/redraw when 
temporarily changing the locked state of coolbar.  Doing so is not necessary - 
there's no noticeable flash/redraw when changing locked state.  Was also 
calling setRedraw unnecessarily (i.e., not just when adding items).  Removed 
setRedraw calls.  There is much less overall flash.  The only remaining flash 
is the grippers (opened SWT PR above).
