    <WithStack>I set up a project with target site defined to be ftp://rogue.oti.com and tried 
to get the site.  This triggered the error shown in the attached bitmap.  This 
does not happen why I get the site using dreamweaver.  I can only suspect that 
maybe we keep a single session open and they open a new session for each file?
Created attachment 1132
Bitmap showing error
Actually now I am wondering if it is failing randomly and it is not a server 
limit error at all.  I just tried another directory and it failed after 7 files 
(see attached bitmap).

Created attachment 1133
Bitmap showing second error after only 7 files
It's not a server limit. This is the message that you get when you log out of
the FTP server; apparently we are mis-parsing it as an error when in fact it's
purely informational. I think there may have been a PR about this somewhere.
Oddly it seems to only happen when getting certain directories...

    <WithStack>The default behavior for chevrons on a win32 platform is for the chevron to 
stay pushed while the popup menu is displayed.

This can be fixed with a simple code change.  The RBN_CHEVRONPUSHED message 
needs to be processed immediately for the chevron to stay pushed instead of 
being posted to the queue for later processing.

In the CoolBar.wmNotifyChild() method, changing child.postEvent() to 
child.sendEvent() will rectify the problem.
Steve, since we are not going to fix Bug#18403  we also should close this PR as 
WONTFIX.

Just to let you know, the fix posted here will cause the chevron to stay pushed 
as expected, but if you have multiples chevrons showing at the same time and 
click on them all they will all stay pushed, only one (the last) will be 
showing the menu though.

Agree.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The default behavior for ToolItems with a DROP_DOWN style on a win32 platform 
is for the arrow to stay pushed while the popup menu is displayed.

This can be fixed with a simple code change.  The TBN_DROPDOWN message needs 
to be processed immediately for the arrow part of the ToolItem to stay pushed 
instead of being posted to the queue for later processing.

In the ToolBar.wmNotifyChild() method, changing child.postEvent() to

Thanks.  You are right but there are issues surrounding send vs post for 
SWT.Selection events.  It think your change is good and should go in but it is 
way to late in the freeze cycle for R2.0 to risk it.
we should re-consider this for 2.1

Changing this the post to the send will no longer fix the problem for menus in 
2.1 because Menu.setVisible() defers the menu pop up to the event loop.  This 
is to be consistent with the other platforms where pop up menus do not start a 
modal menu loop in the application code but instead, run from 
Display.readAndDispatch()).

I don't believe we should change this (sorry Rob).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>As far as I can tell, no command variables are being passed to the external 
program.  I tried both current project location and selected resource 
location.  I set up an external program with both c:\windows\write.exe and 
c:\windows\command.com and neither seems to be passed the variable contents.  
Although if I type a specific non-variable parameter into the "Tool Arguments" 
field, that works.
Build was 0530 integration build.

Need to ensure that all the variables we claim to support are working for F2.
Please verify.
Checked build 0609, using NT and Win98.
As far as I can tell this is *not* working.
I configured an external tool definition for wordpad.exe (write.exe on win98).
I tried both the following variables:
selected resource location
selected resource full path

It appears that no parameters are being passed to the program.
If I type a constant parameter into the dialog then it works.

i wrote a program, c:\args.cmd, which looks like this:

echo [0] %0
echo [1] %1
echo [2] %2
echo [3] %3
echo [4] %4
echo [5] %5
echo [6] %6
echo [7] %7
echo [8] %8
echo [9] %9

a created ten tools from this program, one for each of the first ten variables 
as the tool's single argument. from my workspace (built from importing the 
plugins), i selected in navigator a file resource: "plugin.xml" 
under "org.junit".

i ran each tool on this selection with the following results (as displayed in 
the log console; irrelevant details omitted):

args ${workspace_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace

args ${project_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace/org.junit

args ${container_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace/org.junit

args ${resource_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace/org.junit/plugin.xml

args ${project_path}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] /org.junit

args ${container_path}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] /org.junit

args ${resource_path}

args ${container_name}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] org.junit

args ${resource_name}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] plugin.xml

wordpad:

now i created two tools using wordpad (C:\Program Files\Windows 
NT\Accessories\wordpad.exe), the first using ${resource_loc} as its argument. 
with the same selection as above, wordpad launches the file correctly.
i am not able to repeat your problem for this case. 

the second, using ${resource_path} as its argument, causes wordpad to launch, 
but wordpad is unable to launch the file so it starts with a blank document. 
this is also correct behavior according to the above tests. wordpad cannot 
find "/org.junit/plugin.xml"

(note: it is unfortunate that the full path variables always have a leading 
slash, otherwise i could have been able to launch in this case by specifying 
${workspace_loc} as the working directory.)

there are a two areas where you may have had problems (i stumbled on both of 
them myself):

potential issue #1: paths with spaces

eclipse has no problem executing applications with spaces in the path. quotes 
are not required. interpretation of arguments, of course, is up to the tool 
itself, and occasionally a tool will fail on a filename containing spaces
unless it is explicitly quoted. eclipse does not seem to quote arguments with 
spaces, and i feel that this is correct behavior. wordpad will fail on 
filenames containing spaces unless explicitely quoted. this may have happened 
in your case. 

potential issue #2: selection bug

try the args ${resource_loc} example above again. make sure to select a 
resource first. notice that the current view (probably navigator if you just 
selected a resource) deactivates when the tool is run. when the tool finishes, 
the view doesn't reactivate. notice the resource is still selected, but colored 
gray. try running the tool again. the argument expands to an empty string as 
the view does not return a selected resource. try this with the wordpad 
${resource_loc} example and you will get a blank document. 

finally, a note about the variable terminology:

as a regular user, my first thought is that "full path" and "location" should 
be swapped. "full path" intuitively means an absolute path on a file system, 
while "location" is a more abstract notion - more useful a term to describe a 
relative position within a domain-specific semantic construct like 'workspace'
external tools is not to blame: during variable expansion it correctly 
delegates to IResource.getFullPath() and IResource.getLocation() respectively, 
and i think the ui is correct to match its terminology to core resources
public api. i do find it curious why core resources didn't swap these terms.

summary:
1. i will log the leading slash comment and the selection bug to platform ui.
2. i will log the comment regarding confusing terminology to core resources.
3. i will log a note to platform docs requesting special attention to 
explaining variable names and the issue with filenames containing spaces.
Quoting the argument fixed the problem.
However users are going to run into trouble for the reasons you outline:
1) Without quotes some apps don't work and you have no clue why.  I wonder why 
we don't just insert the quotes into the text area for the arguments by 
default?  The user can always remove them.

2) The terminology for the arguments is confusing and conterintuitive - we need 
a better way to indicate what exactly will be passed as the argument - perhaps 
we could show what would be passed given the current selection, or provide a 
test area so you can click on something and see what happens.

Actually, it only worked the first time.  After some experimentation I 
discovered I had to re-click on the item in the list to make it work again.
I am reopening the report because there is still a real problem here.

Ryan was looking at quoting the arguments being passed (both for location and 
path variables). It was not part of friday's build.

I agree, we exposed the core terminology in the UI - coming up with better 
names for these would help.

The lost of focus may come from the use of a progress monitor. This problem may 
go away if we can run without a progress monitor.
The variables are now working.
The selection problem and the terminology will have to wait until post 2.0.
Post 2.0.
Reopened for investigation
This is fixed in the new external tool support.

Note: new external tool work is not yet released to the head stream and won't 
for a while yet.</WithStack>

a created ten tools from this program, one for each of the first ten variables 
as the tool's single argument. from my workspace (built from importing the 
plugins), i selected in navigator a file resource: "plugin.xml" 
under "org.junit".

i ran each tool on this selection with the following results (as displayed in 
the log console; irrelevant details omitted):

args ${workspace_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace

args ${project_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace/org.junit

args ${container_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace/org.junit

args ${resource_loc}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] C:/eclipse-SDK-20020607-win32/eclipse/workspace/org.junit/plugin.xml

args ${project_path}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] /org.junit

args ${container_path}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] /org.junit

args ${resource_path}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] /org.junit/plugin.xml

args ${project_name}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] org.junit

args ${container_name}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] org.junit

args ${resource_name}
[0] c:\args.cmd
[1] plugin.xml

wordpad:

now i created two tools using wordpad (C:\Program Files\Windows 
NT\Accessories\wordpad.exe), the first using ${resource_loc} as its argument. 
with the same selection as above, wordpad launches the file correctly.
i am not able to repeat your problem for this case. 

the second, using ${resource_path} as its argument, causes wordpad to launch, 
but wordpad is unable to launch the file so it starts with a blank document. 
this is also correct behavior according to the above tests. wordpad cannot 
find "/org.junit/plugin.xml"

(note: it is unfortunate that the full path variables always have a leading 
slash, otherwise i could have been able to launch in this case by specifying 
${workspace_loc} as the working directory.)

there are a two areas where you may have had problems (i stumbled on both of 
them myself):

potential issue #1: paths with spaces

eclipse has no problem executing applications with spaces in the path. quotes 
are not required. interpretation of arguments, of course, is up to the tool 
itself, and occasionally a tool will fail on a filename containing spaces
unless it is explicitly quoted. eclipse does not seem to quote arguments with 
spaces, and i feel that this is correct behavior. wordpad will fail on 
filenames containing spaces unless explicitely quoted. this may have happened 
in your case. 

potential issue #2: selection bug

try the args ${resource_loc} example above again. make sure to select a 
resource first. notice that the current view (probably navigator if you just 
selected a resource) deactivates when the tool is run. when the tool finishes, 
the view doesn't reactivate. notice the resource is still selected, but colored 
gray. try running the tool again. the argument expands to an empty string as 
the view does not return a selected resource. try this with the wordpad 
${resource_loc} example and you will get a blank document. 

finally, a note about the variable terminology:

as a regular user, my first thought is that "full path" and "location" should 
be swapped. "full path" intuitively means an absolute path on a file system, 
while "location" is a more abstract notion - more useful a term to describe a 
relative position within a domain-specific semantic construct like 'workspace'
external tools is not to blame: during variable expansion it correctly 
delegates to IResource.getFullPath() and IResource.getLocation() respectively, 
and i think the ui is correct to match its terminology to core resources
public api. i do find it curious why core resources didn't swap these terms.

summary:
1. i will log the leading slash comment and the selection bug to platform ui.
2. i will log the comment regarding confusing terminology to core resources.
3. i will log a note to platform docs requesting special attention to 
explaining variable names and the issue with filenames containing spaces.
Quoting the argument fixed the problem.
However users are going to run into trouble for the reasons you outline:
1) Without quotes some apps don't work and you have no clue why.  I wonder why 
we don't just insert the quotes into the text area for the arguments by 
default?  The user can always remove them.

2) The terminology for the arguments is confusing and conterintuitive - we need 
a better way to indicate what exactly will be passed as the argument - perhaps 
we could show what would be passed given the current selection, or provide a 
test area so you can click on something and see what happens.

Actually, it only worked the first time.  After some experimentation I 
discovered I had to re-click on the item in the list to make it work again.
I am reopening the report because there is still a real problem here.

Ryan was looking at quoting the arguments being passed (both for location and 
path variables). It was not part of friday's build.

I agree, we exposed the core terminology in the UI - coming up with better 
names for these would help.

The lost of focus may come from the use of a progress monitor. This problem may 
go away if we can run without a progress monitor.
The variables are now working.
The selection problem and the terminology will have to wait until post 2.0.
Post 2.0.
Reopened for investigation
This is fixed in the new external tool support.

Note: new external tool work is not yet released to the head stream and won't 
for a while yet.</WithOutStack>

0. Import x.jar from external location and add the JAR to the build path
   ==&gt; x.jar as INTERNAL JAR
1. Drill into a package where class C is visible
2. Remove x.jar from build path (not from project)

5. Delete C from the external JAR
6. Refresh the project

Same scenario works if started with 3.
If enabling delta tracing, you'll see that the correct delta got notified.

However, the package view listener doesn't check for this change, and thus 
doesn't refresh.

I got it to work fine when changing JavaElementContentProvider#processDelta as

statement):

That's what we see too BUT when getting the JAR it seams to return old (cached?)
values.
Created attachment 1136
p1.zip lib containing X and Y
Created attachment 1137
p1.zip lib containing only X type
Using attached archives, and if doing precisely:


0. Import p1.zip from external location and add the JAR to the build path
   ==&gt; p1.zip as INTERNAL JAR
1. Drill into a package where class Y is visible
2. Remove p1.zip from build path (not from project)
3. Add p1.zip as EXTERNAL JAR
4. Drill into the package where class Y is visible
5. Switch p1.zip with the one not containing X and Y
6. Refresh the project
==&gt; Y is gone

dani can you pls try reproduce
I can reproduce it every time (note: I test on what's in JDT HEAD plus newest
jdtcore export from Dirk). I do the steps quickly after each other.

0. Export attached x.jar to c:\
1. Fresh workspace
2. Create Ja project "JUnit"
3. Import x.jar from file system c:\ (as single file)
4. Add x.jar to the build path
5. Open junit.samples.VectorTest
6. Remove x.jar from the build path (press OK)
7. Add external c:\JAR x.jar to the build path
8. Open junit.samples.VectorTest
9. Open c:\x.jar with winzip, delete VectorTest.java, close winzip
10. Select project "JUnit" in packages view press F5
==&gt; VectorTest remains in Packages view
Note: Close the project, reopen it: now VectorTest is gone

Created attachment 1139
x.jar
Aahh - the main difference is that you switch the zips while I EDIT the external
zip.

No the problem is that the external JAR is located in the root folder, and that 
platform API IContainer#findMember("c:/x.jar") may answer the corresponding 
internal JAR instead.

When trying to reproduce, my jar was located in a "c:/zz/x.jar".

Now we found one issue in our code, which was incorrectly calling for for 
IProject.findMember(...) instead of using the root. This is why we did 
misbehave in this one case. So this defect is fixed, but the platform bug 
remains (bug 17209).

Moving to platform/core for further investigation

Same scenario works if started with 3.
If enabling delta tracing, you'll see that the correct delta got notified.

Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN}
	Proj1[*]: {CHILDREN}

However, the package view listener doesn't check for this change, and thus 
doesn't refresh.

I got it to work fine when changing JavaElementContentProvider#processDelta as

statement):

pls verify
hmm, i closed the welcome page and it's gone now - cannot open anymore
cannot verify:
i have 
.no 'open java perspective' on the welcome page
.no 'welcome...' menu entry

looking at the code:
IJavaProject jproject= element.getJavaProject();
fHierarchy= jproject.newTypeHierarchy(region, pm);				

this still explodes if element is of type IJavaModel

x
x</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>To support opening a Java perspective from the Welcome page it should handle 
the case when it is opened with a JavaModel.

This is the call to open the perspective in OpenJavaPerspectiveAction
window.openPage(JavaUI.ID_PERSPECTIVE, JavaCore.create
(ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot()));


This is the NPE

yes
configure: creating ./config.status

config.status: error: cannot find input file: \.in


Also I have seen some interlocking in cygwin and cmd.exe processes - and think
this problem maybe in Eclipse CDT usage of them.
The generated Makefile.am(s) contains lines like the following:

SOURCES = dir1 \
dir2 \
.
.
etc..

that uses the "\" continuation character which autoconf/automake on cygwin  - 
for some reason -  does not accept.  So, check all your Makefile.am(s) - you 
will find one in each dir-  and if you have lines containing the continuation 
character, changed as follows:
SOURCES = dir1 dir2 . ..... etc. 
This, I believe, has been resolved in the latest autoconf automake versions - 
2.53 and 1.6 - although they contain lots of problems and I don't recommend 
using them at this moment.
Hope this solve the problem but If you find that it did not, you may reopen the

Forgot to add the build id. As the date may indicate this problem is reported

pls check with Martin before releasing
This only happens when you run in debug mode. The ModalContext thread is 
producing the walkback on the console.

See ModalContext#run(....)

if (debug) {
	System.err.println("Exception in modal context operation:");
	throwable.printStackTrace();
	System.err.println("Called from:");//$NON-NLS-1$
	// Don't create the InvocationTargetException on the throwable,
	// otherwise it will print its stack trace (from the other thread).
	new InvocationTargetException(null).printStackTrace();
}

Even in debug mode we should ignore OperationCanceledException since they are 
thrown on purpose.

Moving down to UI.

Cancelling the open type operation (while it is searching for all type names) 
results in the following stack trace (not sure who is writting it):

Exception in modal context operation:
Called from:

Logging is done by ModalContext#run, but the sender should also catch 
OperationCancelledException:

at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.dialogs.TypeSelectionDialog$1.run
(TypeSelectionDialog.java:165)

			IRunnableWithProgress runnable= new 
IRunnableWithProgress() {
				public void run(IProgressMonitor monitor) 
throws InvocationTargetException, InterruptedException {
					try {
						AllTypesCache.getTypes(fScope, 
fElementKinds, monitor, typeList);
					} catch (JavaModelException e) {
						throw new 
InvocationTargetException(e);
					}
					if (monitor.isCanceled()) {
						throw new InterruptedException
();
					}
pls check with Martin before releasing
This only happens when you run in debug mode. The ModalContext thread is 
producing the walkback on the console.

See ModalContext#run(....)

if (debug) {
	System.err.println("Exception in modal context operation:");
	throwable.printStackTrace();
	System.err.println("Called from:");//$NON-NLS-1$
	// Don't create the InvocationTargetException on the throwable,
	// otherwise it will print its stack trace (from the other thread).
	new InvocationTargetException(null).printStackTrace();
}

Even in debug mode we should ignore OperationCanceledException since they are 
thrown on purpose.

Moving down to UI.
Fixed.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Build 0530, WindowsXP Japanese, FTP server AIX 4.3.3 Ja_JP locale

STEPS
1) right click for a project and select "Deploy" - "Configure Site..."
2) Select FTP for a repository site
3) input URL, User and password for the FTP server
4) right click for a DBCS named file and select "Deploy" - "Put"

The file name was created as UTF-8, so the name has been bogus.
ftp from WinXP console successfully can put the DBCS file name.
User is using target management plugin with FTP target provider.
Moving to Platform/VCM for comment.
James to investigate
Class ControlConnection uses an InputStream/OutputStream pair. I suspect it
should be using a Reader/Writer pair instead, with the appropriate encoding set.
We do a similar thing for CVS. Shouldn't be hard to fix, would require some testing.
(reworded title to denote FTP specific)
Fix is ready.
Verified by MV. Released.

Java Editors use IFileEditorInput and thus rely on workbench mechanisms. 
However the problem is not critical as the behavior the user observes is 
correct and does not result in any further error. Moving to platform.
That is the expected behaviour. But we should not log anything to the log file.

!MESSAGE Test does not exist.
Java Editors use IFileEditorInput and thus rely on workbench mechanisms. 
However the problem is not critical as the behavior the user observes is 
correct and does not result in any further error. Moving to platform.
That is the expected behaviour. But we should not log anything to the log file.

    <WithStack>I've downloaded the F1 release.

I set
Java-Editor-Appearance: Insert Spaces for tab -&gt;checked

and the tab key isn't working in the editor. There is also no indention, when
you press &lt;enter&gt; and switch to a new line.

If "Insert Spaces for tab" is unchecked every thing works fine.

This bug occure the first time in F1-Release. M5-Release worked fine both ways.

The setting of Java-CodeFormatter-Style: "Indetion is represented by tab" is
independend from this error.

Strange...
since it is not reproducable opt for no action for 2.0
Suspect an part activation problem, as there is explicit code that prohibits 
selection changes when the editor is the active part. Thus, if the selection 
changed, the test must have failed.

    <WithStack>If you click on the marker bar in a field line a popup appears that lets you 
add a breakpoint. If no executable code exists in this line a breakpoint is 
added in the closer location. It would be more useful in that circumnstance to 
allow entering a watchpoint instead of a breakpoint. If that is not possible or 
in addition it would be nice to add this option to the contextual menu when 
clicking on a field. Now the only way to add a watchpont is from the Run menu.

Furthermore if a watchpoint exists and you click on it the popup uses 
the "breakpoint" term instead of "watchpoint".
It is unlikely at this stage we will be adding new features (adding a 
watchpoint from the ruler context menu).

It would be possible to label the actions with "* Watchpoint" instead of "* 
Breakpoint".

Note that watchpoints can be added via the context menu when a field is 
selected.  For example, in the outliner or the packages view.

Notice that eclipse is misspelled eclispe.
For some reason, you are missing JDT UI plug-in and your plug-in was disabled 
because of that. 

Maybe you accidentaly removed JDT UI plug-in or disabled it in the launcher. Go 
to 'Plugins and Fragments' tab of the launcher and verify that it 
org.eclipse.jdt.ui is selected. 
James, you 'fixed' it :-).

Fix the typo in JDT UI import element and things should work.

    <WithStack>I've tried the examples for the ScrolledComposite from
the javadoc on the iPAQ an it is very slow. After touching
the slider it took 2 sec to move the slider to the new position

I've tried the old examples (displaying 10 buttons) and the

Hi Chris

I've tried three examples of the ScrolledComposite. Two examples
are in the old javadoc (display 10 Buttons) and one in the new
javadoc (two ScrolledComposite widgets and one button to add
a button into each widget). All example are VERY slow on the iPAQ.
I've tried SWT because the ScrollPane in the AWT implementation
is also very slow.
Then I've modified the first two examples in that way, that
I'm placing the Components on my own and don't use a LayoutManager.
The speed is much better and I can scroll through the page while it
is repainted. With the LayoutManager you weren't even able to
move the slider.
If you need the code, look into the Javadocs of ScrolledComposite.

- ScrolledComposite is currently unusable because on WinCE the child composite 
receives WM_SIZE events every time the scrollbar is pressed - causing the 
layout to relayout if a layout has been specified.

Fix to be checked-in after Eclipse 2.0 (currently frozen)

Feature on WinCE.  In SetWindowPos, SWP_DRAWFRAME is equivalent to 
SWP_FRAMECHANGED. MSDN says that when this flag is specified, WinCE redraws 
the entire non-client area of the window, which may change the size of the 
client area. It has been verified that a WM_SIZE event is sent even if
SWP_NOSIZE was set. The fix is to not specify SWP_DRAWFRAME when SWP_NOSIZE is 
specified.

Control.java
void setBounds (int x, int y, int width, int height, int flags) {

Polyline does not respond to setBounds().  The reason is because it calculates 
its own bounds as a function of its PointList.

Supporting both setBounds() and setPoints() would be troublesome because 
setting the Points after you have positioned the Polyline would move it to 
wherever the new points are.  It would be a last-one-in-wins scenario.

We could investigate making this work, but getPreferredSize() could not be 
implemented without laying-out the connection, which is the reverse of the 
typical validate order.  You would have to layout the connection to know how 
the decorations affect the total size.
Maybe I misunderstand something, but is there a workaround possible today?

I want do create customized figures with Polylines. Currently points of 
Polylines must be absolute coordinates? So it won't be possible to use these 
figures for EditParts?

What do you suggest? Do I have to create my own figure implementation extending 
Shape?

I don't want to use fixed images for the EditPart figures because I want to use 
zoom functionality later.
More info on the newsgroup.
This is the same issue as 27227. I should have marked that one as the 
duplicate, but it's already closed.

    <WithStack>When you

- create a Java launch configuration,
- choose not to use the default path,
- and make the boot path empty,

the vm is launched without -Xbootclasspath option, resulting in the default 
system class library to be used instead of an empty boot path.

This is most likely not a problem in practice, but I am not sure this is 
intended behavior.
This is a bug.
Fixed. Had to change API on

* AbstractJavaLaunchConfigurationDelegate#getBootpath(). It can now return null 
to indicate default BP, or an emptry array to indicate empty
* VMRunnerConfiguration set/getBootClassPath - also accepts null/empty
Please verify
There is a problem here, that may be somewhat unrelated:

- Uncheck use default boot path
- 
Add
JRE to classpath
- Launch and notice command line doesn't show an empty -Xbootclasspath:
- 
Now
add some other project to bootpath in config
- Launch and notice that now there is a -

Xbootclasspath: entry, but it shows
both the project and the JRE that was put on 
the
classpath.

Note that if you uncheck use default bootpath, delete whatever entries 
are
there, then launch, you do see the empty -Xbootclasspath: in the command line (event though 
launch
fails because JRE lib can't be found)

    <WithStack>we delete fields by calling 'delete' in a loop
(unlike other members which we delete all in one go by using text edits)

this results in:
. multiple builds when you have the editor closed
. multiple local history entries

(not sure how to fix though)
can you do it inside a workbench runnable?
defer
The workbench runnable might reduce the numbers of builds to one. Deleting a 
field is done via JDOM (AFAIK) which save the file.

So why don't we use the same code as we use to delete methods ?
Adam, can you test if this still exists. If so we should ask Java Core how to 
avoid this.

default) using the PDE launcher
2. Added a new JRE (upgraded to latest IBM) and made it the default
3. Removed the old one
4. Tried to launch the configuration from step 1

I would expect it to either pick the default one or prompt that the JRE it was 
set to was gone. What happened was that the launch fails (leaves an entry in 
the debug view) with no message and no log. When I edit the launch 
configuration, it then shows me one of the existing ones (but not the default 
one, which is what I would expect). After I set the JRE, everything works fine.
Moving to PDE. The java application launcher handles this case and reports an 
error to the user (missing JRE). The PDE lanucher should do the same.
F3 candidate.
Implemented - will detect missing JVM and report it as error.</WithStack>

Hi Chris

I've tried three examples of the ScrolledComposite. Two examples
are in the old javadoc (display 10 Buttons) and one in the new
javadoc (two ScrolledComposite widgets and one button to add
a button into each widget). All example are VERY slow on the iPAQ.
I've tried SWT because the ScrollPane in the AWT implementation
is also very slow.
Then I've modified the first two examples in that way, that
I'm placing the Components on my own and don't use a LayoutManager.
The speed is much better and I can scroll through the page while it
is repainted. With the LayoutManager you weren't even able to
move the slider.
If you need the code, look into the Javadocs of ScrolledComposite.

Hi,

I want to write a small app for the iPAQ.
Because sometimes I have to display more
information than fits to the screen I
need something like a ScrollPane. I've
tried the ScrolledComposite example
described in the javadoc (okay, for testing
I'm using 100 labels). It works on 
the desktop but when I run this example
on the iPAQ it's VERY slow. Touching the
arrow it lasts 2 seconds to readraw the
screen,  moving the slider lasts even
more (&gt;8sec). The first time I thought my
iPAQ crashed because nothing happened.
Is this a bad example to get a scrollable
workspace on the iPAQ? Is there another
way to get this thing working?

When importing a zipfile, I entered the prefix for the file name 'd:/s' inside 
the first input field 'Zip file', intending to give a clue to the next [browse] 
action I performed.

An error dialog popped up claiming that the file had the wrong format ?! 
(message should have said it did not exist)... but anyway, I think it should 
have picked the content of the field, and used it as a first guess before

After the user expands a set of buttons, they have to fix up every set of 
buttons to the right of the expanded set. This is the wrong behavior.

For an example:
1. Turn on autobuilding.
2. Position the sets of buttons in the coolbar such that all buttons are 
visible and all sets of buttons are left-justified (this is standard 
layout).
3. Turn off autobuilding. The "build" button is added to the leftmost set 
of buttons, but since there isn't enough room for it, we create a chevron 
which contains the build button.
4. Now try to fix up your layout so that it looks like it did in step 2 
(all buttons visible). Grab the set of buttons to the right of the chevron 
and drag it to the right until the chevron disappears and the build button 
is visible. Note that when you drag the buttons to the right, the *next* 
set of buttons to the right doesn't move, so the 2nd set of buttons now has 
a chevron.

The user shouldn't have to reposition every single set of buttons just to 
make one set bigger. When a set of buttons is dragged to the right, it 
should push along sets of buttons to it's right.
Agree it's not very friendly behavior, but it looks like it's platform behavior 
on Windows and was therefore emulated on Linux.  Not sure what could be done 
here.  Reassigning to SWT.
We will likely not do anything about this until after R2.0 ships.

The behavior is correct!
Dragging a CoolItem should not move the next CoolItem at its right until the 
CoolItem been dragged reach it's minimum width.

On Eclipse you can use the option "Reset ToolBar Layout" in this case.

I see it's not a friendly behavior, unfortunately there's nothing I can do.
"Dragging a CoolItem should not move the next CoolItem at its right until the
CoolItem been dragged reach it's minimum width."

This is true, but it's not what Eclipse does. You can keep dragging an item to 
the right past the minimum width such that you start collapsing buttons.
See comment above. The bug is that the coolbar doesn't behave as described.
I think you are confusing "preferred width" and "minimum width" for CoolItem.
Both values are set by the application, usually they are:

"preferred width" -- shows the whole ToolBar (without chevron).
"minimum width" -- shows only one ToolItem (*has the chevron*).

When dragging a CoolItem it only move another CoolItem when the minimum width 
is reached (after you get the items collapse).

Please, perform the same test on your Windows Eclipse, or even better, test it 
on IE. You will see that the emulated CoolBar is right.






The Windows toolbar (the main toolbar in Win98 and Win2K) behaves as I've 
requested for buttons. It only behaves like Eclipse for other toolbar items 
like the task list and the toolbars which contain text and buttons, such as 
the "Desktop" toolbar.

Emulating the behavior of Microsoft programs may be what we want to do on 
Windows (and I'd even argue against that), but it seems wrong for other 
platforms (Linux).</WithStack>

JavaCore.getClasspathContainer(path, jproject) should not throw an exception if

The scenario is the new java project wizard: The build path page wants to have

    <WithStack>As I need a feature of the 1.5 version of Ant, I tried to simply replace the 
ant.jar and ...optional.jar files in the ant plugin folder. It seems to work 
fine, except for a warning I get every time I execute a build script:

"Trying to override old definition of task copy"

This even happens with a build script as simple as

&lt;project default="all"&gt;
	&lt;target name="all"/&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
That happens because inside Eclipse we override the copy task so that when 
copying a file/folder, all its attributes (read-only, hidden, permission, 
etc...) are copied as well. It seems to work OK but we have not done any 
extensive tests. Since we copied and modified the copy task from Ant 1.4.1, if 
the task has changed between 1.4.1 and 1.5 we might miss new functionalities 
and/or bug fixes. It should be addressed after Eclipse 2.0 and Ant 1.5 are 
released. Suggest defer.
So are you saying that the copy task will work differently wether used inside 
or outside of eclipse? I don't think this is a good idea, as it could cause 
subtile problems when using a script in both ways. If I develop an Ant script 
inside of Eclipse, I would expect it to behave in exactly the same way when 
used "standalone" (as long as I don't use any of the eclipse tasks).
Yes, it will be different.
Deferring.
Investigate post 2.0 either removing or renaming our Copy task.
Reopening for possible removal of the Eclipse version of the copy task. Needs 
investigation.
Fixed and released.

(The preference page gets a combo were you can select the classpath entry

Fixed. Added #getDefaultJREContainerEntry.
Please verify.

There is a problem here, that may be somewhat unrelated:

- Uncheck use default boot path
- Add 
JRE to classpath
- Launch and notice command line doesn't show an empty -Xbootclasspath:
- Now 
add some other project to bootpath in config
- Launch and notice that now there is a -
Xbootclasspath: entry, but it shows
both the project and the JRE that was put on the 
classpath.

Note that if you uncheck use default bootpath, delete whatever entries are 
there, then launch, you do see the empty -Xbootclasspath: in the command line (event though launch 
fails because JRE lib can't be found).
This bug is fixed &amp; verified.  I annotated and re-opened the wrong bug.  Ignore previous comment.

    <WithStack>Global tasks are attached to the root resource, which is not visible. the only 
way to see these tasks are to filter by 'on any resource'. This is strange from 
a user perspective because you can explicitly exclude global tasks but never 
explicitly include them. This is an implementation side effect that global 
tasks (that the user sees as not on any resource in particular) are actually 
tacked on to this invisible root resource as the implementation has no place 
else to put them.
Is this still an issue in 3.2?
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

Got the following error message when running eclipse in eclipse:
Error parsing version "null" for plugin: org.eclipse.platform in 
Workbench.readFeaturesInfo()

Here are the steps:
- got the new drop, started with a fresh workspace
- caught up to swt projects, set .classpath
- imported 'org.eclipse.ui' and all of it's prereqs as source from external 
plugins
- set up a launch config to run eclipse in eclipse using the following plugins 
from my workspace (and all other plugins from external):
   org.eclipse.swt
   org.eclipse.swt.examples
   org.eclipse.swt.win32
   org.eclipse.ui
- launched eclipse in eclipse

Console contained the error message, and the runtime workspace .log contains:

The new incremental build behaviour without a progress dialog is very dangerous! 
I was able to get deadlock on my first attempt &lt;g&gt;

1) Open two workbench windows
2) Start an incremental build in one window
3) Switch to the other window
4) Select a project, and choose rebuild project

-&gt;Deadlock

I will attach the javacore file.
Created attachment 1140
Javacore log showing locked threads
We are aware of the problem and will be submitting a fix today to disable all 
other shells.

Deleting (or closing) org.eclipse.swt.win32 doesn't update org.eclipse.swt. It 
still shows the package fragment root /ws/win32/swt.jar.
This is a delta problem. The removal of the package fragment root is not 
reported.
Fixed by looking at all package fragment roots and generating the corresponding 
deltas when a project is added/removed.
Verified, both closing/opening is behaving ok.</WithStack>

I got in a state where pressing Tab in the Java text editor caused the focus to
move from the editor to the global toolbar. At this point it was impossible for
me to insert a tab into the editor. Closing the editor and re-opening fixed the
problem.

I do *not* have the "insert spaces instead of tabs" option on.

I could not replicate.
I've since upgraded to 20020531. This has happened four times, it's a really
serious detriment to writing code.

    <WithStack>It would be nice to have a explorer/netscape progress bar at the bottom of the
site explorer which would allow cancellation. Also it could allow updating the
view in a non-blocking thread. I've already added some support to the target ui
model elements for this but there is more work to be done in creating the
progress parts and testing.

This would also allow cancellation of long running operations. However, with a
reasonable timeout value progress is, in my view, an enhancement. As long as
operations timeout reasonably. This is the behavior of most browsers, for
example the file explorer on windows.

Got the following walkbacks while attempting to move *.java files.
Scenario:
- Imported from a *.jar file.  
- Selected an incorrect destination such that a bogus package was created 
(e.g., org.eclipse.ui.internal.org.eclipse.ui.internal)
- Selected the files from the bogus package and moved them to their correct 
place.
- The files were not moved.

Acutally, move in general appears to be broken.  I thought it was related to 
import, but I just got the problem attempting to move a class from one package 
to another (org.eclipse.ui to org.eclipse.ui.part).



*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 18418 ***</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Build 20020530.
Got the following walkbacks while attempting to move *.java files.
Scenario:
- Imported from a *.jar file.  
- Selected an incorrect destination such that a bogus package was created 
(e.g., org.eclipse.ui.internal.org.eclipse.ui.internal)
- Selected the files from the bogus package and moved them to their correct 
place.
- The files were not moved.

    <WithStack>The task view should be split into a task view and a problems view. Currently 
these are merged which raises a number of issues. Delete is confusing as 
problems are read only. Filtering and presentation is confusing as problems 
don't have priorities and tasks don't have severities. Users interested in 
navigating build problems that otherwise don't make any use of the task 
functionality could do without seeing the new task button always at the 
forefront of the ui, or other task specific functionality in the context menus, 
and visa versa for users that like to log tasks to themselves but otherwise use 
other methods for navigating errors. the filter dialog is unnecessarily complex 
because of this forced merging as well.

    <WithStack>with navigator and package view both open, select no items on navigator (ctrl 
click the current selection off if necessary), activate package view and select 
some items. adjust task filter to filter by one of the selection options. now 
activate navigator view. notice no change.
this is due to the fact task view has intentionally introduced a bug: i.e. to 
only change the selection when the active part is an editor, or a view 
providing a structured selection of one or more resources. the motivation for 
this i believe is to force a lazy behavior so the task view doesn't flicker too 
much when activating views that don't contribute to the task view. the design 
problem is that the task view is proactively attaches itself to the selections 
of the active view without any knowledge if that view can provide a meaningful 
selection. outline view, for instance, returns a selection of 0 items even when 
there is no outline available, where other views return null for their 
selection. without a formal contract between the task view and the active view 
for the active view to supply resources, the task view needs to be able to 
intelligently determine whether or not a selection is providing resources. it 
cannot do this with a null or empty selection.

    <WithStack>if you invoke 'hide editors' when an editor part is active, the editors hide, 
but no view is activated. i haven't debugged this, but i am guessing that the 
editor part did not deactivate or close. if you activate a view, then close it, 
notice no active view once again. continuing with my assumption, the hidden 
editor part is probably being activated as it is first in the mru order. this 
is odd behavior for a user.
Should be dealt with editors+perspectives work.

Why is this a debug bug? Shouldn't it be SWT?
Because it was a core dump running from the Run dialog - I wasn't sure who it 
should go to.
Moving to SWT.
I can't duplicate this on F2.  Can you try again and see if it still happens 
for you?  I'm using RH7.3 w/ kde 3.

Still get the same problem in F2
The lesstif libraries are being picked up by the launching of the snippet.  
Since the home directory is now reset from the eclipse root to some other 
directory it's now possible for lesstif libraries to be accessed in such cases 
if they appear on the library path first.

This is the same problem as bug 4730 but in a different scenario.

Why is this a debug bug? Shouldn't it be SWT?
Because it was a core dump running from the Run dialog - I wasn't sure who it 
should go to.
Moving to SWT.
I can't duplicate this on F2.  Can you try again and see if it still happens 
for you?  I'm using RH7.3 w/ kde 3.

Still get the same problem in F2
The lesstif libraries are being picked up by the launching of the snippet.  
Since the home directory is now reset from the eclipse root to some other 
directory it's now possible for lesstif libraries to be accessed in such cases 
if they appear on the library path first.

This is the same problem as bug 4730 but in a different scenario.

there are two URLDecoders in the WebDAV project.
I suggest we remove the package org.eclipse.webdav.internal.utils and move the 
classes to org.eclipse.webdav.internal.kernel.utils
Deferring until post 2.0
This is no longer the case in 3.2.
Closing.

The Filters... item on the view menu has a radio bullet, even though there are 
no other items in this group to choose from.
it is used to indicate that there is an active filter. Otherwise there is no 
indication whether there is a filter active.
Usually a radio bullet indicates a 1 of N choice.
To indicate whether something is active or not, recommend using a checkbox.
However, usually a checkbox item simply toggles state, and does bring up extra 
UI.
Could have two items:
- Enable Filters (check with simple toggle behaviour)
- Configure Filters (no check, enabled only when Enable Filters is checked)

I think having two items will confuse the user. I opt to use a check box 
instead of a "radio" button.
Agree with Dirk. Changed RADIO to CHECK

Which view? The views have to hook it as a key listener.
We can't use an accelerator because it conflicts with step into in Debug.
Sorry, thought it was global.

F5 didn't seem to work in Navigator.
It's working for me in the Navigator in the Resource perspective.
Were you in a Debug perspective, or did you have Step Into (F5) in the Run menu?

Can we close this?

    <WithOutStack>Its no longer hooked and its not in the label for the pulldown File-&gt;Refresh.
Which view? The views have to hook it as a key listener.
We can't use an accelerator because it conflicts with step into in Debug.
Sorry, thought it was global.

F5 didn't seem to work in Navigator.
It's working for me in the Navigator in the Resource perspective.
Were you in a Debug perspective, or did you have Step Into (F5) in the Run menu?

Can we close this?

&gt;I cannot see the diferences between the Members view and the Outline view

Major differences:
- the Members view can work without an editor
- the Members view can show the content of any select CU or type

I agree with your request.

Post 2.1

This is not that easy to fix because selection changed event is not sent upon
cursor movements i.e. when the offset changes while the length is 0 (reason is
performance: all selection listeners would be triggered while typing in an editor).

TextViewer now sends a (delayed) selection changed event upon caret position
changes.

Adapted browsing views to this.

Available in builds &gt; N20030602

FYI: The text infrastructure now sends post selection events. Due bug 39511 the
fix for this bug is currently broken.</WithStack>

Due to implementation issues of ProgramRunner, if an Ant builder is run right 
after a program (.exe or .bat) builder, the output of the Ant builder sometimes 
shows on the log console before the output of the program builder. They ARE 
executed in the right order however.
When we switch to using the debug console, it will split up the log properly to 
show only the selected external tool running in the process view.

Note: new external tool work is not yet released to the head stream and won't 
for a while yet.
This bug has not been fixed and should not have been closed.
Program output and Ant output is now in seperate consoles (i.e. seperate 
documents in the same view), when using new launch config support.

    <WithStack>Environment:
  On build 515, in Simplified Chinese, running NL fragments built on 5-30.

Description:
  Corrupt quotation characters in first page of new plugin project wizard.  
Corruption appears as a skinny, solid, tall rectangle in the banner section 
around com.example.xyz.

To replicate:
1) File&gt;New&gt;Plugin Project
2) on first page, in banner, corrupt quotes wrap around com.example.xyz
One more thing: we have tried a multitude of fonts to alleviate this problem 
and it doesn't appear to be sensitive to font changes in XP.  On Win2k font 
changes actually have an effect.
Cannot replicate in build F2 on a Chinese XP machine with GB18030 installed.

The fonts used by the banner on wizards is the same as the Banner Font and 
Header Font preferences of the Workbench preferences - changing an OS setting 
will not make any difference. Your current settings with be Tahoma as we 
currently only supply English fonts.

As there is no NL version of this fonts file currently available the way to 
see if this is actually a problem is to select Preferences-Fonts-Banner Font 
and Header Font and change this to values that are valid on your machine (e.g. 
to one of the GB18030 fonts) and try again.

Reassigning to Platform-UI and myself as this is a Platform-UI not PDE issue.

I originally had tried modifying those settings within the workbench.  Only 
when they had no effect did I attempt working through display properties for 
Windows.  I haven't had the opportunity to try on anything later than 515, with 
NL fragments, as we are currently awaiting translations based off of F1.  Will 
update when I can test with a more recent build.
Testing with the F# build and the 20020610 fragments on a Chinese XP machine 
with GB18030 support I do not get this.

My Header font  is ËÎÌå regular 10 - which one did you get on the machine with 
the problem?
Problem was reported in build 515 + fragment. When testing again with build F2 + 
fragment, problem disappeared.
Marking as fixed after verification by Cam-Thu Le.

When IE 6 is installed on Windows 98 it replaces the task bar with one of its 
own (according to Dave Thomson). When this occurs the focus behaviour of shells 
with modality set to SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL  changes.

STEPS
1) Start Windows 98 on a machine with IE 5 or earlier
2) Select a file
3) Hit delete - a prompter comes up
4) Select an non Eclipse window and drag it over the dialog
5) Select the Eclipse parent window in the tasks list - the dialog and window 
are given focus
6) Start Windows 98 on a machine with IE 62) Select a file
3) Hit delete - a prompter comes up
4) Select an non Eclipse window and drag it over the dialog
5) Select the Eclipse parent window in the tasks list - the dialog only is 
given focus and the window stays in the backgroud.

I don't have a good pure SWT example of this yet as I am still trying to find 
the condition that makes this happen.
Is the dialog a child of the shell? If it isn't there's no reason for the shell to 
come to the front when the dialog does. 

In any case, this seems like a minor issue to me. Do you believe this 
needs to be addressed for R2.0?
The dialog shell is the child of the window shell.

I do not believe this is a major issue for 2.0 as the user loses no 
information - i.e. the modal shell is the one they see so there are no mystery 
dialog preventing them working. 
Basically, I believe you are seeing something which would be true for 
every windows app: Installing the new IE changes the behavior. As long 
as this isn't causing anyone any real grief, I'm not even going to look at it 
until after R2.0.

This is not an issue for 2.0.  However I believe it does expose a bug in our 
code.  Not ALL of our dialogs exhibit this behavior - in fact most of them work 
correctly.  Other applications also work correctly and are not affected by IE 6.

Only certain of our dialogs (such as the one in the test case) work 
incorrectly, so it could indicate a problem with the way the particular dialog 
is create or its relationship to the underlying shell.

The reason I asked the question "Is the dialog a child of the parent?" is 
because I have had cases in the past where we tried to debug one of 
these but eventually proved that the dialog's parent was null (even though 
we were told by the UI team that it was not). If this is true, then the new "IE 
6" specific behavior is the correct behavior. This would certainly explain 
the fact that some dialogs exhibit the behavior and some do not.

Another possibility would be that the dialogs that work are the built in 
dialogs, and all "hand rolled" dialogs are broken, in which case the 
problem would definately be in our code.

In any case, as previously stated. This bug is LATER.

Confirmed that we are setting the parent shell properly.
I saw the problem with the Navigator on my home machine (XP), but not at work 
(also XP).  Both have IE 6.

Moving from Later.
Tod, can you try this again with the "32770" changes?
Works with the 32270 changes in build 20020911. Closing.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In Eclipse 1.0, Core runtime's "$nl$" mechanism was implemented
incorrectly.  A path like "$nl$/foo.txt" would end up looking in
the following locale-specific locations under the plug-in (including
fragments), assuming the current locale is "fr_FR_EURO":
    nl/fr_FR_EURO/foo.txt
    nl/fr_FR/foo.txt
    nl/fr/foo.txt
    foo.text
This is incorrect. It should have been looking in this sequence
of locations:
    nl/fr/FR/EURO/foo.txt
    nl/fr/FR/foo.txt
    nl/fr/foo.txt
    foo.text

This problem has been corrected For Eclipse 2.0

However, for backwards compatibility, the old 1.0 way should be supported
as well (considered as deprecated). The implementation should look in this 
order:
    nl/fr/FR/EURO/foo.txt
    nl/fr_FR_EURO/foo.txt
    nl/fr/FR/foo.txt
    nl/fr_FR/foo.txt

2. Create B.java in package q:

3. Move B.java to p.
Observe: The resulting content of B.java has an extra blank line:
package p;

public class B extends A {

Moving B.java back and forth between p and q keeps adding blank lines.
The issue is how to handle end of line comments after imports. I'd assume they 
are rare and I'd opt for deleting the entire line. The comment belongs to the 
import statement anyways.
ImportStructure problem
i ask it to remove the import and it does not think deleting 
the line is a good idea, for some reason

for reference: move B.java to p (*no reference update*)
and invoke 'organize imports' - you're left with exactly the same empty line

Create a new plugin project using wizard.
Select Plugin with a view template.
Accept all defaults.
Finish
Instructions to run are incorrect (***see attached bitmap).  The instructions 
reference a Debug menu which does not exist, and if you click the run link, you 
are left in a dialog that has a grayed out Run button so it is not possible to 
run the plugin (unless of course you know the secret - that you have to make a 
new configuration - but this is too obscure for a beginning user).

I suggest something like the following:
Change the instructions to tell people they can run or debug the plugin by 
using Run-&gt;Run As-&gt;Runtime Workbench or Run-&gt;Debug As-&gt;Runtime Workbench 
respectively.  This allows them to easily run it while bypassing the confusing 
Run... dialog which is a more advanced feature.  Either remove the run link 
altogether, or explain that if they click on this they will be able to set 
advanced parameters.

Create a new plugin project using wizard.

Finish
Run-&gt;Run...
You are presented with a confusing dialog with a grayed out run button.
Close the dialog.
Run it using Run-&gt;Run As-&gt;Runtime workbench
After it opens, close it.
Now try it the first way again.
Run-&gt;Run...
This time, Run is not grayed, and you can just press it and it works.
Question: Should it not appear this way the first time so a new user can just 
accept the defaults and press Run?
When using the shortcut, a new launch config instance is created and 
initialized with defaults. When you use Run-&gt;Run... again, this new instance is 
now shown in the tree and selected. Selecting the instance causes the 'Run' 
button to enable (and the tabs to show the config parameters). The first time 
you select 'Run-&gt;Run...' the dialog does not know what launch type are after. 
However, shortcuts registered for 'Run-&gt;Run As' know what to do.

I am moving this to Debug because they control the dialog behaviour.
When the launch dialog is opened, it selects the configuration that was last 
launched. In the use case above, the first time the dialog is opened, there are 
no configurations to select from. 

Poposal:
(1) Debug UI adds new API to set the configuration to be launched when the 
debug button is pressed (this is the same as what gets selected when the dialog 
is opened).
(2) PDE creates launch config when a new plugin project is created, and uses 
the new API to set the config to launch

This solution is even better in that the user can just press "run" or "debug" 
without having to see the dialog.
Adding Dejan as CC
There has been some disagreement on an API that can interfere with the launch 
history. If there are launches in the workbench, then clients should not be 
able to change the launch history/expected behavior of the run/debug buttons.

Proposal is on hold. No changes planned at this point. The suggested action to 
to use "Run/Debug As -&gt; Runtime Workbench".

No changes planned for 2.0.
Closing.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

the new API to set the config to launch

This solution is even better in that the user can just press "run" or "debug" 
without having to see the dialog.
Adding Dejan as CC
There has been some disagreement on an API that can interfere with the launch 
history. If there are launches in the workbench, then clients should not be 
able to change the launch history/expected behavior of the run/debug buttons.

Proposal is on hold. No changes planned at this point. The suggested action to 
to use "Run/Debug As -&gt; Runtime Workbench".

No changes planned for 2.0.
Closing.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

What is special about the JUnit launch config is that the tab group
initializes the default run perspective to "null", i.e. no change.

However, when doing the compare only values supplied by the tabs
are taken into consideration. See 
LaunchConfigurationDialog.updateWorkingCopyFromPages(); 
The defaults set by the tabgroup itself are not considered. Hence there is a 
difference. The launch configs compared are (without the qualifcation)

As you can see the run perspective is missing in one config.
should use IDebugUIConstants.PERSPECTIVE_NONE rather than "null" to indicate no 
perspective switching.
problem was that perspective attribute was set to the "" string and not to
IDebugUIConstants.PERSPECTIVE_NONE.

The PDE RuntimeWorkbenchShortCut has the same problem.

Use an ant script which defines multiple tasks - but no one called "main".
Select the script in the navigator, right click, select 'run ant'
Select one task - the console thinks it is task (2), not (1)
Run it. It fails. The log console displays:

It is not a big issue, I just have to add these 2 lines to workaround it.
&lt;target name="main"&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;

Is it required to always define a main task? If so, we might display a warning 
in the Run Ant dialog displaying the tasks.
No, it is not required but what default target value do you have in your 
project declaration? If it is "main" and you do not have a "main" target, then 
that is the problem.
Sorry - my PR is bogus. I had forgotten the meaning of that attribute. It was 
set to "main", changing it fixes the problem.

    <WithStack>When location arguments contain spaces, some tools don't work properly.

For example, create a project in your workspace named "Test Project" (the space

Select the file abc.txt, then run the tool. Write will try to find the file

This is pretty important.  I think the different Runtime.exec methods handle

Might have to quote args with spaces ourselves.

The plugin import wizard prompts the user with the following question when two 
versions of org.apache.xerces exist in the plugins directory.

Project "org.apache.xerces" already exists.  Is it OK to replace it?

If you click Yes and let the import finish, you get only one version of xerces.

Perhaps the plugin import tool should make project names like 
org.apache.xerces_4.0.3 for the plugins.

As a test, unzip the attached zip (3.2.1 version of xerces) into your plugins 
directory, and run the plugin import wizard.

Xerces_3.2.1.zip
*** Bug 18522 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Will not be addressed in 2.1
This problem will become more prominent when we start shipping multiple versions of the same plug-in in the SDK, e.g. org.junit (not yet for 3.3). I also ran into this problem with plug-ins that I updated via update manager (which leaves the old version around).
This is a good one to reopen.
This one is certainly doable now that we support multiple versions of the same plug-in.

We could do the WinZip behavior: offer to overwrite or create a project by a different name and let the user input the new name.
post 3.3, right?  

Note: we already have this as a documented limitation in the readme.
yes, post-3.3.  Now is not time to address a bug numbered "18500" ;)

we should get this one done for 3.4
By now there are 5 options in override dialog. We can change meaning of the No and No for all, to show change name dialog for the plugins but it may confuse users. Adding two more ... well this will be way to much for such a simple task.

And I've newer work on so old bug :) If you don't have a better candidate I can solve it :D
The solution I think is really simple and deals with creating projects for plugins in a special way if they have multiples... ie., org.apache.commons.collections_3.1.0, org.apache.commons.collections_3.2.0, versus just org.apache.commons.collections...

ie., id_version

I'll have to look into this a bit more but I think that should be sufficient.

I'll look at this soon, thanks for looking into it Bartek.
Thanks for the patch Bartosz.  You just fixed the oldest PDE bug on record!

I added just a little bit of logic to look for an existing plug-in in the workspace with the same id and version.  If such a plug-in project exists, we then return that name instead of the &lt;id&gt;_&lt;version&gt; so we prevent having two plug-ins with the same id and version.

It might have taken 5 and a half years, but some things are worth the wait ;-)  

Thanks Bartosz!
it was a great "adventure" for me to ;) especially the patch was the oldest one I ever had :D


anyway I am working for top contributor for this year ;D
Just for the record, this modification required changes to our JUnit tests.  The tests verify the plug-in was imported correctly by checking to see if a project exists with the plug-in id.  I changed up the test cases to check to &lt;id&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.  I didn't think about this until all the import test cases were broke :)
&gt;very simple patch
Unfortunately a bit too simple, see bug 217820 and bug 217824. This causes big trouble.

I suggest to reopen and revert for M5 and make a better fix for M6.
Before adding this PDE has to test and if needed update all its tooling like the launcher, hyperlinking to go to required plug-ins, pde container etc.
(In reply to comment #22)
&gt; &gt;very simple patch
&gt; Unfortunately a bit too simple,
yes :| anyway besides of checking the tooling we should think about the import logic (should we leave override behaviour as default ? ) and how to support handling different versions. 

My idea is to add checkbox like "Allow multiversions" (but it will complicate the ui) which is disabled by default.

Let's assume we have plug-in A in two versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

When option is enabled in and we import both plug-ins there will be create two project A (v1.0.1) and A_1.0.0

but there is a question what to do when we have A(v1.0.0) in workspace and import again both:
should we add A_1.0.1 or update A to 1.0.1 and add new project 1.0.0 ?

alternatively we can consider changes in override dialog but I don't think this is good idea


&gt;My idea is to add checkbox like "Allow multiversions" 
Better: 'Append version to project name'. Out of the box it should import as before.

But as long as PDE doesn't support it it shouldn't be offered. For example hyperlinking: if I import A and B from two versions (e.g. 3.2 and 3.3) and B requires A then clicking a required plug-in in B's manifest always goes to the same version of A instead of the correct one. Also, in some scenarios both B's can  fit the version constaints and hence PDE would have to show a selection dialog to which B I want to go. And of course there's the launching issue.
pulled out the change, Brian and I are discussing what to do about this in M6. We have a possible solution.
Thanks!
is there anything I can participate in ?
(In reply to comment #26)
&gt; pulled out the change, Brian and I are discussing what to do about this in M6.
&gt; We have a possible solution.
&gt; 

Pinging zx, sometime we should discuss what could be done here.
This could become more of an issue when we ship version 3 and 4 of org.junit.
I don't think we need another option: it is already possible to select two versions of the same bundle if 'Show latest version of plug-ins only' is unchecked and if I do so, the last one wins (overwrites the first one).

The following small change to the initially proposed solution might do the trick:

When importing plug-in 'P' check if that bundle is already in the workspace with the same version (without qualifier)
- if yes import with same name as in workspace (overwrite existing)
- if no import as "P (x.y.z)"
Darin and I came up with an alternate proposal:

1) Remove the current yes/yes to all/no/no to all/cancel prompting.
2) Before starting to import individual bundles, scan the workspace models for bundles with the same symbolic name as a bundle being imported.
3) If there are any bundle name conflicts, open a dialog with a checkbox table.  List all bundles with the same name along with their version and project name.
4) The user can deselect bundles they do not want overwritten (a single import could overwrite multiple projects).
5) Delete the selected projects.
6) Import the plug-ins, if there is still a project with the same default name, append the version (without qualifier).  If that project exists, make the project name be "&lt;symbolic name&gt; (&lt;version&gt;) #" with increasing values of #.

This solution makes the import depend on bundle names rather than project names, which feels more natural as project can be called anything.  The user also has a fair amount of control over what they delete.
Ankur, if we go forward with the proposal in comment #32 would you have time to work on this?

Though I'm considering finding time to work on it, because it is &lt; 20,000 and over 7 years old!

If Dani is also OK with the proposal, I'll target it for M4.
&gt;4) The user can deselect bundles they do not want overwritten (a single import
&gt;could overwrite multiple projects).
I always import &gt; 100 bundles. You don't expect me to check each of them manually, do you? ;-) Currently I have to click exactly once. This must stay as is as this the common workflow when importing the binary bundles from a new drop.


The suggestion from comment 32 only unnecessarily complicates things. My suggestion would not cause any disruption to the known (and (90%) workflow but would only come into play in case there are &gt;1 version of the same bundle implemented.

If I can choose, then better do nothing than what's proposed in comment 32.
The dialog I am proposing would have checkbox selection, (de)select all buttons, and would have everything selected by default.  For your case Dani, the only difference would be you pressing OK instead of Yes to All.

The dialog would be an improvement on the current system, where you get a dialog with 5 buttons and if you want to avoid overwriting one or more projects you have to go through a series of dialogs until you happen to get the one for the project you care about.  This has become more annoying on linux as the Yes button, selected by default, shows up on the far right making the buton order look jumbled.

The current system also only works on project name, so to support your proposal we would have to do the same kind of changes that I'm proposing.  I'm also concerned that as bundles increase their versions you'll end up with multiple projects for the same singleton bundle.
Comment 32 sounds great! Just 1 caveat and 1 change request:

In steps 5 &amp; 6, the implementation should make sure that plug-ins which replace existing plug-ins stay in the same working set as the original plug-ins (steps in bug 256592).

I don't like spaces in project names. Could the projects be named as proposed in comment 0, e.g. like this (stuff in [] only to disambiguate):

&lt;symbolic name&gt;[_&lt;version without qualifier&gt;[_&lt;unique number&gt;]]
&gt;The dialog I am proposing would have checkbox selection, (de)select all
&gt;buttons, and would have everything selected by default.  For your case Dani,
&gt;the only difference would be you pressing OK instead of Yes to All.
If it has '(De-)Select All' and the default is that all are checked then that looks good to me. Given the SDK already has around 200 bundles we should also use a filtered checkbox list.

We want to proceed with bug 153429 so I hoped to quickly get a working importer again with what I suggested in comment 31 but if you have resources to provide a new UI then that's also OK, but I don't want to wait too long for that ;-)


&gt;I don't like spaces in project names. Could the projects be named as proposed
&gt;in comment 0, e.g. like this (stuff in [] only to disambiguate):
And I don't like underscores in the name ;-) but I agree that unless there are ambiguities we only want the symbolic name like I proposed in my solution. In case of dis-ambiguities we should simply use the same rendering as PDE uses in the import and target pref page:

Here's a quick list of things to fix, I can probably work on some of them if it means getting this in for M4.

1) The dialog opens even when there are no conflicts
2) The check box should be part of the plug-in name column (see Installed JREs pref page)
3) There should be an icon on the first column (you can use the general PDE label provider just like the plugin import detailed page does)
4) The first column should be "Name" or "Plug-in" not symbolic name
5) The first column is too small, you can probably have the columns take equal sizes
6) Select all and deselect all buttons should be underneath, not beside the table.  (see the dialog that offers to save multiple dirty editors when closing Eclipse).
7) When people see columns with headers, they generally expect to be able to click on them to sort by that column.
8) All entries in the dialog should be checked by default
9) Filter box should search anywhere in the name (see the plugin import detail page)

The filtering/select all behaviour could be an issue.  The buttons don't change enablement when everything/nothing is selected.  The select all only affects what is visible.  I'm not sure if this is actually a problem as it is useful to only change what is visible and other selection dialogs don't worry about disabling select all.

We could try moving away from columns which would avoid some of the above issues.  That just might make it hard to see the project name.
I think we also need to look at how this dialog handles some unusual cases.  Specifically I am concerned that we need to do more of the project clean-up ahead of time rather than just setting overwriteProject to true when importing each plug-in.

If we are importing org.eclipse.foo v1.0 and two other copies of org.eclipse.foo exist in the workspace, should we delete both of the existing projects?  Darin and I had discussed this a bit when we first talked about having the new dialog, but I don't remember what the conclusion was.

Patch

Curtis, let me know your comments.
Fixed up the dialog (altered label provider, composite sizing, message text) and fixed a few bugs in the code (possible NPEs, incorrect project naming).  Committed the code to HEAD.

There is a change in behaviour with this fix.  When the user imports a plug-in with a conflict and chooses not to delete the project, previously we would skip importing that plug-in.  After this fix, instead of ignoring, we import the plug-in and give it a different name.

The plugin import wizard prompts the user with the following question when two 
versions of org.apache.xerces exist in the plugins directory.

Project "org.apache.xerces" already exists.  Is it OK to replace it?

If you click Yes and let the import finish, you get only one version of xerces.

Perhaps the plugin import tool should make project names like 
org.apache.xerces_4.0.3 for the plugins.

As a test, unzip the attached zip (3.2.1 version of xerces) into your plugins 
directory, and run the plugin import wizard.

*** Bug 18522 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Will not be addressed in 2.1
This problem will become more prominent when we start shipping multiple versions of the same plug-in in the SDK, e.g. org.junit (not yet for 3.3). I also ran into this problem with plug-ins that I updated via update manager (which leaves the old version around).
This is a good one to reopen.
This one is certainly doable now that we support multiple versions of the same plug-in.

We could do the WinZip behavior: offer to overwrite or create a project by a different name and let the user input the new name.
post 3.3, right?  

Note: we already have this as a documented limitation in the readme.
yes, post-3.3.  Now is not time to address a bug numbered "18500" ;)

&gt;Here's a quick list of things to fix, I can probably work on some of them if it
&gt;means getting this in for M4.
We need a way in M4 to import two versions of the same bundle.

Curtis, let me know your comments.
Fixed up the dialog (altered label provider, composite sizing, message text) and fixed a few bugs in the code (possible NPEs, incorrect project naming).  Committed the code to HEAD.

There is a change in behaviour with this fix.  When the user imports a plug-in with a conflict and chooses not to delete the project, previously we would skip importing that plug-in.  After this fix, instead of ignoring, we import the plug-in and give it a different name.
