I changed our tests to use NamingConvention.
There are failuers, please check.

NameProposerTest in jdt.ui.tests
Martin - can you confirm that the problem is actually in the NamingConvention, 
and not in the test itself?
yes, it's showing the difference between our old NameProposer and the new 
NamingConvention.

- prefixed ending with a letter (e.g. f) should only be removed if the 
following caracter of the name if a capital letter (e.g. fCount -&gt; count
foo -&gt; foo) (m_color -&gt; color)

- if a field begins with is, special handling for getter/setter
isBlue -&gt; isBlue -&gt; setBlue &amp;&amp; isBlue

There are bug reports for this (rules for bean attributes)
What is the rule if 'isBlue' is not a boolean ?
for non- boolean, get/set must be used. For boolean it can be is/set but also 
get/set is fine. Important is that when cut the get/set or is/set, the rest is 
the same.


class X {
  int isBlue;
  int setGreen;
  boolean getRed;
}

Suggested getter and setter should be:
getBlue/setBlue or getIsBlue/setIsBlue ?
getGreen/setGreen or getSetGreen/setSetGreen ?
isRed/setRed or isGetRed/setGetRed ?

What part of the field name must be remove to compute getter/setter name ?
i would say it is
getIsBlue/setIsBlue
getSetGreen/setSetGreen
isGetRed/setGetRed

the only exception is for boolean isXX, because using 'is' for a boolean seems 
to be a common pattern and isIsXX is really ugly.
to use isXX or setXX for e.g. an int is of course possible too, but doesn't 
make too much sense to me.

API Change in org.eclipse.jdt.core.NamingConventions: a new boolean 
parameter 'isBoolean' added. The value of this parameter is true if the field's 
type is boolean.
  suggestSetterName(IJavaProject,char[],int,char[][])
  become
  suggestSetterName(IJavaProject,char[],int,boolean,char[][])

  suggestSetterName(IJavaProject,String,int,String[])
  become
  suggestSetterName(IJavaProject,String,int,boolean,String

Fixed.

*** Bug 23960 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I do not understand why you created a new bug for this, and closed the older one as a duplicate. The older one had a number of people -- including myself -- on the CC list for this bug.

Later bugs are normally closed as the duplicate, and not the earlier ones.
I made a mistake.
*** Bug 35071 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
NOTE:  Drag &amp; Drop is unrelated to the ability to drag views around in 
Eclipse.  This has been implemented for 2.1.1 and 3.0.

Drag &amp; Drop refers to classes in the package org.eclipse.swt.dnd and deals 
with dragging and dropping data between SWT and native apps, being a drop 
target or drag source none of which Eclipse is doing when you drag around a 
view in the IDE.
Dragging Views around in eclipse is addressed by bug 28525 which has been 
fixed in 2.1.1 and 3.0.
I would like to mention that it would already be very helpful if the DropTarget just generated the 
events (as the DragSource does).
Veronika, didn't you implement this?  If so, please close this PR.
The DropTarget already generates events.  They are not the same events as the 
DragSource - they are the events relevant to a dorp target.

See:
http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-SWT-DND/DND-in-SWT.html

Most of DND has been implemented on the Mac (and ported back to 2.1.1).

The things that are still missing are:
- enable DND between applications, currently disabled until interaction with 
Finder can be made safe
- enable drag under effects for Table and Tree
It has been 6 months since the last update of this request.  Are we still 
waiting on "interaction with Finder can be made safe"?

I would really like to have the ability to drop to finder if at all possible.
Eric, feel free to pitch in, browse the code and submit a patch.
Ok...I enabled drag capabilities in the swt library and everything seems to 
work great.  What interaction with the finder needs to be made safe?
Andre, Veronika is gone right now.  Do you know of the interaction that he's 
talking about?
I mean "she's" of course ...
A note on drag behavior to the finder...

on Panther 10.3.3 it seems that the Operating System needs to have TextTransfer 
supported for ANY drag to the finder.  You just have to support the type and 
return a valid string when requested. (If you are transferring files it still 
needs this)

on 10.2.8 this is not required and actually always chooses text transfer if you 
support it.  This is a problem since you might be wanting to actually transfer 
another type, like a file.

I special cased 10.3 and above to include the text transfer and every other OS 
and Mac version just include the Transfer type I want to transfer (files in my 
case). Not sure this will work in all cases but at least it provides some 
functionality for my users.

So, I hope this helps someone.  Not sure if this is an Operating System bug or 
not but what a pain!
Andre?
I haven't looked into Drag&amp;Drop to Finder under Panther yet.
So, I do not have any more information about this.
But I'll do a quick check...
Eric, do you have any code (or patch) that I can try?
Created attachment 8993
Test case for Drag to Finder

This simple text case shows the variance in behavior between OS X 10.3.3 and
10.2.8.  You need to modify the sample code to point to some local file for
dragging.

You will also need to enable the drag feature in the SWT library.  
Source File: org.eclipse.swt.dnd.DragSource.java 
Method signature: private void drag(Event);
Eric, thanks for the snippet.
I enabled external drags in SWT and used it both with your snippet and with Eclipse.
Here is my conclusion:
- dragging items from Eclipse to other applications (with the exception of the Finder) seems
   to work well on Panther (our only supported Platform for 3.0).
- as already found by Eric, dragging items to the Finder works only if the DragSource
   contains a TextTransfer (in addition to a FileTransfer).
- I don't know what problems comment #9 is referring to ("disabled until interaction
   with Finder can be made safe"), however I couldn't find any problems.

From these findings I suggest to start enabling the drag feature in the SWT library.
The added functionality is useful and I see no risk involved even if interaction with the Finder does not 
work.

But I'm not so sure in how to deal with the additional TextTransfer required for FileTransfer drags to
the Finder. I don't think that application should know about this MacOS implementation detail.
A consequence would be that a FileTransfer includes TextTransfer too. But I don't know whether this is
possible or desirable. 

Let's enable it then.  Veronika can check our work when she gets back.
What's the state of DND support in Mac for SWT &gt;= 3.0.52? Is it already 
possible to drag and drop items inside a SWT application from Tree to Tree and 
CTabItem to Tree?

From text perspective stack trace looks OK. The UI thread involves SWT only it 
seems. Moving to SWT.
Are you really running 2.1 or is this 3.0?
Not sure what to do about this.  Since there is no lock around the OS on 
Windows, the SendMessage() should run right away so it isn't deadlock.  The 
only thing I can think of is that there is an infinite loop in Windows under 
certain conditions.

Sonia, how do you want to procede?
*** Bug 30106 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
adding Kevin H. to the discussion.
More info from Kevin:

The contents of the man pages should reflect any on-line help that would
be generated (e.g., eclipse -help). See bug # 25334.

The motif man file (man/man1/eclipse-motif.1) is really misnamed. It
should be: man/man1/eclipse.1.

The actual man page contents are probably out of date. I am not sure
whether the switches listed are still valid or whether they should even be
documented. This is related to the on-line help mentioned above. Again, the
contents should indicate ECLIPSE(1) and not ECLIPSE-MOTIF(1).

The -showsplash and -endsplash (which doesn't exist) switches should not
be documented since they are private switches between the launcher and the
Eclipse core.

If these man pages are to be shipped, then the main "eclipse" directory
(where the launcher resides when installed) will need a "man/man1" directory
(e.g. &lt;installDir&gt;/eclipse/man/man1) where the man page file will reside.
The user will then have to add the top man directory to the existing MANPATH
as follows:

/bin/sh:   MANPATH=${MANPATH}:&lt;installDir&gt;/eclipse/man; export MANPATH
/bin/csh:  setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:&lt;installDir&gt;/eclipse/man

With a real product install, such as WebSphere Workbench, the install
mechanism could put this man directory into a better location on disk. With
Eclipse being shipped as a ZIP file, this is harder to do.

To add the man pages does not require a change to the launcher.  This is really 
a build/install issue.

Moving to releng to consider.
Can we revive this bug report?  It would be really nice to ship some man pages
with eclipse.  Some Linux distributions (Red Hat and Debian, at least) are
currently creating their own when they make packages.  It would be helpful if we
provided some for them to install which covered the command line options (much
like how we ship an icon).
The contributed man pages are obviously out of date :-)

Billy, given that you have contacts with several linux distros who generate man
pages for their eclipse builds, do you know if they would be willing to donate
them to the Eclipse project.  

Man pages do not change that much and are usually quite rudimentary and refer to
other documentation for further details, such as the online help.  It might be
sufficient to update man pages once a release cycle.

Yes, Unix manual pages are traditionally just 'quick reference cards' for the
command, library or other entity they describe. They shouldn't really be longer
than one printed page - if a command has many options, they should just mention
the most-used ones. They're meant to refer the reader to the full user
documentation and any related commands etc. I view them also as an index to the
full documentation of a Unix (Linux, Solaris etc.) system.

(Some people delight in pointing out that the notation used for traditional Unix
manual pages (troff procedural markup) is obsolescent, but that's not the point.
Until someone comes along with a new widely-adopted standard, I'd rather stick
to the old standard.)

If manual pages could be generated automatically from the full documentation, so
much the better. Several things I've come across - e.g. the HOL/Z/etc formal
methods proof editor/checker ProofPower - do that very successfully.

The issue with generating man pages with from the full documentation is that the
the doc is 30MB zipped.  Providing the full documentation in man format increase
the size of the *nix drops by 30MB. Eclipse is large enough as it is :-)

I think that a simple man page that provided users with the commands they need
to start eclipse and pointed them to the online help would be useful without
significantly increasing the size of the drop.

I think this matter is closed.

eclipse man page for RHEL
This is an old bug and I don't think we will ever fix it since we don't package the eclipse linux drop, we just provide a tarball and this is will not change.  Perhaps this could be covered by the linux distros project or the packaging project.
Why don't we just put the man pages in the hairball?
(In reply to comment #15)
&gt; Why don't we just put the man pages in the hairball?
+1. Getting it there does not hurt at all, or will not make it any more hairy.
I don't really see the benefit of including the man page with the Linux drops.  The reason is that when the user extracts the drop the man page won't be in the correct place to be displayed when they type "man eclipse".  But perhaps someone else could provide insight.

You're right about the location.  Could they perhaps just be in the src drops?  Then we (the Linux distros) can put them into the right place in our packages?
Andrew, please reopen this bug with patch to include it in our source drops if you are interested.

Sonia, how do you want to procede?
*** Bug 30106 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
adding Kevin H. to the discussion.
More info from Kevin:

The contents of the man pages should reflect any on-line help that would
be generated (e.g., eclipse -help). See bug # 25334.

The motif man file (man/man1/eclipse-motif.1) is really misnamed. It
should be: man/man1/eclipse.1.

The actual man page contents are probably out of date. I am not sure
whether the switches listed are still valid or whether they should even be
documented. This is related to the on-line help mentioned above. Again, the
contents should indicate ECLIPSE(1) and not ECLIPSE-MOTIF(1).

The -showsplash and -endsplash (which doesn't exist) switches should not
be documented since they are private switches between the launcher and the
Eclipse core.

If these man pages are to be shipped, then the main "eclipse" directory
(where the launcher resides when installed) will need a "man/man1" directory
(e.g. &lt;installDir&gt;/eclipse/man/man1) where the man page file will reside.
The user will then have to add the top man directory to the existing MANPATH
as follows:

/bin/sh:   MANPATH=${MANPATH}:&lt;installDir&gt;/eclipse/man; export MANPATH
/bin/csh:  setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:&lt;installDir&gt;/eclipse/man

With a real product install, such as WebSphere Workbench, the install
mechanism could put this man directory into a better location on disk. With
Eclipse being shipped as a ZIP file, this is harder to do.

To add the man pages does not require a change to the launcher.  This is really 
a build/install issue.

Moving to releng to consider.
Can we revive this bug report?  It would be really nice to ship some man pages
with eclipse.  Some Linux distributions (Red Hat and Debian, at least) are
currently creating their own when they make packages.  It would be helpful if we
provided some for them to install which covered the command line options (much
like how we ship an icon).
The contributed man pages are obviously out of date :-)

Billy, given that you have contacts with several linux distros who generate man
pages for their eclipse builds, do you know if they would be willing to donate
them to the Eclipse project.  

Man pages do not change that much and are usually quite rudimentary and refer to
other documentation for further details, such as the online help.  It might be
sufficient to update man pages once a release cycle.

Yes, Unix manual pages are traditionally just 'quick reference cards' for the
command, library or other entity they describe. They shouldn't really be longer
than one printed page - if a command has many options, they should just mention
the most-used ones. They're meant to refer the reader to the full user
documentation and any related commands etc. I view them also as an index to the
full documentation of a Unix (Linux, Solaris etc.) system.

(Some people delight in pointing out that the notation used for traditional Unix
manual pages (troff procedural markup) is obsolescent, but that's not the point.
Until someone comes along with a new widely-adopted standard, I'd rather stick
to the old standard.)

If manual pages could be generated automatically from the full documentation, so
much the better. Several things I've come across - e.g. the HOL/Z/etc formal
methods proof editor/checker ProofPower - do that very successfully.

The issue with generating man pages with from the full documentation is that the
the doc is 30MB zipped.  Providing the full documentation in man format increase
the size of the *nix drops by 30MB. Eclipse is large enough as it is :-)

I think that a simple man page that provided users with the commands they need
to start eclipse and pointed them to the online help would be useful without
significantly increasing the size of the drop.

I don't think you read my posting very carefully. :-)

Which is pretty much what I said.

I think this matter is closed.

eclipse man page for RHEL
This is an old bug and I don't think we will ever fix it since we don't package the eclipse linux drop, we just provide a tarball and this is will not change.  Perhaps this could be covered by the linux distros project or the packaging project.
Why don't we just put the man pages in the hairball?
(In reply to comment #15)
&gt; Why don't we just put the man pages in the hairball?
+1. Getting it there does not hurt at all, or will not make it any more hairy.
I don't really see the benefit of including the man page with the Linux drops.  The reason is that when the user extracts the drop the man page won't be in the correct place to be displayed when they type "man eclipse".  But perhaps someone else could provide insight.

You're right about the location.  Could they perhaps just be in the src drops?  Then we (the Linux distros) can put them into the right place in our packages?
Andrew, please reopen this bug with patch to include it in our source drops if you are interested.

we have 2 classes for handling modifiers (or flags if you wish)
Flags, and Modifier
they both contain the same methods  but it's not clear if they are compatible

so when NamingConventions.suggestGetter name has a parameter 'modifiers' 
i'm not sure what to feed it with
Both are equivalent. The DOM one is actually a duplicate.

Both are implemented in term of the spec values (from the VM spec book), thus 
whichever constant you use should not make a difference.

I agree though it is confusing.

DOM Modifiers should redirect to Flags.
Added clarifying comments to Flags, Modifiers, and NamingConventions.
Verified.</WithStack>

On platforms with a gray list background (like Motif) the white background of
the modules icon sticks out. It should have a transarent icon like other windows.

Steps to reproduce:

- create the following class

- activte change method signature the constructor
- press tab, 2 x cursor down
- press remove button
- press remove button
- press preview

you get the exception from above. The problem is that the tabel cursor is 
asking the table for an item at line 1 which doesn't exist anymore.

Shouldn't the table cursor adjust itself when items get removed from the table. 
Moving to SWT for commenting.
Forgot to atttached the sample class

public class Test {
	public Test(int a, int i, int y) {
	}
}

When we remove an item we explicitly set the visibility of the table cursor to 
false.
Dirk, did you actually mean to attach code or were you being funny?  You need 
to dispose the table cursor before disposing items.
The code was for the test case I described.

When the exception happens the table still exists and has one item in it. What 
do you mean with we have to dispose the table cursor. It is a composite with 
the table as its parent so it should behave well as long as the table exists, 
independenly how many items are in the table. Especially when we set the table 
cursor's visibility to false.
Sorry Dirk my mistake.

I have just talked to Veronika and she believes you should destroy the 
TableCursor for now.
Not sure if this is same or different.  I'm running Linux-GTK, j2sdk 1.4.1 rc,
eclipse I20030129.  In trying to pull up a method, the log shows...

i tried removing 2 last params from the constructor of RenameFieldRefactoring
(first modify the construcotr so that it ignores the parameters)

this happened when i pressed preview (the preview came up but was the 
layout was all messed up)

Steps to reproduce:

- create the following class

- activte change method signature the constructor
- press tab, 2 x cursor down
- press remove button
- press remove button
- press preview

The declaration source start of 'i' should be the 'p' of its public modifiers.

    <WithStack>Build: 200301221039

I'm getting an NPE when making an invalid selection in the Plug-in selection 
dialog opened from the Plug-in dependencies view.

Steps to reproduce:
1 - Open PDE Plug-in dependencies view
2 - Open the context menu and select "Focus on..." option
3 - Instead of selecting one of the listed plug-ins, select one of the groups 
(either "Workspace plug-ins" or "External plug-ins")
4 - Notice that the Ok button is still enabled. Click it.
Result: nothing happens, and a NPE is logged (will attach).
Created attachment 3109
Log excerpt
Thanks for the catch. We added a line that disables 'OK' button when the group 
objects are selected.

The fix will appear in the next build. In the mean time, just don't press 'OK' 
when these objects are selected :-).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If a schema file was created for the sole purpose of being included into other 
schema files, when the html docs are generated, would it not be appropriate to 
not generate an html doc file for the "include" schema file (given that the

Right now, we get an html doc for schema files that only exist to be included 
in other schema files. I'm manually deleting these for the moment...
The final solution we will use in Eclipse is to generate documentation using 
PDE Ant task, so docs will be generated during the build and you will not need 
to maintain local copies.

For now, you can rename schemas that are used just for inclusion to *.mxsd 
(don't forget to change the 'include' element as well). The builder only 
generates documentation for *.exsd files.

Ant task starts from the model, looks up 'schema' attribute in extension point 
elements and loads schema objects to generate docs. This means that included
schemas will be loaded as part of the parent schema object creation.
Since included schemas are not referenced directly in manifests, 
they will not appear in the reference docs.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If I add an included element to a compositor, from the properties view, I 
cannot change the max/minOccurs properties. I can however, modify the source 
code directly.
Right - that is because method 'getSchema()' for the element reference returns 
the schema from the actual referenced element that is in the included schema 
(which is read-only). I changed the implementation of 'getSchema()' to return 
the schema of the compositor (the grammer container of the reference). Since 
compositors always belong to the parent schema, the correct schema object is 
used to notify changes and to test for editable flag.

Tested and released.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Eclipse 2.0 (build 200206271827)

I create markers of my own type using the same method as when searching Help pages:

ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().createMarker("my.marker.id");

and then set its attributes the usual way and add it to the search result view.
This all works and my "GotoMarkerAction" can recognize the custom type and
retrieve from the marker attributes the information it needs to open the
resource that marker is referring to (a URL).

However, when I use Search Results view's "Previous search results" button to go
back to my search, although the matches are redisplayed and the attributes are
still there on markers, the marker type is changed to
"org.eclipse.search.searchmarker". This throws off my GotoMarkerAction, which
relied on looking for a custom marker type.

Shouldn't the marker type be also restored in this case?
It should. I will have a look tomorrow morning.
OK, I see the problem: currently the Search infrastructure does not handle sub
types of org.eclipse.search.searchmarker correctly in every case.

Good finding!

As a workaround, you could simply use the existing search marker type like all
other Search clients (Java, NLS, Help) do - or does your marker inherit from
more than one super type?

No, it has only one supertype (search.searchmarker right now, although come to
think of it, there really isn't any reason why it shouldn't be directly
descendent from resources.marker). I was using the marker type so that other of
my plugin's classes that may be passed a marker could tell what it is right away
and know that certain attributes will be there for sure.
&gt; there really isn't any reason why it shouldn't be directly
&gt; descendent from resources.marker
If you want your markers displayed in the Search result view your marker either
has to inherit from org.eclipse.search.searchmarker or you use
org.eclipse.search.searchmarker directly (i.e. create markers of that type). If
you don't need to publish new attributes as API i.e. you only internally add new
attributes then I suggest to use org.eclipse.search.searchmarker. This would fix
your problem immediately and reduces the size of you plugin.xml.</WithStack>

I got into a state today where the label of one my views was disposed.  I was in
a java perspective, and I believe the outline view had focus when the error
happened.  I had just been selecting various methods in the outline while
browsing through a class.  After that point, every attempt to change focus to
another view caused the error to occur. I cannot reproduce it.  Log file attached.
Created attachment 3113
Log file showing stack trace
The stack trace in the log shows that the widget is disposed but we need to 
reproduce it to find out where the widget was disposed. Not sure if anything 
can be done here until we manage to reproduce it.

Have you seen this again?
No, haven't seen it
There is nothing I can do here without a reproduceble case. I have looked in 
the code to see if I could find the cause for this problem but I did not see 
the place where we could be disposing de widget prematurely.

I will close this as WORKSFORME. Please reopen if you see this again.</WithStack>

We had that mode of diffing in our previous product VAME, but usersliked the side by side mode better. The inline mode is good for small changes,but it doesn't work well for large changes.Will reconsider after 2.1
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

    <WithStack>There is a need for a way to supply infopops for the launch configuration
types as they are listed in the Launch Configuraiton Dialog and on the 'Debug 
As' menu.

If products ship a significant number of launch configurations, it might be
very helpful for the customers to get a 'real' infopop with the links to the 
appropriate docs instead of just a simple tooltip.
We would likely need to add optional "help context id" attributes to the 
launchShortcut and launchConfigurationTabGroup extension points. Since the 
mapping of shortcut to launch config type is not restricted to a 1:1 
releationship (i.e. there can be multiple shortcuts for a launch config type),

    <WithOutStack>There is a need for a way to supply infopops for the launch configuration
types as they are listed in the Launch Configuraiton Dialog and on the 'Debug 
As' menu.

If products ship a significant number of launch configurations, it might be
very helpful for the customers to get a 'real' infopop with the links to the 
appropriate docs instead of just a simple tooltip.
We would likely need to add optional "help context id" attributes to the 
launchShortcut and launchConfigurationTabGroup extension points. Since the 
mapping of shortcut to launch config type is not restricted to a 1:1 
releationship (i.e. there can be multiple shortcuts for a launch config type), 
we must specify on a per shortcut basis.

    <WithStack>I'm having trouble getting a dialog to open with the initial selection shown. 
I've stepped through the code and everything seems to be fine until I 
hit FilteredList$TableUpdater.run(). In here, it resets the table 
selection to item 0 (FilteredList.java line 509). This happens after the 
showSelection() method in Table.class. 

The order I'm creating/setting things is:

dialog = new ElementListSelectionDialog(...)
dialog.setIgnoreCase(false)
dialog.setMultipleSelection(true)
dialog.setElements(...)
dialog.setInitialSelection(...)
dialog.open()


The elements in the initialSelection list are in the elements list 
(FilteredList.setSelection(Object[] elements) finds and matches them ok). 

When the dialog is shown, the first element is selected, but only as a 
"non-focused control" selection.
Moving to Lynne as she is looking at this dialog right now.
Please give me an example demonstrating your problem.  I am running the current 
2.1 build.  If I run the following, the items are selected and focus is in the 
text field (as expected).

While stepping through code iterating over an array, I wanted to see a field 
of one of the elements while iterating, so I expanded the loop variable for 
the element.  However, every time I looped around, the variable for the 
element went out of scope, and the next time it entered the scope, it was 
collapsed.  I had to expand it each time.

The code in question is:

	private void rehash() {
		int length = elementData.length&lt;&lt;1;
		if (length == 0) length = 1;
		firstSlot = length;
		lastSlot = -1;
		HashMapEntry[] newData = new HashMapEntry[length];
		for (int i=elementData.length; --i &gt;= 0;) {
			HashMapEntry entry = elementData[i];
			while (entry != null) {
				int index = (hashCode(entry.key) &amp; 0x7FFFFFFF) 
% length;
				if(index &lt; firstSlot) firstSlot = index;
				if(index &gt; lastSlot) lastSlot = index;
				HashMapEntry next = entry.next;
				entry.next = newData[index];
				newData[index] = entry;
				entry = next;
			}
		}
		elementData = newData;
		computeMaxSize();
	}  

The loop variable "entry" is the one going in and out of scope.

Actually, I was really interested in a field (called fId) of the current key 
(instance TestElement in the JFace tests).
So I wanted both the expansion of "entry" to be remembered, and the expansion 
of "entry.key".

Basically, I think it would be a great advantage if it remembered all expanded 
paths in terms of variable and field names, e.g. {"entry", "key"}, rather than 
in terms of actual JDI variable and field references, so that when the JDI 
refs go out of scope, the expansion state still gets remembered.

It would be best if it remembered this per-frame, so if I stepped into another 
method then back out, I wouldn't lose the expansion state.  But I could live 
with it if it was just for the current frame.

    <WithStack>When clicking OK after changing the Javadoc URL field for a JVM under Installed
JREs, Eclipse takes a long time to do something while the UI is completely
unresponsive (including screen paints) without so much as an hourglass pointer.

1. This should be sped up (if possible).
2. Eclipse should still paint itself.
3. User should get an hourglass pointer (minimum) or some sort of progress dialog.
Not sure if this is us or Debug. This the page is owned by Debug I think they 
are resonsible to setup the operation the right way. Martin told me that 
setting the Javadoc location is fast.
What version of Eclipse? Since M4, we have added progress reporting when a 
build takes place, and we have better "re-build" detection, such that we do not 
build when a source attachment or javadoc location changes.

I'm using 2.1 M4.  Also, I've set it several times, and it takes a long time
everytime (like 60-120 sec).  It also doesn't seem to matter if the Javadoc is
local or on the network.

BTW, the long pause is not when you close the "Edit JRE" dialog, but when you
close the Preferences dialog.
Please try with the latest build - these problems have been fixed.

    <WithStack>When a user changes an attribute initializer, or an element's JavaDoc in the
Eclipse source editor, the events fired to registered IElementChangedListener do
not have the details of the initializer and JavaDoc changes in the
IJavaElementDelta.

The only data the IElementChangedListener receives is an IJavaElementDelta for
the ICompilationUnit, with only the flags F_FINE_GRAINED and F_CONTENT, and no
further nested IJavaElementDeltas. This data is insufficient to determine what
exactly has changed in the source code.

It would be helpful if the IJavaElementDelta for the ICompilationUnit had a
nested delta element for the IField in case of attribute initializer changes,
and, for JavaDoc changes, a delta element for the element with the modified JavaDoc.
The JavaModel currently has no knowledge of javadocs, and more generally any 
comment. Therefore, a javadoc change will not be reflected as a method change.

We may revisit this behavior post 2.1, and provide Javadoc manipulation APIs.
Thanks, Philippe.

Does the Java Model also not keep track of attribute initializers? If it does,
could events for attribute initializer changes be introduced?
In addition to attribute initializers, and JavaDoc comments, there are no Java
model events fired when method parameters' names are changed in the source code.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

I got some errors at the consol during indexing when I used the NLS Language
package.

Steps
1. Extract the eclipse-SDK.zip 
2. Extract the NLS Language package (eclipse-nls-SDK-2.0.x.zip) under the same
directory
3. launch the eclipse (./eclipse -vm /opt/IBMJava131/jre/bin/javaw)
4. Open the Help
5. Input DBCS characters in the search field and Go to the Search
During the indexing, the Lexical error are occurred.
Created attachment 3117
the error messages

Here is the error messages at the consol.
The problem is valid.  I have reproduced it with 2.1 buils, as well as with
2.0.2 build.  The problem also exists on Windows, but the console is not
normally displayed if eclipse launched from eclipse.exe

The documents seem correct, display fine.  The character set is specified
correctly, the docment is decoded, but the parser fails to parse them.  The
error alwasy occurs around the first character of the value of the alt attribute
in the img element.
I have tried zh_CN locale and documents.  The same problem appears.
Adding an option 
 UNICODE_INPUT = true;
to the file
 org.apache.lucene.demo.html.HTMLParser.jj,
regenerating the parser and recompling it fixes the problem.

However, currently we do not modify or build Lucene in Eclipse.  The libraries 
are downloaded from Apache and used as is.

If this bug is left unfixed, any document that contains DBCS characters in 
attributes is only indexed until that attribute.  After the error, the rest of 
the file is ignored.  The search results also do not list all hits that should 
be found.  Some documents are ommited from results as they were not fully 
indexed.

This is a second bug, in addition to bug 20935, that exists in the Lucene demo 
parser and requires that we alter apache code and rebuild, or find a different 
parser to use in help.
Fixed, by changing and recompiling lucene HTMLParser.
Verified successfully with I20030206 driver. Though, I got another error, so I 
will open a new defect.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>AFAIK the tab bootstrap in the launcher doesn't allow me to use the given
classes as prefix which is necessary for using e.g. visibroker with jdk 1.4.
Correct, we do not support the prefix option. You must provide a complete 
bootpath.

As a workaround, can you just use the default entries in the list, and then add 
you entries before the default entries?
yup. works :-).
Marking as later, to consider post 2.1 (i.e. feature of prefixing bootpath)
Having the custom entries before the default entries doesn't work anymore (using
Build 200303071024 (RC2)).
Please provide more details - what does your classpath/bootpath look like, and 
what is the corresponding command line that we generate (visible from the 
properties of the associated debug target/process in the debug view)?
It seems like Eclipse ignores the defined variables added to the xbootclasspath.
I defined vbjorb.jar, lm.jar, and vbsec.jar to be in the first positions in the
xbootclasspath, but apparently they don't appear. This is necessary for
Visibroker to work, since we must not use the JDK ORB. Here the generated
output, I added a return after each jar in order to increase readability:

-classpath ...
What variables are on the bootpath, and do they appear with correct values in 
the "classpath variables" preference page?
Created attachment 4172
Screenshot of XBootClasspath

here's a screenshot of my xbootclasspath settings
Created attachment 4173
Screenshot of classpath variables preference
the paths to the jars are correct, btw.
I can reproduce the problem. It appears the variable entries are appearing on 
the classpath rather than the bootpath - do you see the entries on the "-
classpath" portion of the command line?
yep... first entries after -classpath. If you need my classpath as well, I could
provide it...
I should be able to determine the problem now that I can reproduce it. Marking 
as RC3 candidate, CC'ing EG for approval.
thx :-).
yes
Fixed. The "classpath property" of the variable entries were not being 
propogated to the resolved entries. Noted that we had the same problem for 
projects with multiple (non-default) output locations on the bootpath.

Added cartesian product of tests (21) to ClasspathProviderTests:
(USER_CLASSES | BOOTPATH_CLASSES | STANDARD_CLASSES) *
(variable | extended variable | project | folder | archive | multi-output 
project | container)
Please verify, Joe.
Verified.

Fixed for me as well. Everything works :-)). Thanks again.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>AFAIK the tab bootstrap in the launcher doesn't allow me to use the given
classes as prefix which is necessary for using e.g. visibroker with jdk 1.4.
Correct, we do not support the prefix option. You must provide a complete 
bootpath.

As a workaround, can you just use the default entries in the list, and then add 
you entries before the default entries?
yup. works :-).
Marking as later, to consider post 2.1 (i.e. feature of prefixing bootpath)
Having the custom entries before the default entries doesn't work anymore (using
Build 200303071024 (RC2)).
Please provide more details - what does your classpath/bootpath look like, and 
what is the corresponding command line that we generate (visible from the 
properties of the associated debug target/process in the debug view)?
It seems like Eclipse ignores the defined variables added to the xbootclasspath.
I defined vbjorb.jar, lm.jar, and vbsec.jar to be in the first positions in the
xbootclasspath, but apparently they don't appear. This is necessary for
Visibroker to work, since we must not use the JDK ORB. Here the generated
output, I added a return after each jar in order to increase readability:

it rather looks like CVS is blocking here.

To my point of view, file 1.12 should be 1.4 or something like this, because 
ealier than file 1.6. It seems version 1.12 has been done for demonstration

    <WithStack>Given an eclipse plugin that defines a custom perspective, we need a mechanism
to make Eclipse start up with this perspective opened by default, without the
user having to open the perspective manually.

Currently, we're modifying the UI (org.eclipse.ui) plugin's workbench.xml file
to persuade Eclipse to open our custom perspective on startup, but a cleaner way
to do this would be great.
Moving to Update/Intall for comment.
If you are shipping your own Eclipse-based product, you can change the default 
values for the preferences (in this case, you want to change the default 
perspective preference).

    <WithStack>The new IResourceProxyVisitor results in signficant speed-ups when processing 
the resource trees as long as you do not need the full path of the resource.

The AmountOfWorkCalculator is a candidate for leveraging the new 
IResourceProxyVisitor. Please investigate.

Core Comments from eclipse-dev:

In today's integration build (20030114), there is new API in the
org.eclipse.core.resources plugin for performing optimized traversals of
resource trees.  The optimization works by avoiding the creation of transient
Path and IResource handles during the traversal of tree elements that you are
not interested in visiting.  Instead, the visitor is given a resource proxy,
from which various information can be obtained without any garbage being
created.  The new API entry point is: 

IResource.accept(IResourceProxyVisitor, int). 

If you currently use IResourceVisitor, you should switch to the new API if any
of the following is true: 

 - your visitor is not interested in every resource in the subtree being visited
(for example, you only care about folders, files ending in .xml, derived
resources, etc.). 

- your visitor only needs the simple resource name, or other simple information
that is available from the resource proxy. 

- your visitor is interested in the full resource path, but doesn't need access
to the resource handle 

If you don't already use IResourceVisitor, but you currently traverse
significant subtrees using IContainer.members(), you may also benefit from
switching to this new API.  One great example is code that traverses a subtree
to count the number of resources in order to initialize a progress monitor (for
example the method #countChildrenOf in most ExportOperation classes).  Some
other spots that could see huge performance gains are
LaunchManager.searchForFiles and SearchForBuildFilesDialog.searchForBuildFiles). 

We are switching to use this visitor internally in the resources plugin, and we
have seen speed improvements up to 22x over the old visitor implementation in
the best case.  In the worst case, this visitor is still as fast as the old
visitor, although slightly less convenient to use due to the extra indirection
of the proxy.  From glancing through the senders of the old accept method, it
looks like most existing resource visitors can take advantage of this.  If you
have further questions, please send them to the platform-core-dev mailing list.

    <WithStack>In a plugin's plugin.xml, we can define a perspective extension where custom
views can be stacked with existing views. However, it is not possible to change
the stacking order, so that the custom view appears above the existing view.

An additional attribute for the view element, to set the stacking order would be
good to have, so that, for example, we could write:

&lt;perspectiveExtension targetID="..."&gt;
&lt;view relative="org.eclipse.ui.views.TaskList" relationship="stack" 
visible="true" id="com.xyz.myview" stackorder="1"/&gt;
&lt;/perspectiveExtension&gt;
There are currently no plans to work on this feature</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>In a plugin's plugin.xml, we can define a perspective extension where custom
views can be stacked with existing views. However, it is not possible to change
the stacking order, so that the custom view appears above the existing view.

An additional attribute for the view element, to set the stacking order would be
good to have, so that, for example, we could write:

&lt;perspectiveExtension targetID="..."&gt;
&lt;view relative="org.eclipse.ui.views.TaskList" relationship="stack" 
visible="true" id="com.xyz.myview" stackorder="1"/&gt;

I did some more testing

it has something to do with the array index [0] 
if i only select currentSelectedListItems then it inspect/displays it correctly
if i also select [0] then the error occurs

currentSelectedListItem is not a member of the innerclass but one of the 
outerclass...

Fixed.
That was a error/typo.
Change in ArrayAccess#execute()

To use the 'extract local' refactoring, you have to first select the full 
expression, which takes as much time than doing a cut. It also shows a dialog 
for the name.

Better would be if is can be used on a 0-length cursor (e.g. at the beginning 
of an expression), and if the name would be guessed (and maybe the linked 
rename mode is enabled)
the name is guessed if the expression ends in a call to a getter 

field.foo().bar().getFred() -&gt; guessed name is fred

0-length is problematic: which expression do i take?
i agree though that less ui would be better here (in-place)
question is what to do with the 'replace all?' question that appears in the 
dialog? sometimes that's what you want, sometimes not
I think we should try to support 0-length when it is clear which expression to 
take. I was tricked by this as well. Can't we come up with something here ?
usually you would position the cursor at the beginning of the expression you 
want to extract.

Name guessing is usually done with the type to which the expression resolves.

If you detect more places of the same expression ('replace all') you could 
bring an extra dialog.
Maybe its the best to make a quick assist for this, so you would see the the 
preview
But for 2.1 we will not convert it into a quick assist. Sine we don't have a 
satisfying stroy for refactorings and quick assist we shouldn't start 
converting singel refactorings. Additionally with the new short cuts it's 
faster to open the refactoring directly than using quick assist.
extract method fails too
and extract constant

so, how 'bout we postpone it now and fix then for all 3?
defer
to be investigated
We should at least solve the 0-length case for extract local and constant for 
M3. I will take care about extract method.

    <WithStack>Scenario: In the Java browsing perspective, select a project, package, type 
and member of the type. Also select some text in the editor. Now browse to a 
different project. The browse back to the first project. Eclipse will now have 
forgotten which package, type and member was selected. The text selection will 
also be forgotten.

It would be very convenient if, for every element (on each level of the 
project-package-type-member-text hierarchy) Eclipse could remember the 
selection. This is the way we (fondly) remember VAJ did it.

The current behaviour is especially annoying when you use the hierarchical 
layout of the Packages view, since the hierarchy collapses (this is a bug in 
itself, the expansion state should be remembered, see 28990). In fact, these 
two issues together makes the hierarchical layout of doubtful value.
This will not make it in for 2.1. Postponing
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

Found 1 deadlock.
Philippe's scenario looks like a variant of bug 28671 (we don't have deadlock, 
but a huge number of messages being processed by the UI thread prevents a 
synchronous runnable to get executed).

Here, again, the refresh local operation has already finished but, differently 
than the other case, the *progress monitor* is blocked waiting for a chance to 
have a runnable executed by the UI thread (it was one of the resource change 
listeners in the other bug).

Johan, your dump does not include any workspace operation being executed, and 
it seems it is related to class loading. Have you logged it only in this PR?
Actually, it only saw it "deadlocking" 10 minutes &lt;g&gt;, I killed it at that 
point... could have just taken an enormous amount of time.
i also reported it under bug 31074 yes (where i believe it somehow a 
classloading thing)

So I recommend this bug to be marked as duplicate of bug 28671 (I do not have 
rights for doing it).

I did a project refresh (it had changed on the filesystem), and had to kill my 
Java VM after a 10 minutes wait (it should only have taken seconds).

Found 1 deadlock.
Philippe's scenario looks like a variant of bug 28671 (we don't have deadlock, 
but a huge number of messages being processed by the UI thread prevents a 
synchronous runnable to get executed).

Here, again, the refresh local operation has already finished but, differently 
than the other case, the *progress monitor* is blocked waiting for a chance to 
have a runnable executed by the UI thread (it was one of the resource change 
listeners in the other bug).

Johan, your dump does not include any workspace operation being executed, and 
it seems it is related to class loading. Have you logged it only in this PR?
Actually, it only saw it "deadlocking" 10 minutes &lt;g&gt;, I killed it at that 
point... could have just taken an enormous amount of time.
i also reported it under bug 31074 yes (where i believe it somehow a 
classloading thing)

So I recommend this bug to be marked as duplicate of bug 28671 (I do not have 
rights for doing it).

    <WithStack>Java resources reside in the same name space as Java types, so it should be 
possible to view the in the same view (subject to filtering, of course).

I am aware that this (or similar) issue has been raised before, but I am not 
satisfied with the Package Explorer + Java type filter solution. The Package 
Explorer does not belong in the Java Browsing perspective it is half Projects, 
half Packages, and not good at either.
Postponed &gt; 2.1
Reopen to mark was wontfix.
As the name indicates the Types view shows Java types. To edit resources in the
Java Browsing perspective do one of the following:
- use Ctrl+Shift+R
- replace the Projects view with the Package Explorer and set the filter to hide
the Java elements
- add the Navigator to the perspective

So, change the name of the Types view. I want a view that satisfies the 
following:
-Is coupled to the Projects + Packages view (just like Types is) and only 
shows what is in the selected package
-shows types and (switchable) resources

Navigator/Package Explorer does not do this. Ctrl-shift-r does nothing for me.
&gt;Ctrl-shift-r does nothing for me.
What do you mean? Does it not work? Note: this is a 2.1 feature. You can also
open it using Navigate&gt;Open Resource


Ah, ok. Now I see what it does. Not what I'm looking for either, sorry. (ctrl-
shift-r only seems to be available if the Navigator has focus, btw)
Should not be bound to the navigator. Works for me when the editor or another
view is selected.
Note: There might be views (most-likely views that are not part of the Eclipse
SDK and that did not yet adapt to 2.1).</WithStack>

	6. Select "Create a new repository location", then click Next
	
&lt;&lt;Error&gt;&gt;
	After step 6, the workbench core dump.
	Please refer the attachment (cvs_defect.zip)

&lt;&lt;Expected Result&gt;&gt;
	It should create a new repository location successfully without core 
dump.

Likely the same issue that is causing Bug 26732
I tested it with build I20030129-linux-gtk with gtk 2.2.
This problem doesn't occurs on gtk2.2
I've reviewed this. It's a problem of gtk2.0.6
ok to close then?
This bug doesn't exist on CHS RedHat8.0 with GTK+ 2.2.  Please change its

    <WithStack>In Java you can declare local variables just about anywhere in the code. That 
makes it difficult to, at a glance, see if a variable is local, a parameter or 
a instance or static field of the class. Naming conventions are often imposed 
to remedy this. However, different shops have a habit adopting different 
naming conventions, and you are increasingly likely to use toolkits in source 
form from a number of different origins. 

It would be helpful if it was possible to assign different colors to 
identifiers by their scope, so that e.g. fields and local variables would 
stand out as different in the editor.

    <WithStack>If I set "Indentation is represented by a tab" in Window-Preferences-Java-Code 
Formatter-Style, then when I press enter after the { in the code below (the dot 
represents the cursor position):
   if (something)
   {.
the result is as expected, i.e:
   if (something)
   {
      .
Howerver, if I do not set the above option (which is what I want), then I get:
   if (something)
   {
         .
This is very annoying as I have to continually delete the extra spaces that are 
inserted.
How the indentation looks depends on your settings. There are two settings: One 
that talks about the usage of tabs and the other one talking about how many 
spaces are representing an indentation level. The example you give makes me 
believe that your value fir the latter setting is 8.
I still think its a BUG because I use the following settings:

Window-Preferences-Java-Editor: Appearance Tab
----------------------------------------------
Displayed Tab Width = 8

Window-Preferences-Java-Code Formatter: Style Tab
-------------------------------------------------
Insert tabs for indentation, not spaces is DISABLED
Number of spaces representing an indentation level = 3

I use these so that I can spot when TABS have been inserted incorrectly via 
other editors because the print view will be tabbed to 8 instead of 3.

BUG 28454 seems to have a patch for this - why don't you use it?

If you know that this is a dup, why aren't you marking it as one?

    <WithStack>Trying to create a project (or file or folder) with

The problem happens only if not Russian locale set for computer.
Created attachment 3119
Error box (no log written)
Created attachment 3120
Local setting used
This happens if locale does not support language used.
For example, with cyrrilic language
and Russian or Bulgarian locales it works but with English(US)
does not.

Also noted that if workspace contains projects or files
named in cyrrilic they appears as not visible... for example,
prjects are displayed as closed and error log contains:
!MESSAGE Problems occurred while restoring the workspace.
!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.core.resources 4 567 Jan 24, 2003 14:47:30.729
!MESSAGE The project description file (.project) for ןמן56 is missing.  This 
file contains important information about the project.  The project will not 
function properly until this file is restored.
!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.core.resources 4 567 Jan 24, 2003 14:47:30.729
!MESSAGE The project description file (.project) for נממ7ד8מנכן is missing.  
This file contains important information about the project.  The project will 
not function properly until this file is restored.

I think the reason is that when eclipse writes files it uses default encoding, 
which is set by jvm in file.encoding property. That is wrong. Eclipse should 
depending on OS (if OS supports UNICODE) set encoding to UNICODE-encoding (such 
as UTF-8, UTF-16, USC-2 etc.) used in OS.
DJ: this may have been fixed as the result of fixing bug 13463.
Closing.
Please re-open is this problem still occurs in build M5 or later.

    <WithStack>If i setup Baltik languages and Latvian locale,
then files and folders in OS appears to be wrongly named.

For example, if i create a project named in latvian with special
letters (you can enter them by right Alt and a letter on keyboard),
then they are displayed correctly in eclipse view,
but not in OS file system. This is not a problem of OS, as soon
as i can enter files and folders names in OS directly.

Moreover, file properties displays file path correctly.

This was revealed when trying to export/import this project, as soon
as it failed to export by Browse button.
But if i enter path manually (with correct project name) then it is imported.

Look attach picture

Note: i have 4 languages active in my OS: latvian, bulgarian, english, russian.
Created attachment 3121
Workspace, file system and project properties
Additional investigation showed that it happens
when default language does not correspond computer locale.
Defaulkt language effects in file.encoding JVM property.
If you try create resources NOT in file.encoding codepage
Eclipse convert characters and that is bad.

Seems like Eclipse creates file names not in UTF8?
More precisely:
When some strings collected by eclipse is going to be filenames, they are 
transformed into byte arrays with String.getBytes() or so. This getBytes() uses 
default encoding, set in file.encoding property. This property is set by JVM on 
startup to current windows locale. It is usually non-UNICODE encoding (such as 
Cp1251).
Eclipse should depending on underlying OS use UNICODE-encoding where possible 
(UTF-8, UTF-16, USC-2...) (I dont quite remember which one is to be used in 
Windows 2000/XP). So you need to use getBytes("UTF-16") or so everywhere in 
output to filesystem.
Could you please inform which Eclipse build and JRE provider/version you are 
using?

Some VMs do not handle file names containing characters not supported in the 
default encoding properly on Windows 2K/XP. Eclipse uses the core Java APIs and 
native calls for creating file/folders and listing directory contents. 1.4 
level VMs seem to support files containing any Unicode characters properly (if 
the OS provides support).

However, before build 20030205, Eclipse didn't handle those files properly even 
when running on 1.4 level VMs (see bug 13163).

Could you try this build with a 1.4-level VM to see if the problem persists? 
Thanks.
We are using Sun java 1.3.1_06.
Sorry but we NEED it to work on 1.3.1 (as soon as eclipse declares 1.3 support 
and we rely on this declaration in our work). And this problem certanly can be 
fixed by eclipse developers. Look my previous comment and just fix one string 
in your java code.
Forget to give you eclipse build: we are using eclipse 2.0.1 release (build 
200208291828)
Denis, we don't do any encoding when creating files and folders, we just call 
the standard Java I/O API passing Java strings (which are Unicode). So, 
although Eclipse supports 1.3 level JREs, we cannot overcome all bugs in the 
underlying JRE that avoid Eclipse of working properly.

The good news is that this bug seems to be fixed in the new Sun JRE 1.3.1_07.

From JavaSoft's bug parade:

java.io: Cannot create files with full Unicode names (Win32/NT) 
http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4185525.html

Please let us know if the problem goes away using the new VM. 
I could verify that Sun JDK/JRE 1.3.1_07 seems to effectively fix the problem. 
By the way, the bug I intended to refer to before (see comment 4) was actually 
bug 13463 (whose fix now works also on this new JRE).

DJ, I suggest this bug to be closed as works-for-me.

When willing to check the launch config, I have to manually figure what I am 
running at the moment, where I believe it should allow me to find out the exact 
launch config I used to trigger this execution.
Do you mean you want to navigate from a debug element (stack frame, thread, 
target, launch) to the launch config dialog?
Fixed.
Please verify, Joe (S).

I have added an action to the context menu in the debug view to open the launch 
dialog on the config associated with the selected debug element/process/launch. 
The action is named "XXX..." where XXX is the name of the associated config, 
and the icon is that of the launch config type.
Nice feature.  Verified.</WithStack>

This is now fixed in the current cvs tree with a test in bugs/crashes.

This was a fascinating bug, and you did an excellent job of reducing it to a 
minimal test case.  The problem had to do with ajc's attempts to optimize away 
the creation of dynamic JoinPoint objects, which can be very expensive.  Your 
code managed to confuse this optimization and caused it to generate a call to 
the method ThisJoinPoint.StaticPart.getSignature on an object that was 
statically typed to ThisJoinPoint.  This is illegal bytecode.

You should consider reporting this as a bug to SUN.  While ajc did generate 
illegal bytecode here, the correct VM behavior should have been to produce a 
VerifyError when loading the classes.  Neither the Solaris or Windows VM is 
handling this case at all well.  The Solaris VMs behavior is particularly 
troubling as it causes such a hard crash.</WithStack>

my eclipse hard-crashed and it seems that the 'number of open editors' 
preference was lost

preference pages should store their values on OK. i guess the 'Editors' page 
forgot to do it.
Preferences are stored on OK - this is likely a problem with the preference 
page.
Turned out to be indicative of a larger problem - nothing using a 
AbstractUIPluginPreference store was being saved. Well spotted Adam.

    <WithStack>Searching for alphanumeric strings in the form CMN00000E returned these results:

CMN	files found all occurrences of CMN are highlighted
CMN? 	nothing found 
CMN*	nothing found
"CMN"	nothing found

StoreOpenCmd - returns 3 files containing StoreOpenCmd (correct result)
StoreOpen* - returns nothing
StoreOpen? - returns nothing
"StoreOpenCmd" - returns 3 files containing StoreOpenCmd (correct result)

search strings containing punctuation marks are not correctly highlighted
Explanation: returns results highlighting appropriately
"Explanation:" returns the same files results are not highlighted
When searching in English, use lower case for search string
CMN* - type cmn*
StoreOpen* - type storeopen*

"Explanation:" - puntuation is ignored by the search engine, even when doing 
exact search, hence the document containing Explanation might be found, while 
it should not.  Highlighting exact search terms does not ignore punctuation, 
therefore Explanation not highlighted in that document.
With 2.1 it will be possible not to require wildcard queries be lowercase
Fixed.
CMN* should find document containing CMN00000E
I'm using a 2.1 build and CMN* does not return anything.
The fix was just release in the repository. Please check the nightly build or 
the M5 build (later next week).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The Override/Implement Methods functionality does not show static methods. It 
would be nice if it would be possible to override them too.
in Java, non-virtual (private or static) methods cannot be overriden.

what's the sementics you would expect in this case?

This seems to compile perfectly with Java 1.4. Didn't test it with 1.3 though
By the way, the place where I use this functionality seems to internally 
implemented using reflection. So indeed, this is not a very common approach. 
Mmh, looking at it this way it might not be interesting to let 
Override/Implement method support this, sorry for bothering you.
Ok, closing.</WithStack>

Java : IBM Java 1.3.1 SR-3
Client Platform : 
WindowsXP (JP, KO, TCH, SCH)
RedHat 8.0 (JP, KO, TCH, SCH)

We got the error dialog box when committing the DBCS project name into the CVS 
repository eventhough the CVS client and the server used the same encoding.

Steps: (Client: Windows XP Japanese, Server: AIX Ja_JP, cvs version: 1.11.2)
1. Create a project using DBCS characters
2. Right-click the project and select Team -&gt; Share project...
3. Select the CVS repository 
4. Select the "Use project name as module name" and Finish
5. Select the project at the Synchonize view
6. Right-click the project and select Commit...
Then I got the error dialog box. We cannot commit the DBCS project correctly.
Created attachment 3127
The erro dialog box

Please see the attached file.
I believe this problem is due to a bug in the commit caused by unadded 
resources. To verify, perform an Add to Version Control on all outgoing 
additions before you commit. If this succeeds, then the problem is due to a bug 
that is already fixed. If this fails, please append additional details.
We also have the same problem for the DBCS Folder name and File name.
After Add a version control and commit, we got the same error. 
Just to clearify, did you perform the following steps:

1) Share project as described originally

2) In sync view, select the project and choose Add to Version Control (which 
suceeded).

3) In sync view, select the project and choose Commit (which fails)

Is the error message the same as the one origically posted or are other files 
involved (i.e. is it all the files in the project or just some of them).

Also, could you perform steps 2 and 3 in the Navigator and see if you get the 
same result (for step 2, you will need to select each file individually).
I performed the steps you mentioned, I got the same error during commiting the 
project in the sync view(Step 3). For step3 in Navigator, I got the another 
error dialog. (I will attach the screenpicture.)

In addition, I started the following command (java -classpath startup.jar 
org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main). After I commited the DBCS project, I tried to 
check these files in CVS perspective(Go to CVS perspective, Select CVS Server 
and Click the HEAD).  I got the messages at the console and a .log file.  
Please see it.

Unhandled exception caught in event loop.
Reason:

I confirmed this problem was fixed with the I20030129 build, but I got an 
another problem when using the DBCS project name. I will open a new defect fot 
it.
In korea environment, still problem occurred.
Please ignore my previous comment. The problem did not occur in korean

    <WithStack>Based on the lack of documentation to implement custom syntax highlighting for 
Eclipse, I was expecting org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor to be better 
documented and thought out.

For instance, the example fails to make a clear distinction between a 
JavaCodeScanner and a JavaPartitionScanner. In fact, you can even see 
duplicated information. For example, if you wanted to change the example so 
that comments until the end of the line started with ";" instead of "//", 
where would you make the change ? JavaCodeScanner ? JavaPartitionScanner ? 
Both ?


JavaCodeScanner has this:
		// Add rule for single line comments.
		rules.add(new EndOfLineRule("//", comment)); //$NON-NLS-1$


JavaPartitionScanner has this:
		// Add rule for single line comments.
		rules.add(new EndOfLineRule("//", Token.UNDEFINED)); //$NON-
NLS-1$


Are both really needed ? Why do I need to specify the same information in 2 
separate places ? Is it a problem with the JFace design or with the example ?

How about better comments, explaining the "whys" ?
See JavaDoc of IDocument and IDocumentPartitioner for partitioning and 
IPresentationReconciler for syntax highlighting. This will help you understand 
the relationship between the serveral scanners.</WithStack>

*** Bug 30177 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Yes, the decorators do appear in the Navigator.
This is a thread safety issue with the fast resource visitor.  Investigating.
Fixed.  The problem was that the initialization of the fast visitor tree was not
thread safe.  There is a small critical region in DeltaDataTree.copyCompleteSubtree

We now acquire the workspace lock (WorkManager.checkIn()/checkOut() while the
visitor tree is being initialized.  This will create slightly more contention
for the workspace lock, but is necessary to ensure we are thread safe.  The
performance hit is minimal assuming there is no contention for the workspace lock.</WithStack>

Can something similar to be done for any file that can be found in work space.
This could be a very usefull feature, for anybody who have a large number of
file in the workspace (in my case we are talking about more that 30k number).

1) Define a runtime-workbench launch config that has dulicate plugins (same
plugin in workspace and in external location).
2) Launch this configuration
3) When the warning dialog comes up about duplicate plugins, hit cancel.

Observe: the runtime workbench process still exists in the debug view.  It can't
be terminated or removed.
Re-assigning to JDT debug to get Darin's input:
If the user launches a runtime workbench configuration contains duplicate plug-
ins, PDE indicates that to the user through a warning dialog.  If the user 
presses Cancel on that dialog, PDE terminates the launch using launch.terminate
().  
The launch terminates fine if the launch was originated from the launch 
configuration dialog.  If the launch had been originated through a shortcut, 
we run into the problem that John outlined, i.e. the launch effectively 
terminates, but you will still see it in the debug view as active(without 
threads) and you cannot explicitly remove it or terminate it.

Does the launch.terminate() have different behaviors depending on how the 
launch originated?
Can also be reproduced if there is a syntax error in a plugin.xml file and, 
when prompted, you hit cancel.
In the WorkbenchLaunchConfigurationDelegate.launch, for duplicates or for 
failed validation etc., instead of terminating the launch (which does nothing 
as no processes or debug targets have been created yet) you should set the 
monitor to be cancelled and return (the user has cancelled the launch). As 
well, the launch configuration code will not waste time setting up the source 
lookup.

I have changed to clean up like when the launch originates from the launch 
configuration dialog.  That is to remove the launch if it has no children.
Darin, please verify my changes to LaunchConfiguration.

Wassim, things will work as is but I would recommend making the changes 
described in WorkspaceLaunchConfigurationDelegate.
I'm not sure I agree with the changes... If a launch delegate were to populate 
a launch asynchronously (i.e. had a non-blocking launch method), the launch we 
be removed quiently without the delegate's knowledge.
I beleive a safer fix is for the PDE launcher simply to set the launch as 
cancelled in the progress monitor.
Ok I rolled back the changes, but don't we have that same possibility that pre-
existed in the LaunchConfigurationDialog.launchWithProgress?
AT my end, replacing launch.terminate() with monitor.setCanceled(true) seems 
to produce the desired behavior.
Fixed up in LaunchConfigurationsDialog to not remove launches that are 
asynchronously adding children to the launch.

Please verify (DarinW).
note that these changes rely on PDE updating to use the monitor.setCanceled
(true) for the stale launches to be removed.
These changes will be in the next integration build.

cancelled in the progress monitor.
Ok I rolled back the changes, but don't we have that same possibility that pre-
existed in the LaunchConfigurationDialog.launchWithProgress?
AT my end, replacing launch.terminate() with monitor.setCanceled(true) seems 
to produce the desired behavior.
Fixed up in LaunchConfigurationsDialog to not remove launches that are 
asynchronously adding children to the launch.

Please verify (DarinW).
note that these changes rely on PDE updating to use the monitor.setCanceled
(true) for the stale launches to be removed.
These changes will be in the next integration build.

    <WithStack>When attempting to use the Remote debug feature with weblogic 7.0, I select to 
attach to the server started in debug mode, and I get an error message from 
Eclipse stating that there is not any line number information in the compiled 
code.
This happened while using M4 version of eclipse.
I have also specfied in the properties to set line number info in compiled code.
In which code does the debugger claim the line info is missing? I.e. the 
compiler only puts debug info into your source files, not into existing binary 
libraries.
e-mail from Joe Daughtery:

The exact messages is as follows:
&lt;BEGIN&gt;
Attempting to install a breakpoint in the type
com.sss.swes.ClassName that has no line number
attributes.  The breakpoint cannot be installed. 
Class files must be generated with the line number
attributes.
Reason:
Absent Line Number Information
&lt;END&gt;

Also, the name of the Error Window which this error is
displayed in is "Java Breakpoint".

You are simply compiling the class files? there is no byte code modification 
going on while the class is loaded? (See similar bug 28040).
e-mail from Joe Daughtery:

Bug 28040 is exactly what is happening.  Has there
been any resolution to this problem?  If not, I will
go back to using M3.

    <WithStack>I'd like to see an additional (optional) error/warning generated by the 
compiler when switch/case is used in a dangerous way, that is, when case parts 
are not terminated by a break or return statement. While there will surely be 
lots of "old school" C-type hackers that happily make use of this "feature", I 
consider it bad style and error-prone. My experience is that it's usually a 
bug. And since it's so hard to find it, because everything compiles fine, it 
would be nice to have the compiler enforce a better programming style by 
issuing a warning here. If you do support this, please consider that the 
following case with multiple case labels for the same code still needs to work:

switch(..) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    ...
}
Nice to have. Will reconsider post 2.1
If we report these, we should also consider allowing them if there is a comment 
which explicitely states the fall through scenario.

case 1:
   ...
   // fallthrough
case 2:
   ...

Any comment would do the trick.
*** Bug 43481 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
In 1.5 mode, these warnings should be suppressible by a
@SuppressWarnings("fallthrough ") annotation.
Time permitting, but likely beyond 3.1
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

    <WithStack>The CVS commit dialog's new ability to remind me of files that are not in CVS 
yet is a nice idea, but marking all these files as "to be added" by default is 
a bit dangerous. I think it's more secure to mark none of these file by 
default, so that no garbage makes it into CVS once I press "OK" too quickly.
This is a hotly debated topic :)

I understand your argument and actually that was my position too.  On the other 
hand, there are so many facilities for filtering out ignored resources that by 
the time you get to this dialog you probably only have left resources you would 
want to add.  Basically, people found they were erring in the other direction, 
and forgetting to add resources to version control.

If you feel strongly about this please reopen, although unless really strong 
arguments are made I suspect we'll end up leaving it as is.  We typically don't 
have un-ignored resources that aren't added to version control, but maybe your 
usage is different.

Btw, I would prefer *not* to make the default configurable.
Closing this bug since we have a lot open and aren't planning on changing the 
behaviour (not because I didn't think your argument had value :&gt; ).

Ok, here we go:

Argument 1: The default dialog options should always be the ones that result in 
least damage. A variation of the principle of least surprise.

- Stuff that doesn't make it into CVS although it should might be a problem or 
may even be annoying, but it can be corrected with a simple second commit.

- Stuff that has made it into CVS although it shouldn't, is a greater pain, 
because it will also flood the machines of all other project participants on 
their next update. Ok, you can correct even that by deleting resources from 
CVS. But in the case of using something like SourceForge, once the wrong file 
(say, a password file) has made it into the public CVS by mistake, you never 
have a chance to really correct this problem, because the SF policy assures 
that your stuff stays open source (in the CVS attic, if nowhere else) until 
armageddon. For me, this is reason enough to not want "put everything into CVS" 
as the default.

Argument 2: The world is full of stupid people that actually produce the 
problem described in argument 1. Or, expressed a bit more diplomatic: It occurs 
that you have to work on projects with other people that might not have the 
same experience with or insight into Eclipse or CVS management as yourself. 
These people tend to press OK buttons because they expect that it will do no 
harm, especially if there are no explicit warnings. The current dialog behavior 
makes it much too easy for these folks to flood my disk with temporary files, 
note files, backups, unpacked documentation etc.

Argument 3: Yes, I tend to have lots of (temporary and other) files in some of 
my projects that I want neither in CVS nor in .cvsignore (because the files are 
not always the same ones, so .cvsignore would become bigger and bigger over 
time). It happens that these files appear when running certain kinds of Ant 
tasks or when executing the application under development, although I must 
admit that maybe my way of dealing with the workspace is "non standard" here. 
But I'm used to it.

Argument 4: Filtering doesn't always help. In particular since I want all the 
files to appear in the tasks list to remind me of things to clean up. But I 
don't want them to go into CVS by default.

Simple suggestion: How about giving users a chance to turn the whole new 
feature off in the preferences, so that the commit dialog resembles the 2.1 
one? That would be perfectly fine for me, and it should be easy to implement as 
well.

Btw: Count the latter suggestion as +1 for at least two people, because an 
Eclipse-using friend of mine who's too lazy to write his own bug reports 
totally agrees with me in that point. Trust me. :-)

We have made recent changes in this area. Could you let us know what build your 
using so we know we're talking about the same thing. (i.e. in the latest 
integration build, if the user commits with unadded resources in the selection, 
they are prompted twice: once to add unadded resource and once for the commit. 
Before that the dialog hade the comment and unadded resources in the same 
dialog and before that the unadded resources were skipped). 

I agree with Kevin that a preference is not the best solution. I would propose 
the following. If a user has unadded resources when they commit, they are first 
prompted with the statement/question something like "you have unadded resources 
in the selection. Would you like to add and commit them?". Their choices would 
be to add them (Yes), skip them (No), Cancel or select files individually 
(Details). This is similar to what we had in 2.0 for commiting from the sync 
view with the added ability to select files individually.
I am currently using M4, but could give one of the integration builds a shot, 
if you think I should. Yet, the additional dialog you mentioned doesn't make 
much of a difference, in my opinion. It's still a second button I have to press 
when committing, and the choice between YES and NO is not so far away from 
SELECT ALL and DESELECT ALL -- there's still plenty of room for pressing the 
wrong button. The latter in particular if you are in a hurry and have to 
quickly commit things that are needed by someone else (which seems to be true 
most of the time, in my case).

Also, as I wrote, I usually have files in my workspace that are neither under 
CVS control nor in .cvsignore, so I'd always see this dialog. I'd prefer to 
explicitly add files to CVS before I press commit. Maybe it's because I'm used 
to that from command line CVS for quite a while now.

Question: Even if you support the dialog you mentioned, why is it so hard to 
have an additional option "Prompt for new files on commit" in the CVS settings 
that, when turned off, results in the same commit behavior as in 2.0.x? I have 
no problem with this option being turned on by default, so that new Eclipse 
users have some kind of assistance when using CVS. To make it clear: I am not 
talking about a preference for choosing between "SELECT ALL" or "SELECT NONE" 
by default, the preference should decide whether Eclipse reminds me of files to 
add to CVS at all (during commit, that is, the tasks should stay as they are, 
of course).

&gt;&gt;Btw: Count the latter suggestion as +1 for at least two people, because an 
&gt;&gt;Eclipse-using friend of mine who's too lazy to write his own bug reports 
&gt;&gt;totally agrees with me in that point. Trust me. :-)

People who are too lazy to submit bug reports don't get a vote :)

Thanks for the notes.  We have discussed but this may not be addressed until 
post 2.1 (due to time constraints and bug load).
This bug has not been touched for 2 years. Closing as WONTFIX. Please reopen if 
you feel this is still an important issue.</WithStack>

Do not intend to NLS content assist files.
Talking with Kevin Haaland, we need to internalized the anttasks_1.6.0.xml file.
Specifically the content assist descriptions that are presented to the user.
My $0.002 -&gt; Don't externalize strings that the code from apache.ant gives 
you. The right place for this work to be done is in the Apache project. If you 
can demonstrate that these strings are extracted from apache and you are 
simply reusing them and by extension, if Apache were to externalize their code 
eclipse would also benefit. I'd defer this defect again for 3.0

calling delete (programatically or pressing del (same code)) on 'blue'
wipes out all the code that is commented out and leaves you with:

class A {
	int g;
	
}
I guess the source range is incorrect.
In fact this is the way the source range is computed for a DOMNode. The end of a
node is the end - 1 of its enclosing node if there is no next sibling. This is
your case here.
Changing this can lead to a problem because the comment contents won't be part
of any DOM node which is against the way they are specified. They need to cover
the whole unit.
I don't know if we want to change this that late in the game.
Current behavior seems useless. I would vote to improve for 2.1 (if doable).
Changing this can have an impact on all end positions. We might want to defer
the resolution of this PR when we will use DOM/AST for all operations.
Ok by me. Too dangerous for 2.1
Defer
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>To reproduce:

1. Create a TestCase that looks like:
---------
package test;

import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class DummyTest extends TestCase {
   public DummyTest(String name) {
      super(name);
   }

   public static Test suite() {

      return suite;
   }
   
   public void testDummy() {
      fail("Not yet implemented.");
   }
}
---------

2. With it selected, click on {The Running Man}-&gt;Run As-&gt;JUnit Test
3. In the JUnit Test Results view, click on the "Hierarchy" tab.
4. Double click on "The Dummy Test".  You should get a message box saying
     Test class not found in project
5. Double click on the failed test "testDummy" -- you should have the editor 
   containing DummyTest open up.
6. Remove testDummy.  Rerun test.
7. Double click on the "warning" (that there are no tests found in DummyTest).
   You should get the same message box saying "Test class not found in project."
Adam can you pls investigate
no probs
cannot reproduce 4
can reproduce 7
Clicking on "The Dummy Test" opens up the test case in step 4?  It's still not 
working for me on I20020218  (Win2k, JDK 1.4.1_01)
sorry, i need to recheck on junit 3.8 - i think i missed that (obviously 
crucial) part
yup, reproduced both on 3.8

the remove test runner does not communicate with the client too well in this 
case
'remote', that is
i don't think wwe can fix this for 2.1 

the problem is in the clent-server protocol, which we don't want to touch at 
this point

here's what the test runned sends to the client (for the test suite node):
"%TSTTREEThe Dummy Test,true,1"
there's no way the client can do anything useful with this info

the problem is that TestSuite.toString changes in 3.8 and it can now be 
something different that Object.toString()

so i think no 2.1 action for the suite node

as for the warning node - this is sent from the remote runner:
%TSTTREEwarning(junit.framework.TestSuite$1),false,1

again, client cannot do anything with it (there's no reference to the TestDummy 
class)

back to Erich - suggest deferring for now
agreed no action for 2.1
Erich, Adam -- will there be any action on this bug for 3.0, or is it too late
in the game?  Tx. :-)
we should look into this one - reopening
the protocol could improved for when the constructor TestSuite(final Class 
theClass) is used. However, this requires additional API on TestSuite in JUnit.

Have to defer since it depends on a new version of JUnit

    <WithStack>If I open a Java perspective and then Navigate | Go to | Resource, not all files
are visible only those that are under the java source directory.
If I open a navigator view or perspective, all files are seen.

Should the the goto resource should be the same.
No, Goto resource is an action that takes you to a specific resource in either 
the package explorer or the navigator depending on which of these two views 
have the focus when activating the action. Since the package explorer shows 
less resources as the navigator the dialog contains less elements.

Please note that with M5 the package explorer will show simple projects as 
well. So you get almost the same dialog. Only generated class files are missing 
since thay aren't visible in the package explorer either.
Let mee see if read it correctly. The resource navigator should find all things
visible in the package explorer. If this is true, then this is still a bug.

The resource navigator from package explorer sees resources only from the java
source directories. It also sees the .classpath and .project files. But it does
note see anything else. If I have files in the project that I can see from the
package explorer, can't find them in the goto resource.
No the go to resource actions are specific for the Navigator or the package 
explorer. Internally these are two different classes. If you give the resource 
navigator focus and open the go to resource dialog the dialog should show you 
all resources accessable in the Navigator. Analogous if you open the dialog 
with an package explorer in focus you should see all resources accessable 
through the package explorer. 

What puzzles me a little bit is your statement: "The resource navigator from 
package explorer". What do you mean by this ?

Navigate Resource example

I include here an snapshot for my confusion. 
The focus is on the "Package Explorer" and goto: Navigate -&gt; Goto -&gt; Resource.
That is what I mean by "The resource navigator from package explorer".

The list shows only resources under "src/java", but it does not show resources
from the "etc/services" directory (empty.html, sample-request.xml, text.txt). 

If Package Explorer sees them, why Goto Resource does not ?
No I get it. We are changing the implementation for M5 and I will make sure 
that the case is handled properly.
Thanks for your patience.
Thank You
I will take this oportunity to express my gratitude for the whole Eclipse team.
Great job, and thank you for listening to us.

    <WithStack>I am using the linked folder mechanism in latest builds (integration builds on 
1/15 and 1/22, as well as M4), and am seeing my CVS directory contents removed 
for my linked folders.

This is perhaps hard to reproduce.  It doesn't happen on initial project 
refresh, but perhaps subsequent project refresh?  Not sure.

What I have is a directory structure like this:

   /myproject/src  &lt;- real sources
   /myproject/common &lt;- linked folder

Common points to a directory structure on my filesystem that was checked out 
using CVS command line tools.  Soon after I setup this project structure, the 
CVS directories in this tree that contain Entries, Root, etc., are removed.  
They are completely gone!  The files themselves are still there, but it's like 
CVS was not the tool that checked out these dirs!

I also tried the following:


   /myproject/src  &lt;- real sources
   /myproject/common &lt;- real folder
   /myproject/common/src1 &lt;- linked folder (W2K "junction")
   /myproject/common/src2 &lt;- linked folder (W2K "junction")

With the same results.

This happens on three separate systems; one is NT, two are W2K.
What do you mean by "the directories are gone but the files are still there". 
Do you mean that the CVS folders do not appear in Eclipse but they still exist 
in the file system. If so, then this is expected behavior (The Eclipse CVS 
client always hides CVS directories that contained CVS meta information). If 
not, please reopen with a more concise description of the problem.

FYI: if you add linked resources to a CVS project, these resources will be 
ignored even if they are also mapped to CVS. If you want to use Eclipse CVS 
operations on a linked folder, you would also have to import this folder as a 
project into Eclipse.
To your question, 

  "Do you mean that the CVS folders do not appear in Eclipse but they still 
exist in the file system. If so, then this is expected behavior"

Yes, I understand that.  What I actually mean is, that the CVS directories *are 
removed from the file system*.

Here's an exact case:

 1 /Source
 2 /Source/CVS
 3 /Source/SomeProject
 4 /Source/SomeProject/CVS
 5 /Source/SomeProject/com
 6 /Source/SomeProject/com/CVS

If I link /Source/SomeProject as an external folder to an eclipse project, and 
then I do a refresh, directories 4 and 6 listed above *are removed* by the 
refresh.  They never show up in Eclipse, which is (agreed) expected behavior, 
and preferable.  However, if I go to those directories and want to commit them 
using an external tool, I can no longer cvs dif, cvs up, cvs etc....

While I understand the need to use the built-in CVS integration of Eclipse, 
with our source structure there are over 200 separate projects, and I want to 
bring in about 40 of them.  We have a master working directory on all our 
developer's machines that we keep fairly well synced to our common repository 
using CVS command line tools or WinCVS.  I wish to create an Eclipse project 
that has a primary source directory, and then links to several others 
in /Source/WHATEVER_I_NEED_THAT_DAY.   Those directories in /Source map 
directly to the CVS repository.

Why does the refresh need to delete files it has no business deleting?  The CVS 
directories should be sacred.

The files shouldn't be removed from the file system. We will investigate.
I have committed the fix for this but want to leave it open for now so I can 
run some addition tests.

As an aside, are you sure you want to connect common source folders to the 
projects that use them using the linked resource mechanism. This will cause the 
source to be built in each project in which it is linked. It would seem to me a 
better approach to load the common source as a separate project and reference 
it from any other dependant projects. This way, the common source only gets 
built once. Is there soemthing that prevents you from doing this?
You bring up a good point.  I had originally attempted to do this with M4, 
which was really my first experience with Eclipse.  I had really waited with 
bated breath for the updated project structure features, with exclusions, 
because of well-documented limitations of the Eclipse project facility pre-2.1.

When I did this with M4, debugging became a problem in that breakpoints in 
my "common" project would not find sources when debugging a project that 
depended on the "common" project.  I'll revisit this, as you are potentially 
correct that that would be the best way.

I still have the issue of needing 24 or so projects, then, because of the way 
our sources are laid out.  Not ideal.

Thanks for the pointer.

What I have is a directory structure like this:

   /myproject/src  &lt;- real sources
   /myproject/common &lt;- linked folder

Common points to a directory structure on my filesystem that was checked out 
using CVS command line tools.  Soon after I setup this project structure, the 
CVS directories in this tree that contain Entries, Root, etc., are removed.  
They are completely gone!  The files themselves are still there, but it's like 
CVS was not the tool that checked out these dirs!

I also tried the following:


   /myproject/src  &lt;- real sources
   /myproject/common &lt;- real folder
   /myproject/common/src1 &lt;- linked folder (W2K "junction")
   /myproject/common/src2 &lt;- linked folder (W2K "junction")

With the same results.

This happens on three separate systems; one is NT, two are W2K.
What do you mean by "the directories are gone but the files are still there". 
Do you mean that the CVS folders do not appear in Eclipse but they still exist 
in the file system. If so, then this is expected behavior (The Eclipse CVS 
client always hides CVS directories that contained CVS meta information). If 
not, please reopen with a more concise description of the problem.

FYI: if you add linked resources to a CVS project, these resources will be 
ignored even if they are also mapped to CVS. If you want to use Eclipse CVS 
operations on a linked folder, you would also have to import this folder as a 
project into Eclipse.
To your question, 

  "Do you mean that the CVS folders do not appear in Eclipse but they still 
exist in the file system. If so, then this is expected behavior"

Yes, I understand that.  What I actually mean is, that the CVS directories *are 
removed from the file system*.

Here's an exact case:

 1 /Source
 2 /Source/CVS
 3 /Source/SomeProject
 4 /Source/SomeProject/CVS
 5 /Source/SomeProject/com
 6 /Source/SomeProject/com/CVS

If I link /Source/SomeProject as an external folder to an eclipse project, and 
then I do a refresh, directories 4 and 6 listed above *are removed* by the 
refresh.  They never show up in Eclipse, which is (agreed) expected behavior, 
and preferable.  However, if I go to those directories and want to commit them 
using an external tool, I can no longer cvs dif, cvs up, cvs etc....

While I understand the need to use the built-in CVS integration of Eclipse, 
with our source structure there are over 200 separate projects, and I want to 
bring in about 40 of them.  We have a master working directory on all our 
developer's machines that we keep fairly well synced to our common repository 
using CVS command line tools or WinCVS.  I wish to create an Eclipse project 
that has a primary source directory, and then links to several others 
in /Source/WHATEVER_I_NEED_THAT_DAY.   Those directories in /Source map 
directly to the CVS repository.

Why does the refresh need to delete files it has no business deleting?  The CVS 
directories should be sacred.

The files shouldn't be removed from the file system. We will investigate.
I have committed the fix for this but want to leave it open for now so I can 
run some addition tests.

As an aside, are you sure you want to connect common source folders to the 
projects that use them using the linked resource mechanism. This will cause the 
source to be built in each project in which it is linked. It would seem to me a 
better approach to load the common source as a separate project and reference 
it from any other dependant projects. This way, the common source only gets 
built once. Is there soemthing that prevents you from doing this?
You bring up a good point.  I had originally attempted to do this with M4, 
which was really my first experience with Eclipse.  I had really waited with 
bated breath for the updated project structure features, with exclusions, 
because of well-documented limitations of the Eclipse project facility pre-2.1.

When I did this with M4, debugging became a problem in that breakpoints in 
my "common" project would not find sources when debugging a project that 
depended on the "common" project.  I'll revisit this, as you are potentially 
correct that that would be the best way.

I still have the issue of needing 24 or so projects, then, because of the way 
our sources are laid out.  Not ideal.

Thanks for the pointer.

    <WithStack>Since 2.1 M4, auto-indentation in the JDT editor appears to have broken.

I desire hard tabs to be 8, but indentation to be 4. I had it working this
way prior to M4, but now auto-indentation is 8.

Perhaps this is a repeat of bug 28454, but it isn't clear. The preference 
settings for tabs and indentation are confusing.

I have the "Displayed tab width" preference set to 8 (from 
Java/Editor/Appearance preference page).

In the Code Formatter/Style preference, I have "Indentation represented by a 
tab" unchecked and "Number of spaces representing a tab" set to 4.

Therefore, I expect auto-indentation to be 4, while hard tabs are 8.
If I am misunderstanding the preference settings, could someone explain how I 
can get the desired behavior restored for M4?

If the comment history is to be preserved across runs, which would be great, I 
suggest that the commit dialog have a "Delete" and "Delete All" button in 
order to remove comments from the history. Since the commit dialog is now 
resizable, the comment history could be in a list box instead of a drop down 
which would make the UI a little easier to use.

I haven't seen it in other Windows applications. Perhaps they add a blank item

I have to mark this WONTFIX.  First of all, it's operating system behavior.  
When a combo box has items, you pull it down and you click somewhere else, 
that click is thrown away so users expect to lose the click.

On my Windows XP box, the combo drops down and shows an empty list.  Not sure 
why yours and VI's is different.  Anyways, I experimented with detecting 
the "empty combo pull down case" and the only way to work around the list 
click is to hide the list.  This isn't a problem on VI's or your machine

closes, thus taunting the user - "There might be something interesting in this

    <WithStack>This used to work before 2.1.M4.

I have an ant build.xml used to invoke Sun's JAXB XJC source code generator.
The build.xml does the following:
1. Delete the directory, let's call it "D" (and its subdirectories) where the 
source is to be generated.
2. Invoke JAXB's XJC which creates .java files in the directory "D" and a 
subdir.

I invoked ant from the command prompt from the directory "D". 
I then did a Refresh in eclipse of "D", which recompiles everything. Good.
I then did a Team/Commit to CVS. Great.

This no longer works!

I get all sorts of error messages from eclipse first about CVS/Entries not 
being there, then about not being able to make a connection. This is very bad 
news for me.

If I try to do a Team/Replace With Latest from Repository, I do NOT get back 
the previous version from CVS. So I am stuck.
I have tried the following in M4 (I assume you're using M4 since you said it 
worked before then):

1) Made a project with a few nested directories
2) exited eclipse
3) deleted the CVS folders from the directories
4) started Eclipse

Here are my findings:

- I get the error about the missing CVS/Entries file if I do not perform a 
refresh before trying to commit (which I would expect since they were there 
before they were deleted in the file system). After the refresh I do not get 
this error. We should try to have a more helpful error message.

- I get the error about the missing connection when I try to commit from the 
Navigator. It is caused by a bug in the add to version control logic. 

Syncing and performing an "Override and Commit" (instead of using Commit from 
the navigator) worked for me. Does it work for you?

Also, you say that Replace With Latest doesn't work? Can you give more details 
about the nature of the failure?
Fix has been released. One remaining issue is deleting a CVS folder in a parent 
while leaving one in a child.
I have opend bug 30322 to deal with the remaining issue.</WithStack>

Syncing and performing an "Override and Commit" (instead of using Commit from 
the navigator) worked for me. Does it work for you?

Also, you say that Replace With Latest doesn't work? Can you give more details 
about the nature of the failure?
Fix has been released. One remaining issue is deleting a CVS folder in a parent 
while leaving one in a child.
I have opend bug 30322 to deal with the remaining issue.</WithOutStack>
