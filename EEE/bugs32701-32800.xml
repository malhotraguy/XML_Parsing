    <WithStack>Using RC1, when the member type is private or static, the disassembler doesn't
show it in the modifiers output.
We need to check if the class is an inner class and gets its modifiers from the
inner info attribute.
Fixed and released in 2.1 stream.
Verified on the JDT/core side, but the UI should create a ClassFileReader with 
this flag on IClassFileReader.CLASSFILE_ATTRIBUTES in order to see the "actual" 
modifiers. If the inner info is not read, then the actual modifier is unknown.
Verified.

    <WithStack>I was confused as to how to see branches in the repo view. Basically the user
expands the branches category and doesn't see anything, what next? It took me a
while to figure out that I had to select an action on the repo to see branches.

Minimally an action *must* be added to the branch category.

    <WithStack>The current code-assist allows a single word to be selected and then a
psuedo-macro run to insert some behaviour (such as 'print out variable')
using the 'selected_word' variable in
Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Editor -&gt; Templates

"Print out expression"

System.out.println("${selected_word}");

However, this fails if the selection consists of more than one line.

Instead, it would be advantageous to allow multiple-line selects to take place
which would allow templates such as

"Generate if"

if (${test}${cursor}) {
  ${selected_text}
}

Whist this works for single-line values, it doesn't work for multi-line values.
If the selected_word was replaced with selected_text then it would be possible
to provide features otherwise described by bug 32082
I think you mean "more than one line" in the summary don't you?
Thanks. Changed sentence in my head whilst in the middle of writing it ...
Quick assist (ctrl-1) gives you an approximation of this capability today.  If 
you select some text, you can then type ctrl-1 to surround with your choice of 
do, for, if, try, while.
John, what version is that? I'm using 2.1RC1 and I don't have that in the
quick-assist menu; just a bunch of classes/fields/methods (usually the
publicly available static ones)

I've created the template (shown in #1) in 2.1RC1, and it works provided 
that the selected text doesn't contain a newline; if it does, the template
doesn't seem to show up at all.
I guess you work with a workspace you created with an older version than RC1. 
In this case you have to press the "Restore Defaults" button on the Templates' 
preference page. We added new templates that make use of the newly introduced 
content assist variables $word_selection and $line_selection. Those templates 
that make use of the $line_selection variable are proposed by quick assist in 
case of a multi-line selection.
Yes, this closes the suggestion that I had here. I do have an issue that
the line_selection now no longer shows up /unless/ you have multiple lines,
which requires that anything using a single line now can't be captured.

The solution, though ugly, is to have two templates for the 'if' generation;
one showing for a word_selection and the other for a line_selection.

I'll close this bug and open a new bug for this new issue.

    <WithStack>build RC1, win2k, ibm jre 1.3.1 sr2

When changing some of the Java preferences, some of them remember your history 
(when you go back into the Preferences dialog) and some don't.

For instance when you turn on "show line numbers" and then go back into the 
preferences dialog, the selection tree is collapsed. But if you turn off "show 
line numbers" and then go back in, the current selection is Java -&gt; Editor.
Remembering the last preference node is done by Platform/UI.

    <WithStack>Run an external tool (such as TextPad) in the foreground
With that tool still running, change selection in the LCD to an Ant build 
launch configuration...the dialog re-enables (sortof).

After cancelling the build in progress, the LCD is broken:
cannot change tabs, buttons show as enabled but do not respond to clicks etc.

An interesting side effect is that if you launch the textpad external tool 
again and hit cancel ALL of the tools are terminated.

    <WithStack>throw some uncaught exception in a method.  Create an exception breakpoint for for that 
exception and mark it caught only.  Debug.  Debugger still stops on the exception.  The 
inverse situation works: catch the exception and set the breakpoint to be uncaught only.
Do you a the preference to suspend on uncaught exceptions on?
test case:
Write code that throws an exception.  Make sure exception is not caught 
anywhere.  Create an exception breakpoint for the exception being thrown.  Mark 
it as 'Caught' but NOT 'Uncaught'.  Debug.  Debugger stops on exception before 
stack trace is printed to console.  This works on WinXP.
Are you running a 1.3.1 or a 1.4.1 VM?

1.3.1.  My understanding was we can't get a hold of a 1.4.1 VM for OSX for 
legal reasons.
I can no longer duplicate.  I think I must have had the 'Suspend on uncaught exception' 
pref turned on.  Closing as INVALID.</WithStack>

Search for something. Select a search result and choose 'Replace...' from the
context menu. A dialog shows up that lets you iterate the search results and
perform a replace.
The dialog does not offer a 'replace all', which makes it problemativ to use
when you have to replace e.g. 100 occurences.

What do we generate the marker on? This information is relative to a repository

1) Create a simple project
2) Add a file foo.doc
3) Edit the file externally using Word
4) Try to delete the project.

Deletion fails because foo.doc is in use.  This is expected.  However, the
details area of the error dialog repeats the message:

Could not delete: d:\eclipse\test\Foo\foo.doc
Could not delete: d:\eclipse\test\Foo\foo.doc
John, Foo is a folder name or a project name?

I can reproduce this error, but only the offending file is inside a folder (the 
number of messages I get corresponds to the file depth inside the project).
I meant: ...only *when* the offending file...
Strange, from the error message, it looks like it's just in a project.  However,
I can't reproduce this now.  Just like you, I can only reproduce the problem
when the file is inside a folder.
In the the easily reproducible case, the reason is that the DeleteVisitor is 
relying on FileSystemResourceManager#delete(File, MultiStatus) to delete files 
and directories. That method performs a best-effort deletion in the file 
system, reporting any problems deleting files and directories. But the 
DeleteVisitor also performs a best-effort deletion, and it is calling 
FileSystemStore#delete(File, MultiStatus) for the offending file and then for 
its parent, and the parent of its parent, and so on, appending the same error 
message for each level (we should be calling #delete(File) instead and 
reporting the exceptions in the DeleteVisitor).

Also, in the ResourceTree class, when a failure occurs while deleting folders, 
two status objects are being added (it should return after adding a status 
object reporting the error, since there is nothing else to do later).
Created attachment 3830
patch for core.resources

Looks like a bug.

Must select a type from a non-leaf package.
Reworked the code which does the selection and input handling.

Had to revert the code due to bug 33986. We have to reconsider this for RC3.
no action for 2.1
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

    <WithStack>Pressing tab multiple times, results in focus following all links, and then 
getting lost.  It does not come back to the first link.  It is required to use 
Sthift-tab to get the focus back to the last link.  Shift-tab works O.K., i.e. 
when focus is on the first link, pressing the combination (twice) will bring 
the focus to the last link.
Same problem on Solaris
And Linux motif.
The doit field of an traverse event is false when delivered to shell's traverse 
listener.  This is only the case when "Tab" is pressed.  When "Shift-Tab" is 
used the doit is true.  We do not change the doit, and the event gets canceled.
These are SWT bugs.  The traverse listener should not be called at all when tab 
is pressed.  I have released a workaround in help to set doit to true.
I have opened bug 33776, bug 33777, bug 33778 agains SWT regarding tab key and 
focus issues.
The SWT bug 33776 has  been fixed.  I have tested today's nightly build, and it 
appears the the workaround is no longer needed.  I will remove it from our code.</WithStack>

Reproduce:
1. Create a new Java project, and a main class that uses a non-JRE library such
as SWT:
import org.eclipse.swt.SWT;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(SWT.getPlatform());
	}
}

2. In the Project's "Java Build Path" (right-click on it and click Properties),
under the "Libraries" tab, click on "Add Variable..."

3. Select "ECLIPSE_HOME", click "Extend...", and navigate to swt.jar.

4. Click OK, OK, and run the main class as a Java Application.
I get the following:
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/swt/SWT
	at Main.main(Main.java:4)
Exception in thread "main" 


Now remove swt.jar from the classpath, and add it as an "External Jar" instead
of an extension to the variable, and rerun the App. It should work this time.

In the launch configurations, everything looks good, but when the launch is done
using the variable, swt.jar is missing from the "-classpath" option on the
command-line.

Fixed. Problem was in JDIStackFrame#updateVariables(). We were always replacing 
the 'this' variable with a new object since the receiver could have changed (we 
cache stack frames - so when hitting a breakpoint in a method, that is called 
from a loop, we could be in a different receiver). However, we only need to 
replace the 'this' variable when 'this' has actually changed.

Thus, the model was always saying that the value had not changed, since it was 
always a new object and had no previous state to compare to.

Create a project with a few file.
Select the project an rename it.
The project tree is colapsed.
This is probably caused by the fix to viewers to no longer preserve the 
expansion state on a reused item.  Since the name has changed, the underlying 
handle is not equal to the old one, so the viewer sees them as different.
The Rename action could handle this explicitly by getting/setting the expanded 
state for the element.


Package explorer would have to do the same.

Another possibility is to detect this case in the WorkbenchContentProvider.  
The delta would have to be setting the MOVED flags properly.

    <WithStack>Run an Ant build with information output
Using the Ant preferences, change the information color.
The Console still shows the old color.
Scroll the console...the new color shows for the dirtied regions.
The console viewer only listens to preference changes for the colors it knows 
about (those defined in the debug UI). The external tools plug-in would need to 
listen to these property changes, and then update all console views - 
(AbstractDebugView#getViwer().refresh()). We may need to override #refresh in 
the ConsoleViewer to do a repaint, rather than re-setting the entire docuement?
Moving to Ant.
Needs investigation.
Deferred to post 2.1
Reopening for 3.0
Fixed in the AntConsoleColorProvider.

Select a project in the navigator.
Popup menu-&gt; Move.
The dialog will open with the option "USe default location" checked and 
content in the text entry field.
Uncheck the box.

The text field content is deleted but it should not.
This is done since the default location is not a valid non-default location 
(eh?)

There are no plans for the UI team to work on this defect until higher 
priority items are addressed. 


This was fixed in the copy/paste dialog but not in the move dialog. See bug 
19458.
These should actually be the same dialogs because they are so similar.
I didn't like the way the field was cleared upon unchecking the
checkbox too (especially since that was the
only way I could see the full value of the default location when it was
truncated (no hover help shows the full value and couldn't resize the 
dialog larger)) and found the following message confusing when unchecked and 
then rechecked the "Use default location" check box:  Invalid location path.
When the project is already in the default (workspace) location you have to 
enter a non-workspace location. That's why the ok button is disabled when the 
dialog is first shown with the "use default location" check box checked. See 
bug 22366.
Reassigning to Nick since he is taking ownership of Navigator
This is addressed by a patch to bug 224997.

When the move project comes up the default is not checked, and the name is populated with the default location.   The text is never cleared regardless of turning on and off the default location.
Tod, this has been verified in build I20080502-0100 that the text is properly preserved.  You can close this as a dup against bug 224997 since that provided the patch for this.

    <WithStack>While stepping through code in the Debug Perspective, I cannot set breakpoints 
in any code that I don't have a local copy of.  I can step into the code, but 
the Java editor does not have a left hand gutter in which I can set a 
breakpoint.  

Other maybe useful information:

I previous versions (2.0.2 I think) I was able to do this.  The Java editor for 
these files used to have "0101" as an icon instead of a "J".  Now the icon is 
a "J" just like normal source files (except the left gutter is now missing).
This was never supported

    <WithStack>It would be nice to just format the current line.  This way you could push
something like &lt;CTRL&gt;+TAB and have it automatically indent the current line
instead of re-formatting the entire file.
This is probably a dupe of bug 8583
TabNavigator is a plugin that provides this
http://zclipse.org/projects/tabnavigator/
Bug 8583 is just about indentation and not code formatting. If this feature
request is just about indentation then it is bug 8583 and can be closed as
duplicate. Or do you also want to code format the line?

Internal note:
About the stack trace in bug 32532
Tree.destroyItem clears up the list of items [1] and later destroys the OS item [2]. 
In between we turn off the drawing. For some reason, this WM_SETREDRAW off 
caused a wmNotify trying to access the list of items[] previously cleaned. This 
causes the NPE.

I have a reproducible test case with the following NPE:
In this case, the wmNotifyChild is generated after the OS tree item has been 
created and before the list of items been assigned the newly created item.

The New Plug-in Project page has a description that looks good. As soon as I 
start entering the project name, the description is replaced by "Plugin name 
must be specified". I then start typing "c" and the description appears again. 
As I type "com." (trying to type com.example.xyz), the description is once 
again replaced by "com. must not end in a period".
I think this is disruptiv and the errors should only appear under the 
description or when the focus is removed from the entry field.
This is how all wizards' first pages work. When the page is empty, 'Next' is 
disabled as you are supposed to enter some project name. As you start typing, 
we validate the plug-in project name and reject names that are not valid 
project names. 

This pattern is used elsewhere - PDE is not particularly guilty of it. Most of 
the text entry validators work on each keystroke, not when focus leaves the 
widget.</WithStack>

When I attempt to access the compare/patch preference page (Window-&gt;Preferences-

NegativeArraySizeException is generated.  I then go back to the Appearance

select the "Text Compare" tab the preview pane layout is unreadable.

    <WithStack>Steps:
1. open java perspective
2. create a new class
3. add a new field int i to the class
4. right click on the new added field i, select source-&gt;generate getter and
setter
5. click ok on generate getter and setter window
6. check the code to see what is generated.
If you conpare the result from zh_TW locale to other locales,
you will notice that for other locales, what is generated is: getI
(); and setI(int i);
But in zh_TW locale, the getI() becames "Chinese get CHAR"I(); and the
setI(int i) changed into
"Chinese set CHAR"I(int i);

Due to fact that some internal labels are translated, the getI and setI are 
changed into particular characters.  
This bug was first introduced as PMR43977. The following file has key lines 
that should not be translated.  There should be a comment or something to mark 
that the following lines are not to be translated.

In the file codegenerationmessages.properties at 
eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.ui_2.0.2
\jdt_jar\org\eclipse\jdt\internal\corext\codemanipulation

NameProposer.getterPrefix=get
NameProposer.queryPrefix=is
NameProposer.setterPrefix=set
This problem was logged against translation of 2.0.2. However, after analysing
the problem, we realized that strings which should not be externalized for
translation had been put into file codegenerationmessages.properties of
directory eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.ui_2.0.2
\jdt_jar\org\eclipse\jdt\internal\corext\codemanipulation
Please ensure that the 3 keywords are being removed from the .properties file
for eclipse 2.1 so that the translation centers will not make a mistake of
translating them.  
NameProposer.getterPrefix=get
NameProposer.queryPrefix=is
NameProposer.setterPrefix=set

If we remove this from the properties file JDT/UI will always suggest setter and 
getters of the form: setValue, getValue. If the field identifier is not written in English 
but in German you will get setWert and getWert which is funny as well. 
The NamePropser class is no longer in use in JDT/UI. Removed keys form JDT/UI 
land. 

Moving to JDT/Core since they are now doing name proposing. 
David - pls verify that these strings are indeed externalized.
Actually, these Strings should NOT be externalized as per original request.
Currently these Strings are not externalized.

    <WithStack>I'm not sure if this is a GUI threading problem, or if this is a refresh
problem...  I have a medium sized project (approx 5000 files, including .jar and
a few other binaries) that for some reason keeps "locking up" the GUI during a
"refresh."  I can go into each of the folders within the project and "refresh"
with no errors, but if I try to "refresh" the entire project, I have the
following symptoms:  Progress shows recompilation of the entire project, then
during the "in progress..." portion (approx. 60% of the way through), the GUI
stops functioning and will not repaint, the CPU goes to 100% utilization, and a
ps -ef shows about 10 threads tied to Eclipse.  Two of the threads (I am
assuming the main thread and a gui thread) each vie for approx 50% cpu
utilization.  The only way to stop it is to kill the GUI or the main thread
associated with Eclipse.  The log file shows the following paste:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.resources 4 274 Feb 24, 2003 12:56:04.757
!MESSAGE Resource is out of sync with the file system: /cosmos/CVS/Entries.

I know for a fact that Eclipse is out of sync with CVS, I added some files
locally using gCVS, and I am trying to synchronize Eclipse to the repository. 
But, Eclipse is forcing me to do a "refresh" first.

    <WithOutStack>I'm not sure if this is a GUI threading problem, or if this is a refresh
problem...  I have a medium sized project (approx 5000 files, including .jar and
a few other binaries) that for some reason keeps "locking up" the GUI during a
"refresh."  I can go into each of the folders within the project and "refresh"
with no errors, but if I try to "refresh" the entire project, I have the
following symptoms:  Progress shows recompilation of the entire project, then
during the "in progress..." portion (approx. 60% of the way through), the GUI
stops functioning and will not repaint, the CPU goes to 100% utilization, and a
ps -ef shows about 10 threads tied to Eclipse.  Two of the threads (I am
assuming the main thread and a gui thread) each vie for approx 50% cpu
utilization.  The only way to stop it is to kill the GUI or the main thread
associated with Eclipse.  The log file shows the following paste:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 274 Feb 24, 2003 12:56:04.755

    <WithStack>I never receive notice of a CheckStateChangedEvent for my CheckboxTableViewer
control.  The API docs say that there is "no effect if an identical listener is
already registered", but I did not register another listener, so if there is
one, how did it get registered?  Or more specifically, how can I find out when a
checkbox inside a CheckboxTableViewer has been selected?

Source Example 

This is a test case inside of a Launch Configuration tab.  The necessary XML
for plugin.xml is commented out at the top of the source code.
In your example, you are directly creating SWT items in the widget used by the 
viewer.  This is crossing levels of abstraction.  When using JFace viewers, 
you should not generally manipulate the SWT control directly, except for 
layout.

Viewers are model-based adapters to SWT widgets.

You need:
- your domain model (should not depend on SWT or JFace code)
- a viewer of your choice to show the model
- a content provider that maps between the model and the viewer
  - it provides the initial content of the model to the viewer;
  - it also tracks changes in the model, and updates the viewer accordingly
- a label provider that provides labels (text and image) for elements in the 
model
- optionally a sorter
- optionally one or more filters
- optionally various listeners (selection changed listener, check state 
listener, etc)

Once the viewer is all set up,
- use viewer.setInput to tell the viewer about your model
- the viewer then tells the content provider about the input, allowing it to 
hook any listeners on the model, and gets the initial list of elements to show
- the viewer passes the elements through the filters and sorter as necessary, 
and creates the necessary items
- when the model changes, the content provider is notified via the listener it 
hooked, and should update the viewer using add/remove/update/refresh on the 
viewer

Fixed up TestLaunchApplicationTabGroup.java 

This configures a content provider, label provider, sorter, and sets the input
to be a model.	In this case, the model is an unchanging array of model
elements.  The model elements are two-element arrays mimicking a property
object.  The content provider is an ArrayContentProvider, which handles the
common case where the model is a static array.	The label provider just takes
the strings out of the array.  The sorter sorts based on the first item in the
array (the property name).
Not a bug in the viewers.  With the attached changes, the check state listener 
is now called.  

FYI, the reason it wasn't working is that, internally, viewers use setData() 
on the SWT items to remember the corresponding model element.  Since you 
created the SWT items yourself, they did not have the model element set.  
CheckBoxTreeViewer.handleSelect does a null check and does not fire the event 
if getData() returns null.

Note that viewer listeners like selection listeners and check state listeners 
are always in terms of model elements, not SWT widgets, preserving the 
abstraction.


Wow, I did not know all of this.  Thanks so much for your help.

Run command from help scenario SA, multiple times (from 3 consoles).
1 would start standalone (display help or not due to timeout)
2 would display help
3 would display help

Run command to shutdown standalone.  The program in console 1 would exit and 
return to prompt.
Commands in console 2 and 3 keep running.

Looking at processes it shows me 2 eclipses and 4 javas running.  This is very 
bad.  It looks like the lock mechanism did not work. Command in consoles 2 and 
3, launched Eclipse before displaying Help.
There is no nice work around to shut down these instances of eclipse.  Since 
they all share the metadata, the .connection file is overwritten and there is 
no way to find out port used by instances launched earlier.
If port is passed when launching, only the first one will be closed, and the 
others are not since they cannot listen on the already used port.
Eclipse and its workspace were not on the local har disk, but on the network.  
That could have impact on speed and locking of files.
Same behavior on Solaris (second call to display help does not exit).  When 
testingon Solaris, Eclipse was running of a local drive.
The problem was .lock file that only works on Windows.  See bug 25342 agains 
core.

Since on non Windows platform the file can be deleted, our code was launching 
new help system (that is supposed not to return to command line), instead of 
just asking the already running instance to display help.

I released a fix for non windows platforms to try to establish HTTP connection 
to the already running eclipse, instead of trying deletion of a .lock file.  In 
Eclipse 2.2, this code should be replaced with creating real file lock using 
Java 1.4 APIs.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>* Place a method breakpoint on a method that is entered many times
* Configure to suspend on both method entry &amp; exit
* Add a hit count to the breakponit (say 3)

-&gt; The breakpoint suspends on the third entry and third exit, and every third 
entry/exit after that. Normally a hit count only suspends the breakpoint once. 
To be consistent, the breakpoint should only stop on the 3rh entry &amp; exit.
Nothing planned for 2.1 - not a common use case.
Consider for 3.0
The internal model appears to be hosed badly. Jared helped explain this to me,
but it looks like the MethodBreakpoint uses some trickery to implement the hit
count. Either a LineBreakpoint or a MethodEntryBreakpoint is used, depeneding on
wether it is possible to optimize (Use a LineBreakpoint if there is a line) for
the entry. The problem is that when setting both entry and exit breakpoints with
a hit count, the code does not handle disabling the second request after the
first request has satisfied the hit count. As a result, the break point is
re-enabled every time it's hit.

A work-around patch is to check to see if the breakpoint has expired when we
handle the event, but this doesn't really fix the underlying model. I'll send
the patch to Jared and he can decide if we should apply the patch in the mean
time, of if we need to wait until the model is fixed. This is over my head for a
"working-at-home" day, as Jared warned :-)

Proposed work-around patch
The other thing that Jared and I discussed was wether it was a bug that the UI
didn't show the breakpoint as enabled after the hit count was reached and the
method entry point was hit. Now, I am not sure if this wrong, since the
breakpoint should get disabled after the hit count is reached and the breakpoint
hit. This is what happens with the work-around patch that I've attached to this

Open the external tools launher dialog.
Delete all configurarions.
Select Program.
Resize the dialog making it small.
Click new.
The dialog will be resized to show the context of the new configuration but 
will not be big enough to show the check box and the note under Argments.
This is a general problem with the launch config dialog. It's not specific
to External Tools. Moving to Debug.
Joe, also consider this problem when fixing bug 32335 (I think it's the same 
issue).

    <WithStack>* Create a watch point configured for both access/modification
* add a hit count of 1
* the breakpoint stops on the first mod (in my case)
* the breakpoint renders as disabled
* the breakpoint stops on the first access 
* no more stops

Since the breakpoint is still configured to suspend on a the access after the 
first modification, it should not render as disabled until after the first 
access (in my case).

Like entry/exit breakpoints, hit counts are not intuitive with these 
breakpoints. It is not clear what the expected behavior is - i.e. is the hit 
count per access (entry) and per mod (exit), or both?

Typed in wrong field.... re-opening
Nothing planned for 2.1 - not a common use case.
Consider for 3.0
Looking at this I'm not sure what a hit count means in the case of a mod/access 
watchpoint. Do we suspend on the total of (mod + access = hit count) or when 
(mod = hit count) or (access = hitcount). My feeling is the later - i.e. on the 
3rd access and 3rd modification. Opinions?
We create 2 event requests, so the VM sends an event after the Nth access and an
 event after the Nth modification.

This is minor:
If I create 2 actionSet elements, PDE calls them actionSet1 and actionSet2.
After I delete them both, and create another one, PDE calls it actionsSet3, 
even though 1 and 2 are not there anymore.
These are just temporary names that you are supposed to immediately change. We 
could try to recycle numbers that are not used any more, but it is not worth 
the expense.</WithStack>

Check the attached screen-shot. There are lots of empty space in that dialog.
Created attachment 3680
Dialog screen-shot
The space is required for variables that provide a variable component to 
further specify the variable.
Select ${resource_loc} for example.
It could do that same as the preference pages and wizards. If you select a 
page that requires more space the dialog is resized.

This is related to bug 32762 - we have too much empty space, yet not enough

If you select a link on the about dialog the web browser will fail to open.
Probably related to bug 29356 
The code in ProductInfoDialog#openWebBrowser, which is a hack for linux, does 
not consider the Mac case.  As per the comments the ultimate solution is to 
move the help framework down and then remove that method. In the meantime I was 
going to modify the code to check the swtplatform, and then make the 
appropriate guesses (from the help framework) to find the 'correct' web browser.
A good way to open an URL in an already running (or to launch a new) web browser is 
by executing "/usr/bin/open http://www.eclipse.org"
It uses the user's default browser (configured in the MacOS X Internet pref panel).
/usr/bin/open fails if the file to be displayed is not a URL, for example an 
html file, which is invoked if the 'more info' button is pressed.  The two 
strings passed to open were as follows when I first followed a link, and then 
pressed the 'more info' button.

On AIX, the package is initially empty and the error appears at the top of the

with "com.example.xyz".
Dejan,
When Platform UI took over the schemas, the "class" attribute for &lt;action&gt; in 
the actionSets extension was made optional.  So when the user creates an 
&lt;action&gt; in the gui pages, PDE no longer assigns a default class name to 
the "class" attribute, as it is now optional.  Therefore, when you launch the 
new attribute class wizard, the package field is not primed with anything, and 
no class name is shown.
Please modify the test case to reflect the new behavior.
True - class is now optional. I changed the script to stop implying that some 
values will be preset.</WithStack>

My host and target program were running on the IBM1.4 VM

Cannot reproduce the resizing problme on Linux-GTK. The resource selection area
expands to fill the dialog if I resize it.

Does Windows disallow resizing of the launch config dialog or is (was?) the
table just not resizing to fill the dialog?
This from clicking on the Variables button on the Ant launch configuration 
main tab...not on the refresh tab.  The "Select Variable" dialog is not 
resizeable.
I changed the height hint in the resource component to make it tall enough
to show 8 tree items (just felt like a good value) and made the dialog
resizable. Please verify, DarinS.

4) Click Yes.

-&gt; Another out of sync error message with prompt to overwrite.

5) Click Yes.

-&gt; Finally you get the correct error message, that the .project file is now invalid.

What is happening: whenever there is a CoreException on save, the editor
framework checks the file timestamp, and compares it to a cached timestamp.  If
the times are different, it reports the failure as an out of sync error.  In
this case, we've successfully written the file, but want to warn the user that
the file is now in an invalid state.  The fact that the time stamp has been
updated does not mean the file is now out of sync.  The text framework should
use IResource.isSynchronized rather than caching and checking the timestamp itself.
The raised issue is valid. However, investigation shows that we cannot change 
the document providers as they are API since 1.0 and thus the conceptual model 
they implement.

There seems also to be a related core issue: Throwing this kind of exception 
during IFile.setContents implies that the operation failed. I interpret this 
as that the content of the file has not been changed. However, what happens is 
that the operation was successful but that the new content violates the 
consistence rules. The exception should be thrown before the contents is 
changed and not after the fact.

Moving to Platfrom Core.
Closing.  Text team cannot fix, and we don't plan changing behaviour of setContents.

We should consider tracking resource selection the way external tools tracks

two into a single mechanism?). Also, we should improve the quality of the
error message. The message should give the user a hint about what they need
to do to fix the problem - in this case, they need to select a resource.
The message should say something like "Launch failed: No file with a main
type selected"
Propose to improve error message, but not to change selection handling for 2.1
Improved error message - it's one of

"The active editor does not contain a main type"

or

"The selection does not contain a main type"
Please verify, Jared.
NOTE: the selection handling has been improved in the debug platform - when 
there is no active editor, or no selection, launch shortcuts are not enabled. 
However, since the launch shortcuts are extension points, the action itself 
cannot do any enabling based on the selection (and if we added it, it would 
break the lazy-load rules).

Generally, mneumonics work by simply pressing the underlined key to jump to the
associated widget in the shell.  The "Keys" preference page does not work this
way.  It requires you to hold down the "Alt" key before using any mneumonics to
jump between groups.  This is different from all the other preference pages in
Eclipse.

i asked nick and tod about this - it seems to be correct as far as they are 
concerned. can you check it again? come show me the problem if you think it 
still exists.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If you hover over any icon in the shortcut bar, it appears that the text
displayed is a concatenation of two words, which causes a problem in some
languages.  Specifically, there are two cases:

In Brazilian Portuguese, "xxx Perspectiva" is displayed instead of "Perspectiva
xxx", which does not make sense in Brazilian Portuguese.  There is no way to
enter the correct text.

In Simplified Chinese, there is a space between the title and the word
"Perspective" which does not make sense in Simplified Chinese.  There is no way
to get rid of the extra space.

Should use a message format instead of concatenation.
We already do use a message format here.  This looks like a translation error.

Preferences-&gt;Ant
The sentence: "Enter the names of the build files to find if using Run As-&gt;Ant 
Build and the selected resource is not Ant build file."

It seems that there is something missing in this sentence.
The sentence is accurate but I agree that it is hard to decipher.

If the user select a resource that is not an XML file and chooses Run As-&gt;Ant
Build, we will search through the file hierarchy (upwards, I believe) searching
for a build file. This preference allows the user to specify what file names to
look for during this search.

This feature was implemented upon user request. It emulates the behavior of
"ant -find" from the command line.

Suggestions for improving the description are welcome. :)
Here are two options:

Enter the names of the build files to find when using Run As &gt; Ant Build if 
the selection is not Ant build file.

Enter the names of the build files to find if the selection is not an Ant 
build file when using Run As &gt; Ant Build.

Question: Can't we get all *.xml file and file out which ones are Ant Build 
files? So we could delete this preference?

&gt;&gt;Can't we get all *.xml file and file out which ones are Ant Build 
&gt;&gt;files? So we could delete this preference?
This was too expensive during the current stream (we only received fast xml 
parsing late in the game).  The preference would still be needed to emulate 
the -find of command line ant. You can specify the name of the build file to 
find.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Reworked the description...used Eduardo's suggestions tied in with the 
description of -find from Apache Ant.

Please verify DarinW.
I found the first line confusing, and adjusted it. I suggest we put the 
information about search ordering (i.e. from the selection, up towards the 
root), into the help file. (But I don't think we have a help file for Ant/Ext 
Tools yet).
See adjustments
Please verify, Darin (S).
One more slight modification.

Generally, mneumonics work by simply pressing the underlined key to jump to the
associated widget in the shell.  The "Keys" preference page does not work this
way.  It requires you to hold down the "Alt" key before using any mneumonics to
jump between groups.  This is different from all the other preference pages in
Eclipse.
Sorry, bugzilla crashed while submitting bug 32777 so I didn't think it had
suceeded.  Closing.

    <WithStack>If a project description file has the following:

   abc

the carriage returns, tabs, extra spaces, etc. will all be part of the name.  
We need to trim extra whitespace off the string before setting it in the 
project description.

Check all other fields which use character data too.
See ProjectDescriptionReader.endElement().
Should also consider which other fields should be trimmed when being read from 
the file. (referenced projects, builders, natures, etc)
In ProjectDescriptorReader, all data read via the 'characters' method will be 
prone to this problem.  Since characters() only appends character data to a 
StringBuffer called charBuffer, all uses of charBuffer must be examined.

Project names must not begin or end with a whitespace (this is enforced by
workspace.validateName) but what about other values in the project description?
I believe that most other values are allowed to have trailing whitespace...is
this true?

Excellent, thanks Martin.  I've been trying to track this down for awhile.  The
important feature in the steps was that the folder contained files.  It didn't
matter if it was a java project.  So, exact steps are:

1) Create a simple project 'xxx'
2) Create a linked folder 'junit' to an existing empty location
3) Add a file below the linked folder
4) Rename the linked folder
5) Copy the linked folder

-&gt; Error.

The lifecycle event for PRE_LINK_MOVE was not being fired.  This resulted in the
AliasManager's location table having a stale location for the old link.  Since
this stale location overlapped the location of the moved resource, it caused a
failure during refresh of aliases when the moved link was modified.

Fixed by adding the lifecycle event in Resource.move.  Regression test added to
BasicAliasTest.</WithStack>

I cannot change the labelAttribute to 'name'.
After I enter name and switch to another properties cell the name gets cleared.
Same onn AIX.  Additionally, after typing "name", the status bar displays:
"name" is not a valid attribute name.
Actually, I noticed that if all the attributes are entered (including the name 
attributes) it is then possible to change labelAttribute.
Yes. This is the script error - you are now not allowed to set the label 
attribute to an invalid attribute name. So you must define attributes first, 
then pick one to be used for visual representation of the element (for label 
provider).

    <WithStack>Please bring it back.  The current width of the tab is to small to guess the 
name of the class.  I myself normally set it to medium prior to it being 
removed on RC1.
Bug #31564 removed this functionality from the preference pages, the underlying 
code is still there.

Users can access EditorList and TabCompression via the file 
plugin_customization.ini in 
&lt;eclipse_install_directory&gt;/plugins/org.eclipse.platform_2.1.0

For example add the following two lines to have the pulldown active, and the 
tabs not compress:
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/EDITORLIST_PULLDOWN_ACTIVE=true
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/EDITOR_TAB_WIDTH=20

Values for compression were: high=3, medium=6, low=9, none=30

The EditorList view can also be restored by editting the plugin.xml of 
org.eclipse.ui, uncomment the EditorView entry.

There are no plans for the UI team to work on this defect until higher 
priority items are addressed. 
The workaround described here by Andrew Irvine appears to have been disabled in 
M6.  Is there an update to this workaround?
This was not intentionally removed in M6, we will investigate what happened.
Created attachment 13297
Image Showing Previous Behaviour

This image shows Eclipse 2.1.3, with Andrew's plug-in customization lines. 
This seems very similar to our current mechanism, but without the ability to
affect the amount of compression.
Created attachment 13298
Image Showing Current Behaviour

Again, with Andrew's plug-in customization lines, but notice that it has no
effect.  We still compress the tab text up to some hard-coded internal limit,
at which point we display the drop-down.

I'm assuming that, at this point, it would be sufficient to provide some way of
controlling that compression value.
*** Bug 56787 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bug 56787 has a patch to change this behaviour. 
Patch committed to CVS, and should appear in I200409200800 and later. 
 
Now, you can control this behaviour with a customization line such as the 
following: 
EDITOR_MINIMUM_CHARACTERS=80 
 
The value is the minimum number of characters to display in the tab of the 
editor.  Setting this value to some arbitrarily large value (e.g., 10000), will 
ensure no compression.  Setting this value to -1 is the same as not setting it 
at all.  The normal default value is 10. 
Is this an API preference (in org.eclipse.ui's pref store and defined in
IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants), or an internal one?
This preference is defined in IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants, and initialized in 
UIPreferenceInitializer. 
This does not work in I200409212000. 
The problem is a bogus line for comparing the default and the actual preference 
value.  It's silly, and I don't know what possessed me to put it there. 
 
I have a patch.... 
Created attachment 14707
Patch to "org.eclipse.ui.workbench"

Removes lines related to comparing the default and actual value, as
plugin_customization.ini sets the default value.
Patch reviewed by Kim and Billy, and applied to CVS.  This should appear in 
I200409230010 and later. 
Verified in I200409230010, GTK+ 2.4.9, KDE 3.3.0, Linux 2.6.8.1.  Oh, and there 
is a mistake in comment #9.  The line should read: 
 
    org.eclipse.ui/EDITOR_MINIMUM_CHARACTERS=80

For example add the following two lines to have the pulldown active, and the 
tabs not compress:
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/EDITORLIST_PULLDOWN_ACTIVE=true
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/EDITOR_TAB_WIDTH=20

Values for compression were: high=3, medium=6, low=9, none=30

The EditorList view can also be restored by editting the plugin.xml of 
org.eclipse.ui, uncomment the EditorView entry.

There are no plans for the UI team to work on this defect until higher 
priority items are addressed. 
The workaround described here by Andrew Irvine appears to have been disabled in 
M6.  Is there an update to this workaround?
This was not intentionally removed in M6, we will investigate what happened.

Image Showing Previous Behaviour

This image shows Eclipse 2.1.3, with Andrew's plug-in customization lines. 
This seems very similar to our current mechanism, but without the ability to
affect the amount of compression.
Created attachment 13298
Image Showing Current Behaviour

Again, with Andrew's plug-in customization lines, but notice that it has no
effect.  We still compress the tab text up to some hard-coded internal limit,
at which point we display the drop-down.

I'm assuming that, at this point, it would be sufficient to provide some way of
controlling that compression value.
*** Bug 56787 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bug 56787 has a patch to change this behaviour. 
Patch committed to CVS, and should appear in I200409200800 and later. 
 
Now, you can control this behaviour with a customization line such as the 
following: 
EDITOR_MINIMUM_CHARACTERS=80 
 
The value is the minimum number of characters to display in the tab of the 
editor.  Setting this value to some arbitrarily large value (e.g., 10000), will 
ensure no compression.  Setting this value to -1 is the same as not setting it 
at all.  The normal default value is 10. 
Is this an API preference (in org.eclipse.ui's pref store and defined in
IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants), or an internal one?
This preference is defined in IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants, and initialized in 
UIPreferenceInitializer. 
This does not work in I200409212000. 
The problem is a bogus line for comparing the default and the actual preference 
value.  It's silly, and I don't know what possessed me to put it there. 
 
I have a patch.... 
Created attachment 14707
Patch to "org.eclipse.ui.workbench"

Removes lines related to comparing the default and actual value, as
plugin_customization.ini sets the default value.
Patch reviewed by Kim and Billy, and applied to CVS.  This should appear in 
I200409230010 and later. 
Verified in I200409230010, GTK+ 2.4.9, KDE 3.3.0, Linux 2.6.8.1.  Oh, and there 
is a mistake in comment #9.  The line should read: 
 
    org.eclipse.ui/EDITOR_MINIMUM_CHARACTERS=80

Sometimes the hover text for a breakpoint will appear for a breakpoint in an editor ruler, 
but usually it does not.
Debug just sets the tooltip text and leaves it - moving to SWT for comment.

Note that the editor ruler is not a native widget but uses a subclass of 
Canvas.
Is this still a problem in latest (HEAD)? I cannot reproduce it.
I will test and let you know...

Search for "$nl$" results in 11 documents.
All of these documents, except for the second one, show false positives, as 
they match "nl" instead of "$nl$".
This includes the document which returned with a 100% accuracy.
Search for "nl" yields the exact same results as "$nl$", which leads me to 
believe that $ is being treated as punctuation.
This happens for both quoted and uquoted search queries (stemmed and exact 
search).  English analyzer only returns letters, and exact analyzers ignores 
everything that is not letter or digit.
Removing punctuation should be done as a preference settings, as in most cases 
users are not concerned with punctuation or special characters.
Marking this as enhancement.
In plenty of programming languages, @, #, and $ are identifiers - not 
punctuation. The user should be able to search for parameter names, system 
macros, etc. that include these.

Users should also be able to search 'punctuation' that appears as part of 
filenames/paths: '.', ':', '/', etc. For example, in Eclipse, I might want to 
look for help about the workspace metadata .log file - but searching for this 
just gives me help pages that contain the word 'log', 'dialog', etc. (yes, I 
do realize that you can include just about any character in a filename/path - 
especially on Unix).

Similarly, you'll find 'punctuation' in command line parameters/runtime 
options. In the Eclipse help, searching for '-data' nets me a bunch of hits 
containing the word 'data' - but the page I would likely have preferred 
(Eclipse runtime options - the one that actually contains the string, -data) 
is low in the list of search hits.

I could go on... but I hope I've made my point. There are many legitimate 
reasons for needing to include these characters in a search term. Search 
should consider any non-null character valid. This should not be considered an 
enhancement request - this should be considered a high-priority bug.
I'm just wondering if anything can be done to reconsider the status of this 
bug. I've already explained why I believe it should not be considered P3 or an 
enhancement - but it concerns me that this still shows a target of 2.1. In 
*many* cases, what you are referring to as 'punctuation' are not punctuation 
at all - they are identifiers, parameters, options, etc. that should be 
considered valid search elements.
Jennifer,
The target is not 2.1, it is not set to anything.  2.1 is the Eclipse version 
in which the problem is initially discovered.
Considering other Help and Eclipse bugs at P3 priority, I believe this 
functionality is at most P3.  The bus is perfectly valid.

This behavior appears when using out of a box Eclipse.  Your product can 
override this by contributing a different text analyzer that will preserve 
characters you need when tokenizing text.  See 
org.eclipse.help.base.luceneAnalyzer extension point.
Marking as P4 - unlikely to be looked at for 3.1.

Kai, can you take a quick look at this?
This works for me in the latest code. Is it possible that Christof submitted
a fix for this since Feb 24?
The problem I consistently see is that the cursor jumps to the start of the

Christof, care to comment? :)
I am pretty sure that Christof has left the building...
This is a problem of the redraw==false state in the TextViewer. As you have 
tagged it RC3, I assume two component leads have approved it. So, I'll 
borrow :) one of the voices and will release the fix for RC3.

    <WithStack>I am creating a jar using an existing manifest file that has “Class-Path:” setting.

The jar file created by the Jar Packager is missing Class-Path in the manifest file.
Daniel, please comment.
This is probably caused by an invalid manifest files. The manifest in the JAR is
generated by the manifest writer from the used SDK i.e. it reads your file,
validates it and uses all entries which are valid. If the input file does not
follow the JAR manifest spec (e.g. missing newlines) then the corresponding
entries are removed.</WithStack>
