    <WithStack>20030317 just crashed with out of memory error
ok, i tried restarting,  as i always did before 
but my workspace is now corrupted - i cannot restart

i will attach log files
Created attachment 4203
log before it happened
Created attachment 4204
log i get now when i try restarting
i was able to sort of recover by:
- deleting the .snap file
then, eclipse came up again, but workspace was empty

i imported my source projects back from the fikle system and connected them 
back to cvs
(some stuff is still broken but at least i recovered my work)

still a blocker, though, i think

It makes no difference whether i explicitly install the junit and jface and 
ui.workbench plug-ins or not.
this one may get the reward for most often filed bug

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 34169 ***</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I've installed the Windows RC2 version of the eclipse platform (Version: 2.1.0 
Build id: 200303071024) and i can't create a testcase or a setsuite using that 
version.

Here's what i did.

install RC2 Windows version
unzip the zipo into D:\eclipse\rc2\
start D:\eclipse\rc2\eclipse\eclipse.exe
create a new project (say: "Test")
create a new package (say: "test")
invoke package pop-up menu
select new 
select other 
select junit
select TestCase

An error dialog pops up saying that an error hase occurred and refferring to 
details in the error log

The error log contains:
Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in "org.eclipse.jface"

Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in "org.eclipse.ui.workbench"

2. compare org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/contexts_JDT.xml v20030317 with v20030318
===&gt; lots of white space changes are reported

Marking bug as critical since it is almost impossible to compare the file.
Ignore white space works OK in the compare editor.
The state of the ignore white space check is strange in the Synchronize view 
drop down. You have to toggle it twice to get the actual state in sync with the 
one shown in the view menu.

Should fix for RC3
In the scenario that worked in the compare editor I was using two Java files.

In Dani's scenario the white space difference is that in one file the tabs got 
expanded into white space.
No, if 'Ignore Whitespace' is on, tabs and spaces are treated correctly.
The real problem is that the two versions of the file in question sometimes
use the abbreviated notation &lt;tag .... /&gt; and sometimes the long notation &lt;tag&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt;.
Since the difference is at the end you can only spot it by scrolling horizontally
to the right end.

Investigating the strange toggle behavior of the "ignore Whitespace" menu item
in the sync view.
The 'ignore white space' menu action in the Synchronize view  drop down doesn't honor
the default setting from the Compare preference page.

Moving to VCM.
There is no longer an ignore whitespace in the synchronize view</WithStack>

just a heads up that there may be a major leak in there

Adam can please investigate in the leak
i cannot confirm any leak in local history

details to follow

Reason for bug:
JavaMainTab uses IWorkspaceRoot.getProject(String) to see whether a project 
exists. The implementation WorkspaceRoot.getProject(String) asserts that the 
project name consists of exactly one segment, which is not the case on an empty 
project name (0) or one with path seperators.

Proposed solution:
Use IWorkspaceRoot.findMember(string) instead.

Sorry, the copy/pasted one got a little mangled.

+1 for releasing it into RC3
Jared, please apply/evaluate patch.
The patch file is invalid. It looks like the patch was made against a file
called JavaMainTab-orig? Michael, to create a patch in Eclipse just check out
the file you want to edit, make the edit, and choose "Team-&gt;Create patch" from
the context menu. This will create a patch that diffs the file in your
workspace against the file in the repository.

The changes look good, though, and I've applied them by hand.
After I apply these changes, the original problem (an exception that occurs
when we validate the Project field) goes away. However, another exception
appears from the classpath page.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the dialog and change a config's project to "Grah/blah"
2. With this patch, we correctly display an error stating that the project
doesn't exist.
3. Click on a different config. When asked to save, click No. The following
exception occurs:

Anytime you enter a project name with a slash and we ask the JavaModel for a
project with that name, we get the InvalidArgumentException because 
JavaModel.getJavaProject(String) makes the same call to
IWorkspaceRoot.getProject(String) that was causing the problem in our UI.
The same bug exists in the 2.0 product. There is a deeper problem here in that 
the getProject(name) methods return a handle to a project which may/may not 
exist - but the methods also (undocumented) will not accept a name with more 
than one segment. 

This means all clients that call the method would have to verify that the name 
is valid. 

The simplest fix would be to disallow slashes in the "project name" field in 
the launch config tab. However, I believe that since the same problem existed 
in 2.0, this bug is not critical.

Not planning to fix for RC3. Marking as later.

(Erich, do you agree?).

mess for the user if they happen to hit it.

    <WithStack>Every time a JavaBreakpoint attribute is set, 
IJavaBreakpointListener.breakpointInstalled() gets called for that breakpoint.
There is no call to IJavaBreakpointListener.breakpointRemoved() before 
additional calls to breakpointInstalled().
This is a change in behaviour from Eclipse 2.1.

We have debug adapters that use hidden Java breakpoints.  They use 
IJavaBreakpointListeners to keep track of whether the hidden Java breakpoint is 
installed in any VMs so that the breakpoint icon will have the checkmark on it 
if it is installed (similar to Java breakpoints).
Due to the new behaviour, we will have to add code to all our debug adapters to 
do an additional check whenever breakpointInstalled() is called to see if we 
have already been told about this breakpoint being installed in a particular 
debug target.
It would seem like a better solution if JDT only called breakpointInstalled() 
when the breakpoint is first installed in the VM, like what happened in Eclipse 
2.0.
CC'ing EG for RC3 approval.
Darin can you confirm that this is a change in behaviour?
There is a change in behavior. In 2.0, we only re-created the underlying JDI 
request when the breakpoint changed in a way that required the request to be re-
created. In 2.1, we always re-create the request whenever a breakpoint 
attribute changes. This causes the "install" notification to be re-sent when 
the new request is created.

However, in 2.0, more than one notification would be generated if a breakpoint 
were installed, and then a property were changed that requires the underlying 
request to be recreated (such as a change in hit count).

The change is that we are creating more "double" notifications in 2.1 than 2.0.
+1
Fixed. Added a cache of installed targets to JavaBreakpoint. A target is added 
on the first "install notification" and removed when the breakpoint is removed 
from the target. Install notifications are only sent when not already installed.

Added JavaBreakpointListenerTests.

Assigning to Luc &amp; Jared for double verify.

For the Ctrl + C case, the event is coming in but the character is not "C" 
or "c" but the ascii value 3 which maps to "^C".

For the ALT + C case, the Alt key down comes in but not the second event.

Here is a simple test case:

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display display = new Display();
	Shell shell = new Shell(display);
	shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
	final Text text = new Text(shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.MULTI);
	text.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
		public void keyPressed(KeyEvent event) {
			String mask = "";
			if ((event.stateMask &amp; SWT.CTRL) != 0) mask 
+= "SWT.CTRL ";
			if ((event.stateMask &amp; SWT.SHIFT) != 0) mask 
+= "SWT.SHIFT ";
			if ((event.stateMask &amp; SWT.ALT) != 0) mask 
+= "SWT.ALT ";
			if ((event.stateMask &amp; SWT.COMMAND) != 0) mask 
+= "SWT.COMMAND ";
				
			System.out.println
(mask+" "+event.character+" "+event.keyCode);
                        System.out.println(Integer.toHexString
(event.character));

		}
	});
	shell.setSize(200, 200);
	shell.open();
	while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch()) {
			display.sleep();
		}
	}
}
The character field represents the final character value after all modifier 
keys have been applied.  For example, the character is 'A' when Shift+'a' is 
typed.  When Ctrl+'a' is typed, the character is ^A (ASCII 0x01 sometimes 
called SOH).  In the case of Alt, this modifier does not affect the character 
value.
Please address the ALT key problem.

The ALT key problem only occurs if there is no menubar in the application.

Subject: [SWT] R2.1: Only KeyUp event for Alt+[Shift]+&lt;char&gt; on Windows
Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2003 11:26:42 -0500
Organization: EclipseCorner

In R2.1 Alt+&lt;char&gt; and Alt+Shift+&lt;char&gt; key combinations do *not* 
generate a KeyDown event on Windows, unlike all the other keys.  That 
means that I have to put listeners on both KeyDown and KeyUp in order to 
capture all the keys.

That would be fine, but it makes it very difficult to ignore the KeyUp 
events which correspond to the preceding KeyDowns that I have already 
processed (the down &amp; the up events are not always 100% identical in 
their keyCode, character, and stateMask - e.g., press Shift, press A, 
release Shift, release A).  Is there any easy way out of this??
Fixed &gt; 20030331
Note that this only happens when there is no menu bar in a shell.  If you are 
seeing another case, please reopen this PR with a snippet that shows the 
problem.  Thanks.
Hmmm, my problem is with an editor view inside Eclipse - which certainly does
have a menu bar!?  In any case, I'll try a later build too, which should have
your fix.
Your key is being eaten by an Eclipse accelerator.  Try a simple stand alone 
example with a menu bar to prove that this is true.
I'll try soon with the fixed driver.  Please note, however, that it's not one
key that I do not get - I get *no* Alt+&lt;char&gt; or Alt+Shift+&lt;char&gt; keys at all!
I've opened bug 36450 - the fix provided still doesn't solve the problem in a
widget of a workbench text editor.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>KeyListener understand the SHIFT as stateMask but not the CTRL and the ALT 
(c.f. the example below)

                    //                    channelText.append("SHIFT+C");

I cannot reproduce this in the 0317 integration build by opening the 
preferences dialog and running through all of the pages.  Does it happen for 
you consistently?  And with the 0317 integration build?

I have not seen it on the latest integration builds either.  I do have the 
workspace/environment saved where I can reproduce it if you desire.  

I have no problem with closing this one.
I've verified in the current stream that this native is there and is being 
invoked successfully, so closing.

    <WithStack>In Eclipse 2.0.* versions, we had enabled full drag-n-drop cabability between 
our viewers.  Recently we moved to Eclipse 2.1, however, the drag-n-drop fails 
to initialize.  We add drag adapters like so to our viewer:

int dndOperations = DND.DROP_COPY | DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_LINK;
Transfer[] transfers = new Transfer[] {LocalSelectionTransfer.getInstance()};
viewer.addDragSupport(dndOperations, transfers, new AClass(viewer));

AClass above would be a subclass of DragSourceAdapter.  The above code work, 
and the Drag is enabled for objects of type 'AClass'.  However, if I attempt 
to add another DragSourceAdapter for type 'BClass', this is where the problem 
comes in.

For example, 
int dndOperations = DND.DROP_COPY | DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_LINK;
Transfer[] transfers = new Transfer[] {LocalSelectionTransfer.getInstance()};
viewer.addDragSupport(dndOperations, transfers, new BClass(viewer));

It seems any time I attempt to add a second DragSourceAdapter, the 
initialization fails with with the following exception.

If there is something which has changed with respect to Drag-n-drop 
initialization, please pass along.

It is not possible to create multiple drag source objects on the same 
control.  

On some platforms, this results in a segmentation fault and on other 
platforms, the result is not clear - which drag source will actually provide 
the data when requested (will the second one be ignored or will it replace the 
first one, on no platform will both drag source suppliers be available)?  As a 
result, in 2.1 we added an exception so that the application would be advised 
that this functionality is not supported.

We will add something to the README to make this change clear.
VI to update "API changes docuement" (whatever is was called) we did with Jeem 
to include this information or put the information in the appropriate place.
Jim already has the info for the API document.
I also need to update the javadoc to reflect this information.
Ok, I can react to this in my code.  However, if it is not possible to add 
multiple drag source adapters to a viewer, why not have the API as singleton, 
ie. 'setDragSupport' as opposed to 'addDragSupport'?  thx. Murray 
SWT does not own the Viewer code.  This question needs to be redirected to the 
JFace team.  Adding Nick Edgar to this bug report for his comment on the 
Viewer API.
Well, addDragSupport was added in 1.0 before we were aware of the limitation 
&lt;g&gt;.  We could deprecate it and change it to setDragSupport.  I've filed bug 
35727 for this.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Attempting to install a fix to ftrA if ftrA includes ftrB_1.0.0, but 
ftrB_1.0.0.1 is installed will fail.  The system claims that 
"updated ftrA (1.0.0.1): Included feature "ftrB(1.0.0)" is older than the 
currently active feature."
However this shouldn't be disallowed.  The match statement is not "exact" so it 
should be permissable to update ftrA even when ftrB is at a higher version than 
ftrA needs.  Reversing the install order (installing ftrA's fix before ftrB's 
fix) doesn't cause a problem, and overlaying the ftrA fix doesn't cause a 
problem either.  I don't think Update Manager should stop this condition.

Note that this is *not* an update scenario.  ftrA and ftrB are being changed as 
patches (patch="true").

A standalone example is being emailed to Dejan.

Basic install:
'master_1.0.0' includes 'ftrA_1.0.0'
'ftrA_1.0.0' includes 'ftrB_1.0.0'

--- now for the fixes that might be applied:
'fix1_1.0.0' includes 'ftrA_1.0.0.1' and patches 'master_1.0.0'
'fix2_1.0.0' includes 'ftrB_1.0.0.1' and patches 'master_1.0.0'
'ftrA_1.0.0.1' includes 'ftrB_1.0.0' (ie, it doesn't know about or need fix2)

In theory, fix1 and fix2 are independent. They don't require each other and fix 
separate problems that customers may or may not choose to install.

As it is the only workaround is to have fix2 prereq fix1 so that we force 
people who want fix2 to install fix1 first.  This will get more complicated as 
more fixes are introduced.
When we detect that a feature is an e-fix, we check if the feature it patches 
is present, but we also check if the features it brings are newer or the same 
as the ones already present.

This is a prudent check but is too strict in its current implementation. We 
start from the e-fix root and recurse down the hierachy checking each feature. 
The recursion is important because e-fixes may include other e-fixes. However, 
once we reach non-patch children, there is no need to go deeper than immediate 
non-patch roots. 

The fix is therefore to NOT recurse any further if the parent is not an e-fix 
by itself.
The fix:

ActivityConstraints.checkUnique()

1) Create a local boolean variable 'patch' as:
   boolean patch = isPatch(ifeature);

2) At the bottom of the method, recurse only if the feature is a patch itself.

       if (patch)
	   checkUnique(ifeature, features, status);

Released into HEAD (2.1) and 2.0.3 streams.

Will keep open in case we need to ship this as an e-fix for 2.0.3 products.

Using the "Local Rename" quickfix when the editor's overwrite mode is activated 
has undesired behavior. The first key press works like normal, the second 
character overwrites at all positions where the e.g. variable was used, the 
next characters only overwrite there characters in the place where you are 
typing.
I cannot reproduce it, when this happens is the link feedback gone? Did you do 
a code assist after the first character?
I did not use code assist, just entered the characters. Feedback is partially 
gone, see screenshot.
Created attachment 4208
Stages of typing....

Four parts: Before starting (top), first character typed, second then third.
Also happens in Windows XP
The "overwrite" mode is causing problems (didn't read careful enough). 

Undo works fine.

Moving to JDT-Text for investigation
Problem is more general: linked editing has the same problem.
Addendum: In insert mode. If when doing the local rename, the cursor ends up 
the end of the identifier and I delete the next character, the next character 
is deleted at ALL linked positions. Further character deletes do not have this 
behaviour.
Works for me using R3.2 and newer.

NOTE: if you start typing beyond the linked area then of course the linked mode is exited.</WithStack>

We can say that this case is not really a problem because we can assume that

But where it becomes really problematic is when the plugin correctly compiles 
in the workspace, but the build.properties is bogus and the plugin fails to 
compile through the build.xml.
There is a problem with error reporting, which will be looked at in 3.0.

Actually Sun's problem if Eclipse is using Java's zip functionality but thought 
y'all should report it. Other zip tools (winzip, powerarchiver)don't have a 
problem with umlauts (ä,ü,ö). In eclipse gebäude is translated into geb+n[with 
a squiggly on top]ude. For us as programmers this isn't a problem because we 
never use umlauts, however the users of our product most certainly will. When 
the filenames are 'destroyed' then other tools using the files have a problem.
Closing.  It is known that Winzip and java.util.zip use different encodings. 
Unfortunately, there is no fixed specification for this, so it's a matter of
opinion which one is right (and we can't be compatible with both).

    <WithStack>Sometime (not sure exactly when) my workspace started dipslaying a window 
saying "File has been changed on the file system. Do you want to load the 
changes?" everytime I try to save my source code. If I say yes it saves it, and 
then asks the same question a second time. If I say yes again, it reverts back 
to the source before my changes. I don't know what is going on with it. I 
thought I may have inadvertantly changed a preference, but I can not find 
anything referencing it. This hasn't always been the case, as I say it sort of 
started out of the blue. The file system I am using is a mapped drive to an 
as400 if that makes any difference.
Could you by any chance be running out of space on your mapped drive (e.g. 
exceeded user's quota)? In this case, this would be a known issue (see bug 
32765).




No, I have plenty of space (about 280 gig). It does actually save with the 
first question asked. I thought maybe it had to do with system times on my pc 
vs. the system time on the mapped drive, but I tried as best I could to 
syncronize them, and it didn't seem to help.
Does this happen with all types of editors? (text editor, java editor, etc)
Which VM are you using?

UI: what are the circumstances for displaying this message? Are there any calls 
to java.io.File.getLastModified?

Moving to Platform/UI for comment.

The timestamp used to check whether the editor contents is in sync with the 
file is computed in FileDocumentProvider.computeModificationStamp(IResource).

Please reopen if you still see this in I20030930 or newer and attach the
following information:

- build ID

- does this happen with all types of editors? (text editor, java editor, etc)
- is the file under version control? If so which one?

I'm new to this Bugzilla instance, but have been experiencing the same error (described in Comment 0 and at http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/mv/tree/10875/).

I am saving files to the LOCAL HARD DRIVE, not a network store.  My code is not being automatically synched with any SVN or other repository. 

I am using:
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
Version: Helios Service Release 2
Build id: 20110218-0911

and editing Java files only.  I haven't tried with text files.

My Runtime JRE is:
Project JRE (JVM Contents (MacOS X Default))

I am using Mac OS X Snow Leopard and Java 6.  

I know this is an old bug to reopen, but it is the one that describes the issue and it's better than opening a duplicate.

I am also running Symantec Endpoint Protection (version 11.0.6100(0179)), and not able to disable it.  That shouldn't be changing the java files, but it's provided as possibly relevant information. 

Any ideas on what's causing this?

Thanks!

Many of our command descriptions have the prefix "Action to". 
We should avoid the implementation term "action" in the UI.
Where necessary, we use "command", but this is not needed here.  The 
description should be a simple statement of the command's effect.

For example, the description for File/Close is "Action to close a resource".  
It should be "Close a resource" (actually, the description could be much 
improved beyond this, but the prefix is not needed).
Kai, can I get your approval for this please?
I notice that the new JDT, Debug, Search and Compare command descriptions avoid 
this pattern.
I am willing to fix up the ones in Text as well if you like.

+1 
Appreciate your help with the descriptions of the text commands.

I also think it would be good to change the style from imperative to 
descriptive.
E.g. Use "Closes the active editor" rather than "Close the active editor".

However, this would affect all components and this would be too much swirl for 
RC3.  We should probably do this post RC3 though, since it affects only 
the .properties files.

Fixed for I20030318.
Changes reviewed by Andrew.

Kai, in addition to removing the "Action to" prefixes, I made a few corrections 
to grammar, and a few minor wording changes.  
The biggest change in your items were to Select Up and Select Down.
old:
command.selectLineDown.description = Action to select the below line of text
command.selectLineUp.description = Action to select the above line of text

new:
command.selectLineDown.description = Extend the selection to the next line of

    <WithStack>There is a boolean field 'dirty' in the class ProjectDescription and an 
associated accessor called isDirty().  This was used to do lazy writing of the 
project description to disk - i.e. check the 'dirty' bit to see if the project 
description had changed since the last save/snapshot.  This logic is not used 
anymore.  Therefore, the field 'dirty', all references to it and the related 
accessor 'isDirty()' should be removed.  Note this is not API.

the next key that matches the key passed in.  There is no need to check for a

    <WithStack>Eric, we saw a situation yesterday where we had to press DOWN key twice. Please 
check to see if groups are being selected. You should temporarily change some 
of the Logic drawers to groups instead of drawers to test multiple group 
navigation.
Is this fixed?
Changed PaletteViewerKeyHandler to not select PaletteGroups.  The only exception
is the first time the user tabs to the palette after the editor is opened, the
SliderPaletteEditPart is selected.  When the user presses the down arrow, the
group will be selected and another down arrown will place the selection on the
first item in the group (the selection tool in the logic example).  From that
point until the editor file is closed and reopened, groups will not be selected.</WithStack>

In a self-hosting workspace with the org.eclipse.ui module in source, rest in 
binary, I did a Synchronize CVS projects (all projects).
Got an error dialog saying: Cannot close connection.
Tried again and it worked.
There was nothing in the log.
The problem is that, after an exception occurs, if the close throws an 
exception, the original exception is masked. My guess is the original exception 
was a timeout. The close should be modified to throw the original exception.
This was fixed a while ago</WithStack>

- open a type in the rt.jar (e.g. java.awt.Color)
- attach source
- the editor flashes many times before it displays the source, then continues

I was able to reproduce it on Win XP.

I want to set up e to invole Sun's javap.exe. Here is what I have in the 
External Tools dialog:

Location:
C:\java\sun\1.4.1_02\bin\javap.exe
Arguments:
-verbose -c -classpath ${project_loc}/bin ${resource_name}

When I select a Type in the Java Browsing Perspective and invoke javap from e, 
I get the error: 
Class 'BasicHCTransaction.java' not found

The description for ${resource_name} is: "Expands to the name of the selected 
resource". In the context of Java Browsing I expected this to be the class 
name not the name of the underlying file.

Without better Java integration, I do not see how using Javap or other tools 
like it is possible. Perhaps Java specific Variables are needed in the 
External Tools dialog or the Java Browsing Perspective needs to override the 
meaning of the existing Variable names. I vote for new Java specific Variables 
like "java_class_name", which is backwards compatible and pretty clear.

Thank you for considering this request.

When a file is deleted from a CVS repository a revision is created and marked as
deleted. This revision cannot be restored but is still shown in the restore dialog.
I have investigated and partially implemented proof of concept for a number of 
solutions to this problem.  However, I am not sure which way to go.  Many 
judgement calls would be made.  Here is a summary:


1) Just filter out the deletion revisions:
   Pros:
     Simple implementation
     Gets rid of clutter
   Cons:
     Leaves gaps in revision numbering which may confuse users

2) Grey the text of the line for the deleted revisions.
   Pros:
   Cons:

3) Do #2 but also allow the selection of the deleted revisions *but* update 
the Wizards error area and disable the Finish button when deleted revisions 
selected.  (Can also use the grey feature of the checkbox itself)
    Pros:
      Gives explicit feedbac as to what is going on.
    Cons:

the Wizards error area and disable the Finish button when deleted revisions 
selected.  (Can also use the grey feature of the checkbox itself)
    Pros:
      Gives explicit feedbac as to what is going on.
    Cons:
      Since the user can select revisions from multiple files at once they may 
end up with multiple "errors" that need to be corrected.

Several performance improvements have been added in RC3. They releate to

    <WithStack>Problem Description:
Creating a fast view out of a Hierarchy view and then trying to open it from 
the short cut bar causes an "Unhandled exception caught in event loop. Reason:
java.lang.NullPointerException" message to be printed in the shell window that 
Eclipse was launched from. The fast view never is displayed on the workbench.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a new resource perspective and reset it.

2. Use "Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other" to open a Hierarchy view (under the Java item 
in the dialog). A hierarchy view opens.

3. Drag the hierarchy view to the shortcut bar and drop it there. A fast view 
icon for the hierarchy view will be created in the task bar.

4. Click on the hierarchy fast view icon. !BUG! The error message ""Unhandled 
exception caught in event loop. Reason: java.lang.NullPointerException" is 
displayed in the launch shell, and the view is not displayed correctly on the 
workbench screen.

Comments: the fast view icon can be removed by right clicking it and 
selecting "Close" from the context menu.

If I take the 2.1 RC2 build, start it on a new workspace and follow the steps 
provided above by Rob, I cannot reproduce it on Windows 2000. Will track down a 
Solaris box to test on that.

Meanwhile, Rob, can you verify if you start with a 2.1 RC2 build with a new 
workspace, that you can reproduce this problem. Thanks!
Verified that it occurs with a brand new workspace in RC2.
I just tried on a Solaris box. Installed a new 2.1 RC2 with new workspace. 
Start up Eclipse, open Hierarchy View (which opens on top of Task view in 
Resource perspective), d&amp;d Hierarchy view onto shortcut bar, click on Hierarchy 
view icon to make it visible. No problems. I could not reproduce the problem.

Can you give me the steps you did. Can you tell me what version of Solaris you 
are running? What vm and version you are using?
java -version

SunOS robin 5.7 Generic_106541-23 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60

Steps to reproduce are exactly as listed, except that I deleted the workspace 
directory before starting Eclipse.
I still have not been able to reproduce this problem. Rob, would you be willing 
to debug this for us given you have no problem reproducing it. You simply need 
to lauch a target eclipse in debug mode from your host eclipe (Run &gt; Debug, 
then create a new "Run-time Workbench")

The stack trace seems to indicate that PluginActionSet has a null value 
for "bars". Not sure how that can be. Either we

1) created an instance of this without calling init (doing a code search, that 
is not the case)

2) we happen to past null in the init argument (again, doing a code search, 
that is not the case)

3) dispose() was called (again, doing a code search, that should not happen)

I would setup everything and then just before showing the Hierarchy view (when 
its a fast view), place a breakpoint in ActionPresentation.setActionSets

Please let me know what you find out.
I have reproduced the problem in RC3, and using a much easier method.

1. remove any existing workspace directory, and start Eclipse

2. Use window-&gt;open perspective and choose Java

3. once the Java perspective opens, click on the "hierarchy" tab. The error 
message will appear in the launch shell window.

patched and up-to-date server).
See also bug# 35254, for a similar problem with the Hierarchy view.
SWT team was able to reproduce this problem on their Solaris box. Moving to SWT 
team to investigate why the focus change event while creating the tool item.

Doesn't seem to happen when there is any editor open.  Can you confirm this?
The behaviour is slightly different (same preparation as before, but closed 
the "Welcome" editor prior to opening the Hierarchy view). 

The first time Hierarchy fast view is clicked, there is no longer a null 
pointer exception, but the hierarchy view is not displayed properly on the 
workbench screen (there is a grey outline/border of where it should appear, but 
no content - the navigator and outline views can still be seen beneath it). 
Clicking the hierarchy fast view a second time removes this border but now also 
produces the following error message in the launch shell: Unhandled exception 
caught in event loop.
Reason:
java.lang.NullPointerException

Repeatedly clicking the hierarchy fast view toggles between the two results: 
border with invisible contents, or unhandled exception...

SN says, Kevin, can this be worked around in UI for today's build?

It's going to take us a while to find out the difference between Solaris Motif
and Linux Motif that is causing the problem.  Even when we find this out,
changing code in the area of focus at the 11th hour is not likely to happen.
No changes in UI are risky as well.Suggest lowering the priority of this defect 
to P2 and the SWT team document this bug and suggest workaround in their readme.

Also recommend that the SWT and UI teams work to find a real fix to the problem 
post 2.1. 

Rob do you agree with this resolution?

Fixing in SWT by changing setFocus is too risky.  We should make this a ReadMe 
item instead.  Since it doesn't happen if an editor is open and it does not 
result in the loss of work, it does not sound like a stop ship bug.
I will advise ASAP re. acceptability of downgrading.

Veronika and Grant, note that if an editor is open, it DOES happen. I see that 
I've misinterpreted comment #19.

To clarify: it DOES happen when an editor is open. My comment #20 refers to the 
test case wherein the editor window (i.e. the lone "Welcome" editor) is closed 
before clicking the fast view icon. Either way, a problem ensues. 
We have not been able to reproduce the error when an editor is open.  We can 
cause the error easily when all editors are closed.

If you cause the error once, this may account for continued problems later 
when an editor is open.

Please give steps to make error happen when an editor is open.
The steps I use are as follows:

1. Remove the Eclipse workspace directory

2. Launch Eclipse. Eclipse opens with the default resource view and a "Welcome" 
editor. 

3. Use "Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other" to open a Hierarchy view (under the Java item 
in the dialog). A hierarchy view opens stacked over top of the Tasks view.

4. Drag the hierarchy view to the shortcut bar and drop it there. A fast view 
icon for the hierarchy view will be created in the task bar.

5. Click on the hierarchy fast view icon. !BUG! The error message ""Unhandled 
exception caught in event loop. Reason: java.lang.NullPointerException" is 
displayed in the launch shell, and the view is not displayed correctly on the 
workbench screen.

Unless Eclipse stores state information someplace other than the workspace 
directory, I don't know how a previous error could cause repeat occurrences.
After reviewing the impact with the team here, I've lowered the priority to P2 
and impact to "major" due to loss of functionality. We would like to review the 
release note when it is ready. We believe that the problem needs to be fixed, 
but ASAP after 2.1 is released.
Veronika,

Grant and I were able to reproduce the problem on the SWT Solaris machine with 
the editor open. It happens on the host eclipse, but not on the target eclipse.
Actually I don't think it ever happened for us with an open editor.  
Regardless, I guess this isn't the interesting case since it's not consistent 
anyways.

Should readme this.
Here is the readme item that Jim wrote, which we decided not to include in the 
2.1 readme, since it turned out that this problem only occurred on an older 
version of Motif.

Certain fast views broken (Solaris Motif only)
On Solaris, creating a fast view sometime causes an internal exception when the 
fast view is opened from the short cut bar, and the fast view is not displayed 
on the workbench. The problem only seems to happen if the fast view does not 
have a control that takes focus. Examples of problematic views are an empty 
Hierarchy view and an empty Outline view. (bug 35244)
Correction: it was bug 34648 that was only seen on an older version of Motif, 
not this one.  We still decided not to reopen the RC4 candidate to add this 
readme item.


Note that it is also inaccurate for the readme to state that it is Solaris only.
As mentioned above in comment #9, this also occurs on HP-UX.

Created attachment 4340
stack trace: 1st time
Created attachment 4341
stack trace: 2nd time

"Stack" occured immediately after clicking hierarchy fast view. "stack 2" is
2nd time at breakpoint (but still only 1 original click on fast view button.
Also occurs on HP-UX 11.00, Eclipse V2.1 Build ID: 200303192032 (RC3) (fully 
patched and up-to-date server).
See also bug# 35254, for a similar problem with the Hierarchy view.
SWT team was able to reproduce this problem on their Solaris box. Moving to SWT 
team to investigate why the focus change event while creating the tool item.

Doesn't seem to happen when there is any editor open.  Can you confirm this?
The behaviour is slightly different (same preparation as before, but closed 
the "Welcome" editor prior to opening the Hierarchy view). 

The first time Hierarchy fast view is clicked, there is no longer a null 
pointer exception, but the hierarchy view is not displayed properly on the 
workbench screen (there is a grey outline/border of where it should appear, but 
no content - the navigator and outline views can still be seen beneath it). 
Clicking the hierarchy fast view a second time removes this border but now also 
produces the following error message in the launch shell: Unhandled exception 
caught in event loop.
Reason:
java.lang.NullPointerException

Repeatedly clicking the hierarchy fast view toggles between the two results: 
border with invisible contents, or unhandled exception...

SN says, Kevin, can this be worked around in UI for today's build?

It's going to take us a while to find out the difference between Solaris Motif
and Linux Motif that is causing the problem.  Even when we find this out,
changing code in the area of focus at the 11th hour is not likely to happen.
No changes in UI are risky as well.Suggest lowering the priority of this defect 
to P2 and the SWT team document this bug and suggest workaround in their readme.

Also recommend that the SWT and UI teams work to find a real fix to the problem 
post 2.1. 

Rob do you agree with this resolution?

Fixing in SWT by changing setFocus is too risky.  We should make this a ReadMe 
item instead.  Since it doesn't happen if an editor is open and it does not 
result in the loss of work, it does not sound like a stop ship bug.
I will advise ASAP re. acceptability of downgrading.

Veronika and Grant, note that if an editor is open, it DOES happen. I see that 
I've misinterpreted comment #19.

To clarify: it DOES happen when an editor is open. My comment #20 refers to the 
test case wherein the editor window (i.e. the lone "Welcome" editor) is closed 
before clicking the fast view icon. Either way, a problem ensues. 
We have not been able to reproduce the error when an editor is open.  We can 
cause the error easily when all editors are closed.

If you cause the error once, this may account for continued problems later 
when an editor is open.

Please give steps to make error happen when an editor is open.
The steps I use are as follows:

1. Remove the Eclipse workspace directory

2. Launch Eclipse. Eclipse opens with the default resource view and a "Welcome" 
editor. 

3. Use "Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other" to open a Hierarchy view (under the Java item 
in the dialog). A hierarchy view opens stacked over top of the Tasks view.

4. Drag the hierarchy view to the shortcut bar and drop it there. A fast view 
icon for the hierarchy view will be created in the task bar.

5. Click on the hierarchy fast view icon. !BUG! The error message ""Unhandled 
exception caught in event loop. Reason: java.lang.NullPointerException" is 
displayed in the launch shell, and the view is not displayed correctly on the 
workbench screen.

Unless Eclipse stores state information someplace other than the workspace 
directory, I don't know how a previous error could cause repeat occurrences.
After reviewing the impact with the team here, I've lowered the priority to P2 
and impact to "major" due to loss of functionality. We would like to review the 
release note when it is ready. We believe that the problem needs to be fixed, 
but ASAP after 2.1 is released.
Veronika,

Grant and I were able to reproduce the problem on the SWT Solaris machine with 
the editor open. It happens on the host eclipse, but not on the target eclipse.
Actually I don't think it ever happened for us with an open editor.  
Regardless, I guess this isn't the interesting case since it's not consistent 
anyways.

Should readme this.
Here is the readme item that Jim wrote, which we decided not to include in the 
2.1 readme, since it turned out that this problem only occurred on an older 
version of Motif.

Certain fast views broken (Solaris Motif only)
On Solaris, creating a fast view sometime causes an internal exception when the 
fast view is opened from the short cut bar, and the fast view is not displayed 
on the workbench. The problem only seems to happen if the fast view does not 
have a control that takes focus. Examples of problematic views are an empty 
Hierarchy view and an empty Outline view. (bug 35244)
Correction: it was bug 34648 that was only seen on an older version of Motif, 
not this one.  We still decided not to reopen the RC4 candidate to add this 
readme item.


Note that it is also inaccurate for the readme to state that it is Solaris only.
As mentioned above in comment #9, this also occurs on HP-UX.

Steps to reproduce:

- create a Java project
- add a Jar to it without putting it onto the build path (don't make it a
  java element)
- open properties-&gt;Source attachment
i think there should be another entry in the log avove that one
can you look?
the problem comes i think from JavadocConfigurationPropertyPage.getJavaElement

in the case when a CoreException is thrown and caught, that method returns 
null, which ends up in JavaDocLocations.getJavadocBaseLocation as elem
This is not a regression. The problem is that, since the jar isn't on the 
class path, it is not a Java element. Even if we make the property page work 
when selected, we can't store the enterned value since a javadoc location can 
only be attached to a Java element. 

The fix would be to present a label for jar not on the class path telling the 
user that a javadoc location can only be set for Jar's on the class path.

I tested the fix proposed by adam. But this only postpones the NPE until the 
user hits OK.


Martin pls investigate a minimal fix for RC3
Created attachment 4237
fix

Full fix of the problem. Attaching a URL to a JAR not on the classpath is
allowed as long as it is a Java project.
suggest to fix.
Fix is to be more precise in deciding which elements can have javadoc locations 
('getJavaElement'), to prevent the NPE and to hide the controls in that case.

    <WithStack>overwrite mode is really stupid :-), so I've *tried* to disable the INSERT 
keybinding that activates it.  I've removed the mapping, but the StyledText 
widget still goes into overwrite mode anyway.  I'm guessing that it is the 
widget's fault because the statusbar does not update to indicate the new mode.

    <WithStack>Creating a new folder, file, etc. with the New-&gt;wizard is painfully slow with
RC2.  I believe this was the case with RC1 as well.

It takes 5-15 seconds for what I type to appear in the text field.  It then
takes an addition 5-15 seconds for it to recongize that I it the "finish"
button.  For the dialog to complete and close then takes anywhere from 1 minute
to over 5 minutes.

In a new workdspace with a small amunt of projects, there doesn't appear to be a
problem.  However, in my normal workspace with 46 projects, it is extremely
sluggish.
Does it speed up if you turn off decorations (Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench

This was a bug in the decorators that showed up mostly in the new file dialog.

    <WithStack>Problem Description:
After opening all possible views and moving them such that there are no 
overlapping views on the workbench (stress-testing suite), I used File-&gt;Exit to 
close the workbench (investigating bug 33577). After the workbench closed, I 
noticed a message in the launch shell window saying "Unhandled exception caught 
in event loop. Reason:Widget is disposed".

Note: This differs from bug 33577 in that there is no spinning process: the 
workbench closes after saving the workspace.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Eclipse, and select any perspective.

2. Move the existing views such that there are no tabbed (stacked) views.

3. Use Window-&gt;Show Views to add all possible views (including the SWT 
Examples). Re-arrange views such that there are no tabbed/stacked views (it 
will be difficult to see the titles of some views during this process).

4. Select a new perspective, or exit Eclipse using File-&gt;Exit. The shell that 
Eclipse was launched from will display the following error message:
"Unhandled Exception caught in event loop.
 Reason:
 Widget is disposed".

Widget is disposed... log file
Rob, the stack trace indicates that you were clicking on a tab folder, rather 
than switching perspectives or shutting down.  Do you see the message when you 
switch perspectives or on shutdown, or does it appear when rearranging the 
views?

Andrew, could you please try to reproduce this?
I didn't notice the message until I had closed Eclipse, so it may have occurred 
prior to closing, while I was rearranging all the views. I used a combination 
of dragging some views by their menu bar and some by dragging their tab. I'll 
see if I can pin down more exactly what causes the message.
I saw the message while dragging a view by its title bar to a new location on 
the worbench (paned views stress test). I've attached the log file. I 
reproduced it by:

1. opening Eclipse with a brand new workspace

2. opening all possible views by selecting them from the Window-&gt;Show View 
dialog (shift-selected all of them after opening each item in the dialog tree)

3. Dragged views from stacked views to new locations such that all views are 
visible (but not necessarily big enough to be useful) with no stacking of views.

The message appeared after moving almost all the views (only 2 left stacked).

Configuration info (via Eclipse Window-&gt;About Eclipse-&gt;Configuration Details)
Rob,

The Configuration information (comment #8) does not include the exception you 
reported.  Was this from the same machine?  Did you clear the .log file?  Are 
you using a different workspace?
The log file attached via comment #6 should have the info - does it not? It is 
the content of the .metadata/.log file.

The log attached via comment #8 was after the log file had been reset and no 
error had yet occurred - I didn't realize you were looking for another example 
of the error. Let me know if the other two log files don't have the info you 
need.
No problem.  Wasn't actually looking for other examples of that error, just 
what else was going on, i.e. were there other logs generated with that one.

I do have a question about the logs I did see.  Did anything strange happen 
when you started eclipse?  I see two java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Decorations

Do you know what generated them?  If so a separate bug should be logged.  See 
bug #31956 for a bug with a possible similar trace (they did not provide an 
actual trace, just the summary).
Hmmm. I think it would be best to ignore attachment from #8. I suspect that 
some of the work I was doing this morning (running java and Eclipse in a 
debugger to try to catch the SIGSEG trap (bug #34916)) strayed into the log 
file; I know I was having java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError problems at the 
beginning until I got all the parameters worked out. I think the 
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError is a red herring, unless you saw it in the first 
two log files.
Rob,

When RC3 is delivered could you try and reproduce this bug, capturing the full 
output from the Configuration Details.  That way I can see if any other logs 
are leading up to the problem.  I have had no success in reproducing this bug 
with the I200303182359 build on HP-UX, linux or Windows.  Meanwhile I will use 
the log from comment #6 to look at the code.
I have reproduced the problem in RC3, and using a much easier method.

1. remove any existing workspace directory, and start Eclipse

2. Use window-&gt;open perspective and choose Java

3. once the Java perspective opens, click on the "hierarchy" tab. The error 
message will appear in the launch shell window.

The previous comment should be clarified to read "Problem verified to STILL BE 
OCCURRING on a fully patched and up-to-date server (HP-UX 11.00)"
Problem does NOT occur on HP-UX 11.11, or Solaris 9.
GG, didn't we fix this already?  Please confirm and close.
Yes, this is the hp-ux manifestion of bug 35774 .  To see this, do the 
following and you'll get the same trace as originally attached here:

- start a completely new eclipse workspace
- open the Java Type Hierarchy perspective
- open the Plug-in Development perspective
- switch to the opened Java Type Hierarchy perspective
- switch to the opened Plug-in Development perspective</WithStack>

what else was going on, i.e. were there other logs generated with that one.

I do have a question about the logs I did see.  Did anything strange happen 
when you started eclipse?  I see two java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Decorations

Do you know what generated them?  If so a separate bug should be logged.  See 
bug #31956 for a bug with a possible similar trace (they did not provide an 
actual trace, just the summary).
Hmmm. I think it would be best to ignore attachment from #8. I suspect that 
some of the work I was doing this morning (running java and Eclipse in a 
debugger to try to catch the SIGSEG trap (bug #34916)) strayed into the log 
file; I know I was having java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError problems at the 
beginning until I got all the parameters worked out. I think the 
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError is a red herring, unless you saw it in the first 
two log files.
Rob,

When RC3 is delivered could you try and reproduce this bug, capturing the full 
output from the Configuration Details.  That way I can see if any other logs 
are leading up to the problem.  I have had no success in reproducing this bug 
with the I200303182359 build on HP-UX, linux or Windows.  Meanwhile I will use 
the log from comment #6 to look at the code.
I have reproduced the problem in RC3, and using a much easier method.

1. remove any existing workspace directory, and start Eclipse

2. Use window-&gt;open perspective and choose Java

3. once the Java perspective opens, click on the "hierarchy" tab. The error 
message will appear in the launch shell window.

OS: HP-UX 11.0, Eclipse V2.1 Build ID: 200303192032 (RC3),  Java version 
1.3.1_08

Created attachment 4332
RC3 config file for WID error
Verified on fully patched and up-to-date server (HP-UX 11.00).  See also bug # 
35244 for a similar problem with the Hierarchy view.
The previous comment should be clarified to read "Problem verified to STILL BE 
OCCURRING on a fully patched and up-to-date server (HP-UX 11.00)"
Problem does NOT occur on HP-UX 11.11, or Solaris 9.
GG, didn't we fix this already?  Please confirm and close.
Yes, this is the hp-ux manifestion of bug 35774 .  To see this, do the 
following and you'll get the same trace as originally attached here:

- start a completely new eclipse workspace
- open the Java Type Hierarchy perspective
- open the Plug-in Development perspective
- switch to the opened Java Type Hierarchy perspective
- switch to the opened Plug-in Development perspective</WithOutStack>

It looks like the brower receives the URL parameter only up to the first "&amp;"

Part of the problem is that Custom browser is prepending the command that user

case of launching IExplore.exe it is not needed.  If I point custom browser to 
IExplore or mozilla.exe in the preferences, and have the code that

    <WithStack>Here is the patch for Windows. It is a fairly big one as it includes fixes for 
a few Windows and Firebird problems as well as extensive modifications to the 
script files to support Windows and Firebird. Included with the ant scripts 
are two model property files that are intended to be copied to a user's home 
directory and then edited for local preferences.

Also note that the default installation location for Windows will be \Program 
Files\Stellation with the rest of the install tree the same as Linux.

Zip of all patch files

You will need to filter out .classpath and .project in core.patch. I was unable
to convince Eclipse to ignore them.
I've checked this, and encountered a couple of problems.

There are a few patch glitches, which look like tab-related issues. They're
no big deal. But the patch build-core.xml in the core project doesn't match
up at all, and can't be applied. So it's a no-go, until we can figure
out what's wrong.

I'd suggest checking if you're up to date with the repository - the kinds of
other glitches that I saw look like the kinds of things that could happen if
you missed one checkin, and there was a recent checkin that included
a bunch of build-file changes.

Ant build scripts, test scripts and related files for Windows and Linux

This zip contains a set of scripts and associated files which have been tested
on both Win2K and Linux (RH7.3) systems, in both local-server and remote-server
test modes.

Zip contents include:
- build-core.xml, stellation.build.properties
	used for building and installing Stellation

- test/build.xml, test/stellation.test.properties
	used for testing the installation

- test/runserver.bat, test/runserver.sh
	used for launching a Stellation server for remote-mode testing

Build and Test Script Changes

- changed build-core.xml (build script) and test/build.xml (test script) to
create 
stellation.build.properties and stellation.test.properties if not found, using
default settings

- changed build.xml to fail with appropriate message if
stellation.build.properties does not contain all settings required)
(note: this failure occurs by design when the default
stellation.test.properties file is created).

- added force-init target to build.xml.  This is needed to properly set up a
remote test using a localhost server.
The remote test procedure is:
a) stop server (if running)
b) if necessary, modify stellation.test.properties to select remote mode or
other settings
c) in org.eclipse.stellation.core/test, run "ant force-init" to create and
initialize a clean test db
d) start server (e.g. via runserver.bat or runserver.sh)
e) in a separate console window, run the remote tests: in
org.eclipse.stellation.core/test, run "ant"

This is **different** (and more convenient) than the previous test procedure. 
Formerly, it was necessary to: 
- manually delete the old test db (e.g. 'dropdb tsvctest' ),  
- create an empty test db (e.g. 'createdb tsvctest')
- initialize the db for use by Stellation (e.g. 'tsvcadmin .....').

Now, "ant force-init" does the whole job.

Script Additions

- added test/runserver.sh and test/runserver.bat scripts to conveniently 
launch a Stellation server for remote-mode testing.  These scripts include 
hard-coded database pathnames, and require customization before use.   
They also enable verbose debug output and logging to a file.

Other Notes

"ant -verbose some &gt;test.log 2&gt;&amp;1" is very useful when debugging the test 
script.  This command-line redirects all output to test.log, and runs a 
single test rather than the full set of 14.

The '+' separator _must_ be used within the repository location specifier.  
The previous separator, ':', is now treated as a legal pathname character.

Windows pathnames in property and batch files should use '/', not '\' .
Use of '\' causes weird problems (e.g. damaged pathnames) because it 
is sometimes interpreted as an escape character.

Under Windows, "installed" files are put in possibly-surprising locations.
- The test and build property files are copied into ${user.home}/stellation.
On my Win2K system, this resolves to 
"C:\Documents and Settings\jwright\stellation" 
- The scripts and library files are copied to locations under ${inst.path}.
On my Win2K system, this resolves to "C:\Program Files\Stellation" 

Also - a number of 3rd-party libraries are needed for the installation.
The build-core.xml install target expects to find these libraries in
${build.class.lib}, which defaults to ${user.home}/stellation/lib. 
On my Win2K system, this resolves to 
"C:\Documents and Settings\jwright\stellation\lib" .

All of these default locations may be changed by appropriate use of the 
stellation.build.properties and stellation.test.properties files.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In the Create, Manage, and Run Configurations screen, select the Classpath

the "Use default classpath" checkbox twice in order for the classpath to

Actually, even more preferable would be if the configuration classpath could be 
built with something like "base default classpath" + "some custom classpath".  
Currently, I have to keep updating all the custom classpaths when the base 
default classpath changes.
Presumably this is a launch configuration issue.
Fixed. The same problem existed on the source lookup tab. To reproduce I had to:
* Create a non-default classpath (or source path)
* save the config
* close the dialog
* re-open the dialog on the config
* click the "use default" button -&gt; did not update

The problem was that the dirty flag was set too late in the process, and the 
working copy was not updated with the "default" attribute before the classpath 
was re-computed (and thus, the same classpath was recomputed).
Please verify, Joe.

    <WithStack>I've been using Eclipse since it was first available.  Adding .jar files to my
project has always, and I mean always, caused me heartache.  The easiest
solution I could think of is for the JDT to automatically add any jar files
found in the .\Project\jars directory.  Just like source is added from the
.\Project\source directory.  Refreshing the project would update the jar list
along with the source files.

I probably have between 3 and 5 projects going at any one time.  I rarely use a
particular jar in more than single project.  My proposed solution does nothing
for people who want to share a single jar across many projects.  (Sorry, I
haven't given it any thought.)
Moving to JDT/UI for comment.
This is not critical enough for 2.1 (we are already working on release 
candidate 3). Postponing &gt; 2.1
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>i have a ant script that updates the contents
of an *existing* jar file. the script works
fine when started from the command line but
not when run from eclipse.
instead of updating the existing jar eclipse
erases the old one and creates a new one.

this is the part of the ant script:

&lt;target name="jar" depends="timestamp"&gt;
&lt;jar     jarfile="${target.dir}/lib/${target.jar.file}.jar"
    basedir="${basedir}/classes"
    excludes="**/*.class"
    manifest="${basedir}/build/manifest.mf"
    update="yes"/&gt; 
&lt;/target&gt;

eclipse ant support seems to ignore the update="yes" statement
Mark, when you are running from the command line, are you using Ant 1.5.2?
Darin, i used 1.4.1 for my work. Based on your feedback
I tested my script with 1.5.2 on the command line. I used 
the Ant jar files from the Eclipse RC2 distribution.
I can reproduce the error with this version. So it really seams to be
a problem with Ant 1.5.2.

Any idea if this is a know Ant bug?
 
Mark, I know that Ant has had trouble with the zip / jar tasks in 1.5.2. I 
don't know all the specifics. 
I would recommend you ask on the Ant user group. Both the dev and user groups 
can be viewed at http://ant.apache.org/mail.html</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>i have a ant script that updates the contents
of an *existing* jar file. the script works
fine when started from the command line but
not when run from eclipse.
instead of updating the existing jar eclipse
erases the old one and creates a new one.

this is the part of the ant script:

&lt;target name="jar" depends="timestamp"&gt;
&lt;jar     jarfile="${target.dir}/lib/${target.jar.file}.jar"
    basedir="${basedir}/classes"
    excludes="**/*.class"
    manifest="${basedir}/build/manifest.mf"
    update="yes"/&gt; 
&lt;/target&gt;

eclipse ant support seems to ignore the update="yes" statement
Mark, when you are running from the command line, are you using Ant 1.5.2?
Darin, i used 1.4.1 for my work. Based on your feedback
I tested my script with 1.5.2 on the command line. I used 
the Ant jar files from the Eclipse RC2 distribution.
I can reproduce the error with this version. So it really seams to be
a problem with Ant 1.5.2.

Any idea if this is a know Ant bug?
 
Mark, I know that Ant has had trouble with the zip / jar tasks in 1.5.2. I 
don't know all the specifics. 
I would recommend you ask on the Ant user group. Both the dev and user groups 
can be viewed at http://ant.apache.org/mail.html</WithOutStack>

When creating a variable CP entry, no check is made that the path is absolute, 
however, when attempting to set a classpath containing such an entry, it will 
fail validation then.

It could have been detected earlier.
Actually, the problem is slightly different. Issue comes from the fact that the 
variable value wasn't an absolute path. 

Variable settings should likely enforce an absolute path is used then, 
wondering though if source attachments are expecting absolute paths though

		JavaCore.setClasspathVariable("MyVar", new Path("P/lib"), null);
		IJavaProject proj =  this.createJavaProject("P", new String[] 
{}, "bin");
		this.createFolder("/P/lib");
		final int length = 200;
		IClasspathEntry[] classpath = new IClasspathEntry[length];
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++){
			this.createFile("/P/lib/lib"+i+".jar", "");
			classpath[i] = JavaCore.newVariableEntry(new Path
("/MyVar/lib"+i+".jar"), null, null);
		}
		proj.setRawClasspath(classpath, null);

Not critical, just need to check
Source attachment root path is not expected to be absolute.
Ok to close then.
Closing</WithStack>

in 2.1 RC2 I can't find a option for enable the editor drop-down list. There's
no "Show Editors drop-down" preference and there's no view "Window / Show View /
Other... / Basic / Editors". This option was implemented for the M4 Milestone.
This is a duplicate of Bug 32226.

    <WithStack>Hi,

running or debugging applets does not work if the project directory isn't in the
"eclipse/workspace" directory. When I try to start a applet I get the error
message "Specified working directory does not exist or is not a directory:
D:\eclipse\workspace\test1". But "test1" is only the name of the project. The
source and output folder is "S:\test_development".

Running classes as applications works.

creation. Following happens, from the navigator pane, use: 
new-&gt;folder from the context menu, the new folder dialog pops open, enter a 
name and press ok, the dialog itself seems to run in an endless loop at this stage.
Werner, if you can reproduce this, could you please try the following:
run eclipse with:
eclipse -vm {yourJRELocation}/bin/java -data {yourWorkspaceLocation}

when it hangs, send a kill -3 to the process.  This should get it to generate a 
file containing stack dumps for all the threads.

You could also try the latest integration build, since we have addressed 
several hang and deadlock problems since RC2 (we are building the RC3 candidate 
today).

Could you also please indicate:
- which VM you're using
- any command line args
- whether it hangs at 100% cpu usage or 0

See also bug 35044, another deadlock when creating a folder, this time on 
Windows.

Andrew, can you investigate these please?
Werner, is there anything special about your setup?  Are you using just the 
plain eclipse SDK, or are there other plugins installed?
Werner,

Please attach the output from the configuration details (Help-&gt;About Eclipse-
&gt;Configuration Details.
Created attachment 4245
The configuration which causes the problem

Note I use Blackdown J2SDK 1.4.1 but I can reproduce the bug with a standard
Sun JDK as well. The Motif version is not affected however.
Just a note, the command line argument -Xmx200m must be the last argument to 
take effect, otherwise it is ignored.
Ok I forgot, extra Plugins installed: 
 
Planty  (Ant Editor Plugin latest version from the net) 
VeloEdit (same for Velocity) 
and 
Jalopy (Sourcecode Formatter) 
 
Machine configuration: 
Generic Gentoo Linux, with a 2.4.20 CK4 Kernel which has 
preemtive scheduling and low latency enabled. The system 
is running on a ReiserFS partition, XFree 4.2.1 GTK 2.2.1/GTK 1.2.10-r9 
Processor Athlon TBird 900, 700MB Ram 
 
as for the -Xmx200, thanks for the hint, but didn't solve the problem because it 
already is like that: here my startup script: 
 
#!/bin/sh 
cd /home/werpu/development/eclipse 
./eclipse -vm /opt/blackdown-j2sdk1.4.1/bin/java -Xmx 200m 
 
 
Sorry, I just noticed the bug with the blank in -Xmx200m in my startup script,
corrected it, but doesn't help with the problem, the memory doesn't really seem
to be the issue, my personal guess is some kind of concurrency problem/deadlock
I'm running into in the create directory dialog since I run an optimized kernel.

Werner, when it hangs, which processes are consuming CPU?
We've seen various hanging problems on GTK 2.1.1, which sometimes show CPU 
split between the X server and eclipse java vm at about 60%/30%.
We haven't done much testing on GTK 2.2 or GTK 2.2.1 since we've been having a 
hard time actually getting a stable install of it on RedHat 8 or 8.1.

Felipe, are you aware of any such hang problems in RC2?

Unfortunately I'm out of the office right now, so I can't really test. But I
went on from a clean installation on my home pc (pretty similar config) and
installed the plugins. The problem is not reproducable here. My personal guess
now goes towards a problematic project file (the project files were rather old,
imported from 2.0 by moving the desktop).
I will give it a try tomorrow as soon as I am back in the office.
See Bug31525, comment 46.

The symptoms here are similar to the problem addressed in bug 31525.

In self-hosting workspace, I was searching for references to 
IClasspathEntry#getEntryKind() in jdt/core and was surprised by how long it 
took given only 58 references are expected.

I forced a thread dump in the console, and it appears that the reconciler is 
causing trouble by trigger reconcile operations for all editors (is it for all 
search match or those which have an editor open at the moment), likely to add 
decorations for search markers. 

I had about 20 editors opened (across 3 windows).

When refreshing for a marker change, it shouldn't trigger a full refresh of 
errors in editors (also, is it refreshing more than visible editors?).

&gt;causing trouble by trigger reconcile operations for all editors 
since we are searching the contents of editors (working copies) I assume this 
is needed to make sure that the working copies are correct.
CompilationUnitAnnotationModel triggers an:

workingCopy.reconcile(true, null);

which forces problem refresh. This isn't justified in a search scenario, since 
no actual file content is changed which could alter problem diagnosis.

This is way overkilling.
Daniel, can you please comment on this. 
We (jdt/core) should include timing trace for better understanding why search 
actions could be slow. Reconciliation with errors is taking time, and will be 
perceived as part of the search action.
&gt;since we are searching the contents of editors (working copies) I assume this 
&gt;is needed to make sure that the working copies are correct.

The reconcile happens when the editors process the resource delta. The editor's
model needs to be updated. There is already a PR whch says reconcile should only
be called when the delta contains potential changes.

    <WithStack>I had a type C open in both the Java editor and the type hirarchy.

Focus of the type hirarchy was on some baseclass A.

The type hirarchy showed a sibling class B of C, i.e.,

  class B extends A
  class C extends A

I manually edited the source code of C, in the Java editor, changing it to

  class C extends B

, and saved that change.

That structural change did not propagate properly to the type view.

This may or may not be related to bug 35020.
Can't be reproduce using the simple A, B, C case. When changing the supertype 
of C from A to B the type hierarchy updates correctly.

Andreas, can you provide any additional information. Is there something in the 
log ?
Forgot to mention that I used I20030318

Ooops - I should have mentioned,
B and C are inner types of some (different) classes.

I use RC2 aka 200303071024.
Can't reproduce even if B and C are static inner types of a class D. Any 
additional hint to reproduce this.
Closing, no reponse from reporter and not able to reproduce problem.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Using 0317 build, when I import existing binary plugins in my workspace without
copied them locally, I end up with missing icons in the plugin editor when I
open the plugin.xml file (Red square). This is pretty ugly.
It looks like the editor is unable to retrieve the icon in a linked folder.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Start a fresh workspace
2) Import all plugins in binary form without copied them locally
3) Open org.eclipse.jdt.ui
4) Open the plugin.xml file
5) You can see that some icons are missing.
6) Go to the Extensions tab
7) Expand: org.eclipse.ui.perspectives

You will find something similar to the next screenshot.

    <WithStack>Here is the list of the properties used in the builder and the packager with a 
brief description.

(xxx) are old name or properties, the new name is given after. 

Packager
========

workingDirectory: The directory where all the packaging related files will be 
generated, unzipped, ...
downloadDirectory: The directory where the files will be downloaded
tempDirectory: The directory in which the files will be unzipped, and zipped 
from
resultDirectory: The directory where all the results of the packager will be 
stored (used now)

packagingInfo: The directory in which the file called packager.properties is 
located
packagingProperties: A relative path to the file containing the properties for 
element to package

contentFilter: a comma separated list of value used to filter the files that 
are downloaded
config: The config for which the packager is running (it is only one config)
featureList: A comma separated list of features to package

featurePaths: A comma separated list of paths where features and plugins are 
located. An entry must point to one level up above the "features" and "plugins" 
directory (example eclipse)

(collBase) zipBase: The directory from which the zip will be built
(collPlace) rootZipDirectory: The directory that will be used as a root in the 
zip. All the files to be zipped must be under this directory.
A typical configuration of those variables is:
  zipBase=.
  rootZipDirectory=eclipse

zipArgs: Extra arguments that can be passed to the zip command
unzipArgs: Extra arguments that can be passed to the unzip command




Builder
=======
mapVersionTag: Version of the map files used
buildDirectory: The directory in which the build will happen

(collBase) zipBase: The directory from which the zip will be built
(collPlace) rootZipDirectory: The directory that will be used as a root in the 
zip. All the files to be zipped must be under this directory.

configs: an ampersand separated list of config (each component of a config is 
separated by a comma)

bootClasspath: The path to a rt.jar
javacFailOnError: The value that will be used as a parameter to the failonerror 
property of the javac ant task
javacDebugInfo: The value that will be used as a parameter to the debuginfo 
property of the javac ant task
javacVerbose: The value that will be used as a parameter to the verbose 
property of the javac ant task


zipArgs: Extra arguments that can be passed to the zip command
unzipArgs: Extra arguments that can be passed to the unzip command

baseLocation: An installation of eclipse to compile against
baseOs: The Os of the eclipse installed in baseLocation
baseWs: The ws of the eclipse installed in baseLocation
baseArch: The arch of the eclipse installed in baseLocation


Eclipse specific vars
---------------------
buildLabel:
buildId:	also these vars are now used to in some scripts, they should be 
replaced by more generic names
buildType:

timestamp
noMail
When doing the replacement/renaming check the case of:
  baseLocation
  javacFailOnError
  baseOS
  baseWS
  baseArch
  bootClasspath

  buildId
  buildLabel
  buildType

Check the scripts for buildid, buildID, buildId

  javacSource
  javacTarget

collBase and collPlace have been removed and replaced with archivePrefix and
collectingFolder.

Martin, AFAIU you're pointing to another problem, which explains why more 
choices are available in code assist, however I'd like to attract your 
attention to the fact that in code snapshot there is already imported class 
org.w3c.dom.Node (like I said all types, except Element, are resolved) and 
org.w3c.dom.Element is definitely visible in the context.
yes, you're right. moving back to jdt.ui

The bug is in our all types cache.
Method getTypesForName returns not all the types with the given name if the 
workspace contains several project with the types of the same qualified type 
name. In the case of such a workspace, organize import would remove imports as 
it can't find the types

All types except "Element" are resolved.
Apply "Organize Imports", there are 3 variants (including e.g. 
javax.swing.text.Element), but no org.w3c.dom one.
On manual code assist (i.e. CTRL-SPACE after "Element"), I'm getting required 
org.w3c.dom.

There are no clashes in imports.

maybe it's fine but it seems like package explorer filters load plugins eagerly
so, after startup, you have pde.ui and pde.core loaded, you want it or not

not sure if this can be avoided, though
Are the plugins also loaded when the filter isn't checked?
This is caused by the binary plugin filter. The two plug-ins are only loaded 
if the filter is active. So there is nothing we can do here.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hello,
We have several pbs with CVS, especially for this bug report for merging 
branches. We have tried the Merge menu item in the navigator view, but without 
success. So we tried another way to merge branches ; for instance we want to 
merge a version X on a branch A onto the Head branch for making a Version Y
* we update locally the project_head from server
* we update locally the project_branchA version X from the server
* we make a comparison to see the changes (just for check) but we want to copy 
everything from X  at the same time
* we copy the selected directory from the Version X branch
* we paste this directory in the head branch (the directory already exists)
!!!This paste operation does copy also CVS information from project X into the 
branch head; we don't want to copy these information!!!
So we try anopther thing ; we export the slected dir on disk to eliminate the 
CVS repository information, and we try to copy from a windows explorer into the 
eclipse workbench the files inside the directory...without success

How can we do a clean merging between branches?
Start by explaining why the Merge action didn't work? 
It is not doing what we expected (see the mail), ie it doesn't act as we 
expected it was...Actually, the merge function is not usable in its form by us 
(6 engineers in the department)...
What mail? 

You have to understand that we use the merge action all the time and it works
with our use-cases. We would like to understand, very exactly, what isn't
working for you. We need steps to reproduce and not just "it isn't working as we
expected". 
the bug report if you prefer. I know it is not obvious to maintain this part of 
code in eclipse, but we have a user point of view which is not the developper 
point of view. Personaly, I try to convince people in my team to use eclipse, 
and especially TeamCVS. Many of my bug, or enhancement reports are only the 
feeling of my engineers (and me) about some functionalities. It seems to them 
that it is often quite complicated to achieve their goals, like merging, 
recovering an old version on the current branch locally without changing the 
project properties (for instance, if you have locally a branch locally 
synchronized with the server, and you want to replace your current code by code 
of another version on the same branch, you use the "replace ..;" menu item. If 
you do that, and you look at the CVS properties of the project, you see that 
the branch name as been replaced by the version name, and it is not what we 
intend to have), seeing the branch tree, having some information about version 
in the CVS repository view, and so on... Very often to these requirements, I 
received an answer like : "we can't do that because... Won't fix  ", but the 
needs are still there!!! It seems to me there are techhnical possibilities to 
achieve  these goals : use of the .project file (which should be saved in 
repositoy or updated from the server automatically), the CVSROOT directory with 
other added files (like CVSMailer does for instance), and so on...

To replace a file in the workbench with the contents of another revision, use
the History view. Then select the revision and from the context menu select "Get
Contents". This will get the revision contents but not update the base revision
of the file in your workbench.

It is unfair to say that we don't want to fix or even consider your enhancement
requests. But you have to provide clear, detailed steps to either reproduce or
good explanation of the requested feature. We have *tons* of work to do and we
can't possibly spend all that time trying to understand vague bugs reports.

I've answered the main question in the original bug.

    <WithStack>build I20030317

From a Sametime transcript with Dejan...

Nick_Edgar@ca...	Dejan, I had a strange problem last night on 
I20030317.  I tried reimporting my binary projects, but it pulled them out of 
an older install (I20030313).  (I put each build in a separate dir).  The 
Target Platform pref page was pointing to d:\eclipse-I20030313\eclipse.  I 
could not change it back to "this application" because that radio button was 
disabled.  I the "another compatible application" field to point to d:\eclipse-
I20030317\eclipse and tried re-importing, but this time org.eclipse.swt did not 
find its jar, so there were 1000s of compilation errors.  Just upgraded to 
I20030318.  This time the import dialog came up showing d:\eclipse-I20030318, 
but it had the same problem with import.  In the target platform page, "this 
application" is still disabled.  Not sure how it got updated from pointing to 
d:\eclipse-I20030317
Nick_Edgar@c...	to d:\eclipse-I20030318.
Nick_Edgar@c...	Tried deleting my .config dir, and also any metadata under 
org.eclipse.pde.core, but this made no difference.
Nick_Edgar@c...	Switching to a new workspace and reconstructing a self-hosting 
workspace worked OK.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	'This application' means that we are initializing our 
model directly from the live registry. We had problems with this optimization 
in the second Eclipse instance because some of the plug-ins are source plug-ins 
in the dev workspace (the first instance). That is why we prohibit using 'This 
application' when in second, third etc. instance (i.e. when 
BootLoader.isDevelopmentMode returns true).
Nick_Edgar@c...	I was not running my target.  All the above happened in the 1st 
instance.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	The only time when 'This application' is disabled is 
when 'BootLoader.isDevelopmentMode' is returning true. Are you using '-dev' in 
your first instance?
Nick_Edgar@c...	I do launch with -dev bin -update, though
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	There you go
Nick_Edgar@c...	Was this a recent change?  This always worked fine for me 
before I20030317.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Yes.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	We thought that '-dev' is exclusive to launched 
(second) instance.
Nick_Edgar@c...	You should announce this to eclipse-dev.  Many others run with -
dev bin.
Nick_Edgar@c...	It's used when you want to run with a patch against your 1st 
instance.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Ack.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	The assumption we make is that all the plug-ins in the 
registry are binary i.e. have JARs. If that is not the case i.e. if some 
classes are not packaged in JARs, many PDE operations that depend on it may 
fail. That is why we wanted to guard from that case.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	For example, when you import plug-ins, you expect that 
they don't contain source. Not finding JARs messes up the whole binary plug-in 
import.
Nick_Edgar@c...	Why did it end up treating org.eclipse.swt differently?  This 
sounds similar to the problem with source imports that Andrew reported against 
RC2.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	I don't know.
Nick_Edgar@c...	I think the old behaviour is preferable, and I would consider 
the new behaviour to be a regression.  I want to run with -dev bin because I 
want the ability to run with a patch against my host.  I'm fine if PDE import 
does not see the patches, and just imports the jars.  As it is now, PDE import 
does not work at all if I run with -dev bin.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Ack
Nick_Edgar@c...	I'll capture this discussion in a PR.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Thanks.
Nick_Edgar@c...	Any idea why it changed the "other application" from I20030317 
to I20030318.  I would have thought that a manually entered field would not get 
changed automatically.  I thought that was why it was still referring to 
I20030313.  It seems like it is updated sometimes, but not always.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	If you manually enter something, it will preserve it. 
If you never change it, we use the default value and this default value is 
computed.
Nick_Edgar@c...	This is not the behaviour I saw. When I noticed I was getting 
stale plugins when importing on I20030317, the "other application" was set to 
my I20030313 dir.  I manually changed it to my I20030317 dir.  When I upgraded 
to I20030318, "other application" was automatically changed to my I20030318 dir.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	OK, it may be a different bug.
Nick_Edgar@c...	I was unable to reproduce the problem with importing 
org.eclipse.swt in a new workspace.  If I run with or without -dev bin -update, 
it works OK and includes the jar from org.eclipse.swt.win32.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	We may still have a bug, but ellusive :-)
Nick_Edgar@c...	OK, thanks.  I'll file the PR to capture this.
To be clear, I consider this to be a regression.

Have checked some of the extra internal core team tests as we do use -dev but 
not usually on the first Eclipse.  Looks like we are okay so far but we do 
consider this a regression as well.
In the strict term, this is reduction in flexibility, but we should pull 
further back and ask why -dev was added in the first place. It was always there 
to aid self-hosting i.e. to be used on the launched Eclipse, not on the first 
instance. The fact that we may be using -dev for what it was not designed for 
is orthogonal IMHO.
Thanks for the notice on eclipse-dev. And, yes, I for one sometimes need to run 
with -dev bin. 
Plus, sounds like this change would effect all "down stream" products, such as 
WSAD ... and I would guess that the further downstream you go, the higher the 
probability that someone somewhere sometime has to run with -dev bin, to make 
use of some fix, usually to get around a "show stopping" problem until official 
fix comes out. While hopefully would never be common-place, to never have it at 
all seems a big (new) limitation. I confess I didn't quite follow all the 
reasons (pros and cons) for the change, in the IM chat exchange, but just 
wanted to make this point about "down stream" products (and their developers) 
being effected too. 

Oh, but maybe I misunderstand. Dejan, in your last comment, you say "intended 
to be used for self hosting, on the launched eclipse, not on first instance"
I was assuming 'first instance' was the launched eclipse. In either case, my 
main concern is with the self-hosting situation, during the development of 
other downstream products ... so that case still works?
I use -dev bin in my outer (1st) eclipse a lot to run with and test fixes in my 
live development environment. I don't think it should be used to differentiate 
between running an outer vs. inner Eclipse. The "Running Eclipse" doc does not 
mention any restrictions for using this option.
I did not notice a problem with plugin import because I rename my eclipse 
directory before unzipping a new build.

DJ confirmed that plug-ins can access command line arguments.

Using this capability, PDE workbench launcher can pass a command line argument 
that only PDE understands (for example, -launched or something). We would do 
the same as today, but instead of checking 'BootLoader.isDevelopmentMode()', we 
would check for presence of the command line argument. This would effectively 
remove the regression in the first instance (we would not disable 'this 
application' even if -dev was used).

Does anybody have objections to the proposed solution? If you agree in 
principal, do you have suggestions for the actual argument name (to minimise 
name collisions)? 
-pdelaunch?

Something like that.
Fixed.

PDE launcher will from now on be passing -pdelaunch command line argument to 
the instance it is launching. PDECore class is now checking for the argument in 
its constructor and sets the flag. We added PDECore.inLaunchedInstance() method 
to use elsewhere in PDE whenever we need to do something differently in this 
mode.

We will not be affected by -dev usage any more.


Did this actually make it into the RC3 rebuild (I20030319)?  From the timing of 
messages on the eclipse-dev list it looks like it, but can you confirm?


It did.
I just downloaded RC3 candidate and confirmed that this fix is in.</WithStack>

when 'BootLoader.isDevelopmentMode' is returning true. Are you using '-dev' in 
your first instance?
Nick_Edgar@c...	I do launch with -dev bin -update, though
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	There you go
Nick_Edgar@c...	Was this a recent change?  This always worked fine for me 
before I20030317.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Yes.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	We thought that '-dev' is exclusive to launched 
(second) instance.
Nick_Edgar@c...	You should announce this to eclipse-dev.  Many others run with -
dev bin.
Nick_Edgar@c...	It's used when you want to run with a patch against your 1st 
instance.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Ack.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	The assumption we make is that all the plug-ins in the 
registry are binary i.e. have JARs. If that is not the case i.e. if some 
classes are not packaged in JARs, many PDE operations that depend on it may 
fail. That is why we wanted to guard from that case.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	For example, when you import plug-ins, you expect that 
they don't contain source. Not finding JARs messes up the whole binary plug-in 
import.
Nick_Edgar@c...	Why did it end up treating org.eclipse.swt differently?  This 
sounds similar to the problem with source imports that Andrew reported against 
RC2.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	I don't know.
Nick_Edgar@c...	I think the old behaviour is preferable, and I would consider 
the new behaviour to be a regression.  I want to run with -dev bin because I 
want the ability to run with a patch against my host.  I'm fine if PDE import 
does not see the patches, and just imports the jars.  As it is now, PDE import 
does not work at all if I run with -dev bin.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Ack
Nick_Edgar@c...	I'll capture this discussion in a PR.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	Thanks.
Nick_Edgar@c...	Any idea why it changed the "other application" from I20030317 
to I20030318.  I would have thought that a manually entered field would not get 
changed automatically.  I thought that was why it was still referring to 
I20030313.  It seems like it is updated sometimes, but not always.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	If you manually enter something, it will preserve it. 
If you never change it, we use the default value and this default value is 
computed.
Nick_Edgar@c...	This is not the behaviour I saw. When I noticed I was getting 
stale plugins when importing on I20030317, the "other application" was set to 
my I20030313 dir.  I manually changed it to my I20030317 dir.  When I upgraded 
to I20030318, "other application" was automatically changed to my I20030318 dir.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	OK, it may be a different bug.
Nick_Edgar@c...	I was unable to reproduce the problem with importing 
org.eclipse.swt in a new workspace.  If I run with or without -dev bin -update, 
it works OK and includes the jar from org.eclipse.swt.win32.
dejan@ca.ibm.c...	We may still have a bug, but ellusive :-)
Nick_Edgar@c...	OK, thanks.  I'll file the PR to capture this.
To be clear, I consider this to be a regression.

Have checked some of the extra internal core team tests as we do use -dev but 
not usually on the first Eclipse.  Looks like we are okay so far but we do 
consider this a regression as well.
In the strict term, this is reduction in flexibility, but we should pull 
further back and ask why -dev was added in the first place. It was always there 
to aid self-hosting i.e. to be used on the launched Eclipse, not on the first 
instance. The fact that we may be using -dev for what it was not designed for 
is orthogonal IMHO.
Thanks for the notice on eclipse-dev. And, yes, I for one sometimes need to run 
with -dev bin. 
Plus, sounds like this change would effect all "down stream" products, such as 
WSAD ... and I would guess that the further downstream you go, the higher the 
probability that someone somewhere sometime has to run with -dev bin, to make 
use of some fix, usually to get around a "show stopping" problem until official 
fix comes out. While hopefully would never be common-place, to never have it at 
all seems a big (new) limitation. I confess I didn't quite follow all the 
reasons (pros and cons) for the change, in the IM chat exchange, but just 
wanted to make this point about "down stream" products (and their developers) 
being effected too. 

Oh, but maybe I misunderstand. Dejan, in your last comment, you say "intended 
to be used for self hosting, on the launched eclipse, not on first instance"
I was assuming 'first instance' was the launched eclipse. In either case, my 
main concern is with the self-hosting situation, during the development of 
other downstream products ... so that case still works?
I use -dev bin in my outer (1st) eclipse a lot to run with and test fixes in my 
live development environment. I don't think it should be used to differentiate 
between running an outer vs. inner Eclipse. The "Running Eclipse" doc does not 
mention any restrictions for using this option.
I did not notice a problem with plugin import because I rename my eclipse 
directory before unzipping a new build.

DJ confirmed that plug-ins can access command line arguments.

Using this capability, PDE workbench launcher can pass a command line argument 
that only PDE understands (for example, -launched or something). We would do 
the same as today, but instead of checking 'BootLoader.isDevelopmentMode()', we 
would check for presence of the command line argument. This would effectively 
remove the regression in the first instance (we would not disable 'this 
application' even if -dev was used).

Does anybody have objections to the proposed solution? If you agree in 
principal, do you have suggestions for the actual argument name (to minimise 
name collisions)? 
-pdelaunch?

Something like that.
Fixed.

PDE launcher will from now on be passing -pdelaunch command line argument to 
the instance it is launching. PDECore class is now checking for the argument in 
its constructor and sets the flag. We added PDECore.inLaunchedInstance() method 
to use elsewhere in PDE whenever we need to do something differently in this 
mode.

We will not be affected by -dev usage any more.


Did this actually make it into the RC3 rebuild (I20030319)?  From the timing of 
messages on the eclipse-dev list it looks like it, but can you confirm?


It did.
I just downloaded RC3 candidate and confirmed that this fix is in.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>When renaming a java-template in RC2 a message dialog is shown. It says: 'The

It's not a major bug but I was a bit confused so it should change ;)
Moving to JDT/UI for comment.
Agreed the message should be replace/create

not critical enough for 2.1

The new "transient" marker attribute (see bug 9267) has a boolean type. A 
marker is now persistent if its type is persistent and its transient attribute 
is not set to true.

The code in MarkerManager for checking if a given marker is persistent will 
fail (throws a ClassCastException) in a lot of different contexts if for some 
reason the user has set the attribute to a non-boolean value:

public boolean isPersistent(MarkerInfo info) {
	if (!cache.isPersistent(info.getType()))
		return false;
	Boolean isTransient = (Boolean) info.getAttribute(IMarker.TRANSIENT); 
	return isTransient == null || !isTransient.booleanValue();
}

It should use "instanceof Boolean" before casting:

public boolean isPersistent(MarkerInfo info) {
	if (!cache.isPersistent(info.getType()))
		return false;
	Object isTransient = info.getAttribute(IMarker.TRANSIENT); 
	return isTransient == null || !(isTransient instanceof Boolean) || !

Since the attributes have simple names, we may be breaking clients that are 
already using a "transient" attribute in their own plug-ins. And since 
persistence checking is done in a lot of places (setting any attribute, 
removing markers, saving markers, etc), it may be hard to understand the reason 
of the failure.

The new "transient" marker attribute (see bug 9267) has a boolean type. A 
marker is now persistent if its type is persistent and its transient attribute 
is not set to true.

The code in MarkerManager for checking if a given marker is persistent will 
fail (throws a ClassCastException) in a lot of different contexts if for some 
reason the user has set the attribute to a non-boolean value:

public boolean isPersistent(MarkerInfo info) {
	if (!cache.isPersistent(info.getType()))
		return false;
	Boolean isTransient = (Boolean) info.getAttribute(IMarker.TRANSIENT); 
	return isTransient == null || !isTransient.booleanValue();
}

It should use "instanceof Boolean" before casting:

public boolean isPersistent(MarkerInfo info) {
	if (!cache.isPersistent(info.getType()))
		return false;
	Object isTransient = info.getAttribute(IMarker.TRANSIENT); 
	return isTransient == null || !(isTransient instanceof Boolean) || !
((Boolean)isTransient).booleanValue();
}
