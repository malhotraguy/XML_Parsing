i'm not offered to create bar as an abstact method
don't think we should. have to try to keep the number of proposals small.
to change a method to a abstract method is not hard: add the abstract modifier
and use quick fix to remove the body

I don't follow this reasoning.

First, when I try it with the above code, I get three proposals in Eclipse 3.4. Are you suggesting that four proposals are too many?

Second, almost all things you can do with quick fixes aren't *hard* to do manually. The point is that it would *significantly enhance flow* to be able to do this with just one mouse click.

Please reconsider. Pretty please?
Looking forward for a good patch ;-)

Quick Fix adds boilerplate code, saves typing and keeps distractions to a minimum.

Adding boilerplate code being a distraction here.

I think it would make sense to add this (but with lower priority than the existing proposal).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When opening a (too) big source file into a specific editor (including a 
specific parsing), it can happen that a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError occurs, 
asking the user to exit the from the workbench.

Fine, but relaunching Eclipse causes an open action to be made again, fail 
again, and quit again,..., until the user removes the big file from the 
workspace...

It looks like an attempt to open a file (big, or wrong, or whatever) broke
the whole workbench forever...
Not sure whether this is a feature request or a bug.
Definitely a bug.

Can you reproduce this in the latest 2.1.1 build?

I've reproduced this with the build M20030602-win32 and the N20030601-win32.
Thanks in advance.
Martin
Can you provide us with a test case using the Eclipse SDK? That is, can you 
provide steps to reproduce this using the basic text editor, or the java editor?
Mmm, I tried with the Java Editor or the default text editor, but no success. 
The original use case is decribed in the Bugzilla 37424, and describes the 
OutOfMemory exception occuring when parsing and opening a big C++ source file.
That is why I believe that the easiest steps to reproduce this is to have the 
CDT installed, and open a big source file that I can provide.
With the recent changes to error handling in the workbench, you will get an
error part, and not be forced to shut down, assuming the file is read in
createPartControl, not init.  Stefan, can you confirm?

The error part is only created for recoverable exceptions, and wouldn't be
created for OOMEs (it will also be created for init exceptions -- there is a PR
open requesting this to change when init is called inside
IWorkbenchPage#openEditor or showView, but this hasn't been fixed yet).

However, the workbench now only updates its active part after the new part is
fully initialized -- so if an OOME occurs in the new part, it will still
consider the old part active when the workbench reloads. This may be fixed, but
it will be annoying to try to reproduce.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I am attaching a testcase which illustrates some sort of palette switching 
problem in SWT running on an SH4 board with WinCE. The problem is that the 
colors pink and orange aren't initially visible; they paint as black instead. 
However, if you switch away from the test app and return, you then see the pink 
and orange blocks. Once painted correctly, as you switch away from the test app 
again, you can briefly see the colors revert to black again.

Note that this should be considered low priority until we hear from the 
customer that this is a significant issue for them.

Will this be addressed in 3.1? 
Doesn't look like it.  Chrix, did you make any progress on this?
No. Note that it is not on a regular Pocket PC.

    <WithStack>When I try to checkout a module from our repository, it stops after checking 
out only a few files. I don't see any error message or warning. But when I use 
the command line version of cvs on our Solaris machines it checks out the 
complete module properly. Any way for me to debug this? Would it be helpful if 
I sent over sample copies of the files as they are stored in our repository?
It is strange that this would fail since Eclipse does not do anything special 
when checking out modules. What checkout menu action did you choose (Checkout 
as Project, Checkout As or Checkout Module)? I could believe that there were 
problems using Checkout As Project. If this is what you tried, please try 
Checkout Module.

Also, what Eclipse build are you using?
Hi Michael, I am using Eclipse 2.1 on Windows NT 4.0. A correction: I actually 
didn't check out a module, but a project. I right clicked the project and 
chose, "Checkout As..." then I selected "Java project". Our cvs repository is 
on Solaris 8 and I believe our cvs version that we're using is 1.10. This 
particular project contains java and c++ code and I don't know if there's any 
significance, but eclipse seems to stop checking code out from the directory in 
this project that contains the non-java code. (It checks out one directory 
before this that contains java code). Here is a listing of this directory with 
the native code:

eclipse seems to stop after only checking out "Art.def" from this directory.
Eclipse supports CVS 1.11.1p1 and beyond. Please upgrade your server version 
and reopen if the problem still occurs.
Invalid due to unsupported server version.
Thanks, we'll try that. Is there any way for eclipse to detect which version of 
cvs is being used and then show an error message if the version used is not 
recent enough? That would prevent this from being an issue for other people.
Eclipse does detect the server version. However, it is a bit intrusive to throw 
up an error dialog and prevent operation so the message is written to the log.
We upgraded to cvs 1.11.5 which does the trick. Thanks!

However, I think that a warning box should be displayed if someone is using a 
version that is too old as this will help people avoid having to waste time 
troubleshooting on their end. Maybe a one time warning box which is displayed 
the first time eclipse goes against a server version that is too old, but has a 
check box which the user can check so that this warning will not be displayed 
again next time eclipse communicates with that particular pserver.

To be honest this lack of eclipse working with our version of cvs was a huge 
reason why many people in my group at work didn't want to start using eclipse. 
Since no one knew what the issue was they interpreted this problem with cvs as 
a failure with eclipse instead of a failure with cvs since our command-line 
tools "just worked" but eclipse didn't.

Feel free to close again if you don't agree with my thinking.
The Error log is more prominant in 3.0 so the unsupported warning is a bit 
more visible.
fair enough. thanks.</WithStack>

If I run our NavigationTestSuite (in org.eclipse.ui.tests) I will eventually 
get a core dump trying to create a menu handle.

I can't pinpoint the exact problem case as if I run one of the component tests 
this does not occur.

    <WithStack>TooltipHelper is measuring the tip's preferred size and using that, instead of 
the root figure, which adds a line border, therefore changing the overall 
preferredsize.
This affects palette tooltips, which wrap their text when they shouldn't.
Eric - the fix has been released, but try to investigate why this didn't affect 
Labels useds as tooltips.
Looks fine to me.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>This appears to be an OS X platform specific problem.  I have a package with a large number of 
classes in it (&gt; 20).  When I open this package in the package browser (flat setting).  The package 
opens (the arrow turns down)  But the window does not get redrawn showing the files inside of it.  
I have the package browser set in fast view mode and have to close the fast view and reopen it (I 
assume forcing a repaint) which then displays the files inside of it.

This behavior does not occur when a package has only a few files in it.  I have not tested it to 
determine the break point.

I am running on a 12" PowerBook, 867 Mhz 640MB Ram with the VM's memory capped at 256.
Transferring to SWT.
SSQ to investigate and advise.

I believe this is a duplicate of Bug#36334. Are the items drawn, if you click 
in the area where the new items are supposed to be?
This does appear to be the same issue.  forcing a redraw or clicking at random shows that the tree 
is expanded just not drawn.

------------------------

now I managed to track down this issue (a similar bug is in the jdk 1.2 
compiler from sun).

I have a class 

DefaultProducer 

it has a protected method 

revokeAllItems(InfoBus bus);

Then I have a class that extends DefaultProducer: AutoFetchConnector

AutoFetchConnector has inner classes (not static ones). 
In methods of these inner classes there are some calls like this one:

AutoFetchConnector.this.revokeAllItems(bus);
This leads to the "can not resolve this member" warning messages.

If I introduce the method

	protected void revokeAllItems(InfoBus bus) {
		super.revokeAllItems(bus);
	}

in AutoFetchConnector the messages disappear.

This is a similar bug in suns jdk 1.2 compiler that leads to NoSuchField 
Exceptions during runtime.

The clas AutoFetchConnector should not be affected by the aspect I tried to 
weave in.

I use suns jdk 1.3.1_04 for building.

I hope that helps a little bit,
Vincenz

Description:  The new project window pops up momentarily, then goes blank.  
Unable to create new project.

Steps to recreate:
1.  Launch Eclipse.
2.  Select New -&gt; Project.

Expected result:  The New Project Window pops up and you are able to create a 
new project.

Execution result:  The New Project Window pops up momentarily and then it is 
just a white blank window.

Comments:
-This occurs for US English and is not TVT specific.
-This error occurs for IBM J9 also
-This error does not occur for the M20030515 build
I have seen this as well. The redraw will happen if you resize the window so 
this appears to be an initial rendering issue. Moving to SWT.

This is a GTK only issue
OS for this problem is RedHat 8.0 Professional with GTK 2.2

I do not get this error when testing with SuSe8.1 with GTK 1.0.6


This error occurs with the latest build M20030528 also.

it works for me on RedHat 9, I will try it on RedHat 8 as well.
Tod, are you able to reproduce this problem on your machine ?

Yes - I can replicate this on a  Redhat 9 machine.
I could see this on tod's machine, but not here. 
it works on ("my") SuSE 8.2 box as well.

I'll see tod tomorrow and try to figure out which are the difference between our
machines/configuration.
This is a pretty serious issue - I think it should be considered for 2.1.1.
This problem occurs on:
Eclipse 2.1.1 on RedHat 9 and 8.
This problem does not occur on:
Eclipse 2.1 on RedHat 9 and 8.

This can also be fixed by fixing the bug Bug#38349.
The fix is to use the new implementation of Text.computeSize that was released 
in HEAD last week.

Approved for inclusion in 2.1.1.  Code from Head to be moved to 2.1.1 and 
tested.  Note that this hides bug 38090.
Fixed in 2.1.1 (20030604)

    <WithStack>A separator with title is often a good replacement for group boxes. It helps 
developers align grouped components, where the Group prevents many developers 
from aligning components inside the group with other elements outside the 
group.

You may consider providing an option for the title's position: left, middle, 
right, default.

This is related to rfe#38058: "overuse of group boxes".
In Photon a Group box looks pretty much like a separator with title.
I think JFace could provide this feature, not SWT.
SN to advise.
Platform UI is in charge of Eclipse branding issues.
Please feel free to contribute a component for possible inclusion in jface
There are currently no plans to work on this feature</WithStack>

    <WithStack>A gradient separator improves the design flexibility and helps designers 
organize elegant panels. 

A gradient separator is a good alternative to groups, etched separators and 
white space. A thin gradient can separate two panel sections without drawing 
too much attention to the separator. It is good choice if plain white space 
may confuse the user. 

You can find elegant horizontal and vertical examples of such a gradient 
separator in the Windows XP login screen.
SN to advise.
Interesting, I'm giving this to Platform UI because Eclipse branding issues 
are not SWT work items until approved by the UI designers.  There doesn't seem 
to be a native gradient separator and gradients go in and out of fashion!
We're talking to the graphic designers about improvements to L&amp;F for R3.0.
Kevin, could you give them this suggestion?

I think the Forms library provides some of what is requested here and the rest is somewhat out of date</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Translator had a question about the need of certain strings to be externalized.

Key values are in English in the Keys Preferences page.

Steps to recreate:
1. Select Window -&gt; Preferences 
2. Select Workbench -&gt; Keys 
3. Select any item in the Commands box 
4. Press the pull down button next to the Key secuence field 

Question from translator:
We observed that the keys are displayed in English, however there is a file 
named: 
eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.ui.workbench\workbench_jar\org\eclipse\ui\internal\c
ommands\keysupport.properties 
that seems to contain the translation for the keys.
Should these keys be translated or should they be displayed in English?
Should consider for 2.1.1
fixed in 2.1.1. 
translator can now translate keysupport.properties. translator should make sure that no 
spaces are used in the translation as spaces are used to delimit keystrokes. 

keeping problem open until i can migrate fix to 3.0

fixed in 3.0
The keysupport.properties has already been translated.  Will this fix, make the 
translations viewable, or is retranslation needed?

Note the english file does have spaces in it.
this fix will make the translations viewable.

the fix includes an updated properties file which does not have any keys or 
values containing whitespace. leading and trailing whitespace around keys and 
values is automatically stripped, so it is not the concern. rather the concern 
was around a few two word keystroke values such as 'Arrow Up' and 'Arrow 
Down', etc. these have been renamed 'Arrow_Up' and 'Arrow_Down' until such 
time as we have a proper widget to insert key strokes wihout requiring text 
typing. the spaces currently interfere with the text widgets parsing of 
multiple keystroke keysequences, where each keystroke is delimited by a space.</WithStack>

4. Press the pull down button next to the Key secuence field 

Question from translator:
We observed that the keys are displayed in English, however there is a file 
named: 
eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.ui.workbench\workbench_jar\org\eclipse\ui\internal\c
ommands\keysupport.properties 
that seems to contain the translation for the keys.
Should these keys be translated or should they be displayed in English?
Should consider for 2.1.1
fixed in 2.1.1. 
translator can now translate keysupport.properties. translator should make sure that no 
spaces are used in the translation as spaces are used to delimit keystrokes. 

keeping problem open until i can migrate fix to 3.0

fixed in 3.0
The keysupport.properties has already been translated.  Will this fix, make the 
translations viewable, or is retranslation needed?

Note the english file does have spaces in it.
this fix will make the translations viewable.

the fix includes an updated properties file which does not have any keys or 
values containing whitespace. leading and trailing whitespace around keys and 
values is automatically stripped, so it is not the concern. rather the concern 
was around a few two word keystroke values such as 'Arrow Up' and 'Arrow 
Down', etc. these have been renamed 'Arrow_Up' and 'Arrow_Down' until such 
time as we have a proper widget to insert key strokes wihout requiring text 
typing. the spaces currently interfere with the text widgets parsing of 
multiple keystroke keysequences, where each keystroke is delimited by a space.</WithOutStack>

The checkbox tree in question is on the 'Plug-ins and Fragments tab of the the 
runtime workbench configuration.
This tree can potentially contain &gt; 1000 elements, but it's only two levels 
deep.  If I call the method setChecked(Object, boolean) a thousand times in a 
row, the operation takes ~30 seconds.  Calling setCheckedelements(Object[], 
boolean) yields the exact same result.  I'm guessing this method in turn calls 
setChecked(Object, boolean).

Note that when I use a checkbox table viewer, as we do on the PDE &gt; Target 
Platform page, calling CheckboxTableViewer.setChecked(Object, boolean) a 
thousand times takes ~ 1 second.

CheckboxTreeViewer.setChecked() is thus definitely using an inefficient lookup 
algorithm.
Are you using setUseHashlookup(true) in both cases?
It tried it both ways, it made no difference.
Wassim, since you have a test case for this already set up, would you be able 
to step through it?  I'm surprised by this, since findItem should find the 
corresponding TableTreeItem quickly due to the map lookup, and 
TableTreeItem.setChecked simply delegates to TableItem.setChecked, which should 
therefore have the same performance characteristics as as the 
CheckboxTableViewer scenario.
Nick,
note that the problem that I'm having is with the "CheckboxTreeViewer", 
not "TableTreeViewer".
I just tested it this morning with 3.0M1 and with the setUseHashLookup(true) 
flag, and it worked like a charm.
In the past when the setUseHashLookup(true) did not do make a difference, it 
could be that I inserted it at the wrong place (e.g. after the setInput(..) 
method was called).
Thanks Nick.
setUseHashlookup() has:
	Assert.isTrue(getInput() == null, "Can only enable the hash look up 
before input has been set");//$NON-NLS-1$

So I don't think that could have been the case.  Is it possible it wasn't 
getting set at all before?
It was there, but commented out.  So I must have thought at some point that it 
was having no positive effect and there was no reason to keep it around.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Tracker widget does not offer resize functionality on SWT/GTK.

SWT/Windows and SWT/Motif versions operate as expected - the resize code works

Note that the test case from bug 36610 should be tried when this is implemented.

Released fix &gt; 0529 that provides the RESIZE functionality on GTK.  The only 
piece that's missing is the warping of the pointer, since 
Display.setCursorLocation() claims that this is not supported by GTK.  Will 
revisit this issue to verify, so am keeping the report open for now.

Also added keyboard accessibility to GTK's Tracker.  Still no pointer warping 
though.

Pointer warping is not currently available through gtk or gdk, and we can't 
assume that X is underlying, so XWarpPointer cannot be used.  Marking report as 
FIXED since the gtk Tracker implementation has been completed to the extent 
that's possible.  Will keep an eye open for the introduction of this facility 
in future gtk releases.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Before the refactoring you have

foo(int a) {
   this.fA = a;
   ...
}

After refactoring "a" out of the signature you get

foo() {
   this.fA = a;
   ...
}

Now I would like to have a quick  fix that deletes the assignment to the field.
The same could happen to the field, if it is not accessed any more in the class.
What you want is a 'remove statement' quick fix whenever there is an unresolved
element error in your statement (element could be variables, methods or types)

After considerations I think it's better to not offer that. First reason is that
we have to be careful of not having too many quick fix suggestions per error. If
the list gets too long your forced to read all suggestions and selection takes
more time, making the feature less valuable (in my opinion). The list for
unresolved element is already quite big: Create field, parameter, local var.
Second reason is that removing references is a very hard problem: Most
statements have possible side effects e.g. method calls and it's not possible to
decide if they can be removed or have to be kept: user interaction is required.

    <WithOutStack>Before the refactoring you have

foo(int a) {
   this.fA = a;
   ...
}

After refactoring "a" out of the signature you get

foo() {
   this.fA = a;
   ...
}

Now I would like to have a quick  fix that deletes the assignment to the field.
The same could happen to the field, if it is not accessed any more in the class.
What you want is a 'remove statement' quick fix whenever there is an unresolved
element error in your statement (element could be variables, methods or types)

After considerations I think it's better to not offer that. First reason is that
we have to be careful of not having too many quick fix suggestions per error. If
the list gets too long your forced to read all suggestions and selection takes
more time, making the feature less valuable (in my opinion). The list for
unresolved element is already quite big: Create field, parameter, local var.
Second reason is that removing references is a very hard problem: Most
statements have possible side effects e.g. method calls and it's not possible to
decide if they can be removed or have to be kept: user interaction is required.

When I converted the inner type below to a top level type, the refactoring tool
added a parameter to "this" that is not needed in the converted type. The new
constructor looked like this:
	public JavaSearchResultCollector(EvaEditionCreator creator,
                                         List foundTypes, IProgressMonitor pm) {
		this.progressMonitor = pm;
		this.collector = creator;
		this.foundElements = foundTypes;
	}


I had to delete this parameter manually. This relates to my feature request
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38226


	private class JavaSearchResultCollector
		implements IJavaSearchResultCollector {

		private IProgressMonitor progressMonitor;
		private List foundTypes;

		public JavaSearchResultCollector(List foundTypes,
                                                 IProgressMonitor pm) {
			this.progressMonitor = pm;
			this.foundTypes = foundTypes;
		}

		public void accept(
			IResource resource,
			int start,
			int end,
			IJavaElement enclosingElement,
			int accuracy)
			throws CoreException {
			if (foundTypes != null) {
				// kick out anonymous inner classes - they are found as methods
				if (enclosingElement.getElementType() == IJavaElement.TYPE) {
					foundTypes.add(enclosingElement);
				}
			}
		}

		public IProgressMonitor getProgressMonitor() {
			return progressMonitor;
		}

		public void done() {
		}

		public void aboutToStart() {
		}
	}
Perhaps it's personal preference, but I think "this" qualifications on fields in
constructors are good because they avoid the common bug of assigning parameters
to themselves.  However, there are other cases where this refactoring adds
"this" to method invocations, which is definitely not needed. See bug 38114 for
another example.


This is not exactly what I meant. I like the "this" qualifier as well. What I
don't like is that the refactoring introduces a new parameter to call the
constructor:

Before refactoring:
public JavaSearchResultCollector(List foundTypes,
                                 IProgressMonitor pm) {

After refactoring:
public JavaSearchResultCollector(EvaEditionCreator creator,
                                 List foundTypes,
                                 IProgressMonitor pm) {

The "creator" parameter is what I don't like. OK. The documentation states that
the refactoring is designed to add this back reference. So we might have a
feature request instead of a bug report.
Adam, please comment.
if the member type is static, then no 'back pointer' is needed and none is added
otherwise, the refactoring always adds it, although it's not always needed
(it's needed only when the member type accesses members from the enclosing 
instance)

so this report is really a feature request for detecting the case where a 
nested type could be declared static (btw. there should be something that 
detects that - having non static member types, when they can be static, is bad 
style) and not add the pointer to the enclosing instance in that case

adapting severity accordingly
please comment if i misunderstood

    <WithStack>An unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the VM.
Unexpected Signal : 11 occurred at PC=0x79E63F15
Function=(null)+0x79E63F15
I'm using RedHat 9 (XFree86 4.3 , gtk2-2.2.1-4 ).
This problem has happened with JDK 1.3.1_02 and JDK 1.4.1_02.
Two cases where this happens every time for me:
1) Go to Run...
2) New JUnit
3) Select 'All Tests in Projects, Source Folder..." radio button
4) Hit 'Apply' then run.

As soon as the progress bar gets to 100% the JVM crashes.

The same crash (same error in gtk_progress_bar) also happens when adding a new
perforce server to the p4eclipse plugin ( 0.61 )


Here's the stack.

Library=/usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0
 
NOTE: We are unable to locate the function name symbol for the error
      just occurred. Please refer to release documentation for possible
      reason and solutions.

which version of eclipse are you running ?
This bug was fixed some time ago, please re-test it on a newer version of 
eclipse.


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 31941 ***</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>An unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the VM.
Unexpected Signal : 11 occurred at PC=0x79E63F15
Function=(null)+0x79E63F15
I'm using RedHat 9 (XFree86 4.3 , gtk2-2.2.1-4 ).
This problem has happened with JDK 1.3.1_02 and JDK 1.4.1_02.
Two cases where this happens every time for me:
1) Go to Run...
2) New JUnit
3) Select 'All Tests in Projects, Source Folder..." radio button
4) Hit 'Apply' then run.

As soon as the progress bar gets to 100% the JVM crashes.

The same crash (same error in gtk_progress_bar) also happens when adding a new
perforce server to the p4eclipse plugin ( 0.61 )


Here's the stack.

Library=/usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0
 
NOTE: We are unable to locate the function name symbol for the error
      just occurred. Please refer to release documentation for possible
      reason and solutions.

    <WithStack>Hi Guys,

I am using Eclipse 2.1 on Linux RedHat9 with Sun J2sdk1.4.1_02.

In a normal Open FIle operation Eclipse has displayed a messag indicating a SWT 
internal Error and the it exit.

Best Regards,

Thi is the Eclipse Error Log FIle
That's is bad, we might have a leaking in GTK.

Was you running eclipse for several days (non-stop) ?
Can you reproduce this problem ?



Hi Felipe,

I have moved to Eclipse 2.1.1 M20030528. I use Eclipse all days.

The problem heppens randomly. 

I don't know if I am able to reproduce the problem.

There are some days where eclipse crash 1 or 2 time a day and other times where
eclipse works perfectly.

Best Regards,

Andrea
Felipe is tracking GTK version/crash issues.
Andrea, do you still have this problem running on Eclipse 3.0 ?
Hello Felipe,

Sorry for my late but I was on holiday.

Actually I am using Eclipse 3.0 with j2sdk 1.4.2_05 on WinXP and Linux FC1 both.

I have not noted the problem since now. If it be occure in the future I'll
reopen the bug again.

Best Regards,

Andrea

Andrea, do you still have this problem running on Eclipse 3.0 ?
Hello Felipe,

Sorry for my late but I was on holiday.

Actually I am using Eclipse 3.0 with j2sdk 1.4.2_05 on WinXP and Linux FC1 both.

I have not noted the problem since now. If it be occure in the future I'll
reopen the bug again.

Best Regards,

Andrea
Thanks.

    <WithStack>Image encoders (note: encoders, not decoders) are only currently guaranteeing 
to work with an ImageData as provided by the matching decoder. This is not 
very useful since to really manipulate the ImageData a user often needs to 
create an Image and then gets a different ImageData back.

Image encoders should check the ImageData passed in and use the internal 
ImageData.bitblit call to convert it to a supported format 
(depth/scanlinepad/palette features). If a user needs more elaborate control 
over the details of image encoding (level of compression etc.), a third party 
library dedicated to handling image formats will have to be used. The proposed 
change will only serve the basic needs.
Do I understand correctly that this bug was split off from Bug 38186,
and that voting for this bug will allow people to save images as GIF files?
Saving an ImageData as a GIF is expected to work if your image data is of bit 
depth 1, 4 or 8. If you wish to be able to save into GIF an image with a 
different bit depth, yes you can vote for this PR.
ICO probably needs to handle more depths also.
Here's the current depths handled:
boolean isValidIcon(ImageData i) {
	if (!((i.depth == 1) || (i.depth == 4) || (i.depth == 8)))
		return false;
	int size = i.palette.colors.length;
	return ((size == 2) || (size == 16) || (size == 32) || (size == 256));
}

*** Bug 120722 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Also, from the newsgroup:
[Eclipse 3.2M3, gtk]

Snippet194 (write an animated gif) throws with message "Unsupported
color depth" under linux.

This is because the return value from Image.getImageData() is always
24-bit-direct, since Image.init() blits the 4-bit indexed data into
24-bit direct data.
*** Bug 168071 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I see the same behavior as comment #5 on MacOS X

Even though I'm creating an Image using Indexed (isDirect == false) ImageData with a depth of 4 (or 8), the image created always has a depth of 32 and is direct, due to the Image.init() blit call, resulting in "unsupported color depth" errors when using ImageLoader.save

Can you verify whether or not this will be addressed as part of the Linux-GTK duplicate bug
so....
is there a solution for this problem?
i'm trying to create some ImageData instances and put them into an array for the imageLoader instance, and it still gives me the depth error.
i do not want that the ImageData instances will be restricted to a very few number of colors...
please help.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The current CodeAssist framework is somewhat static in nature:

Editors register IContentAssistProcessor/s, and when the action is executed,
these processors submit an array of ICompletionProposal/s.

CodeAssist will bring up a small shell window/s to list the proposal, and
execute the given operation that is selected.  This works well if the only thing
that is relevant is the current cursor position as it is related to logical
structure of the text.

It will be a great advantage to add *current text cursor* position (in addition
to the current mouse cursor position) to contribute to a dynamic content
stimulation.

Example use case scenario:
The Visual Editor for Java (currently ships with the WebSphere Studio products)
provides a split pane view of text and GEF representation of the text.  It is
very likely that when the user is in the source pane (see attached figure) the
content of code assist should also reflect the current mouse position.

In the attached figure, the user wanted to add code that takes the information
from the JTextField, and add it to the JList when the JButton is pressed.

The user selects on the JButton (on the GEF canvas), use the context menu to add
an actionPerformed event skeleton.  The cursor is then positioned on the body of
the event callback  The user now wants to create the code to add the text field
info to the JList.
At this point a getJList() or (the instance variable name) jList proposal would
have been quite helpful.  This proposal would be changed as the mouse is moved
around to other components.

Currently there is no support to “change” the proposals list, as the cursor
moves around the GEF canvas; nor is there support to open the code assist shell
around where the mouse cursor is (outside the text editor).

    <WithStack>It would be great if a variable could be defined that could represent a variable
or a list of variables. For example, I have JBoss installed and several other
libraries that are used by JBoss and my applications.

I'd like to be able to define
JBoss=/usr/local/jboss
JBoss_J2EE=${JBoss}/lib/j2ee.jar
JBoss_JMX=${JBoss}/lib/jmx.jar

and also
JBoss_ALL=${JBoss}/lib:${JBoss_J2EE}:${JBoss_JMX}

and then use JBoss_ALL in my projects.

I know that I can define the three variables seperately, but I use a lot of
projects where I'm using JBoss along with various other standard groupings
of Jar files. Ideally, I'd prefer not to have to set up each variable for
each project that I use, but instead set up a pseudo-variable that I use
for each project type (JBoss or J2ME) which then defines a related set of
project libraries.

Although bug 36960 describes the idea of a project template (which in itself
it would be very handy) it wouldn't capture any changes that were made to the
template to existing projects that had already been instantiated using the
project template.

Perhaps this could be considered for the 3.0 release along with the fix for 
bug 36960
Are you talking about classpath variables ? The syntax you picked doesn't seem 
to refer to these.
Oops. Yes, you are right -- I was referring to classpath variables.
PS Was using syntax from a Bash-like shell to explain how I'd like to use
them, rather than necessarily that being the syntax they are used in Eclipse,
because of course at the moment variables cannot refer to other variables ...
Variable entries can only denote one item. Classpath containers are rather to 
be used to abstract sets of libraries. However, there is no UI at the moment to 
handcraft your owns.
Yes, I know -- that's why I raised this bug :-) 

However, allowing variables to refer to other variables would be a very neat
solution to this problem. You then already have the ability to represent these
nesting issues; in any case, the capability to 'extend' a variable is already
in the platform. All I'm suggesting is that a variable may be defined by
extending another variable, as opposed to a single classpath entry to be
an extended variable. That, in conjunction with defining a variable as a 'group'
of jars would solve this problem.

Note that there are several situations where this would be useful; J2EE with
Struts; MIDP 2.0 and Nokia extensions; J2EE with JSTL etc. Then you could
define a project to use a 'standard' set-up of the MIDP2_NOKIA rather than
having to remember to include each variable individually.
And what about abstracting all these inside a project which exports its 
libraries ? Then you could construct all combinations you want.
I'm not sure what you are referring to when you say 'these' -- can you rephrase
what you said? Thanks.
You could abstract your set of libraries through a Java project which you can 
then require on other project's classpath. This library project simply needs to 
include these JARs on its build path and tag them as exported (to dependents).

You can define multiple of these library projects, and have them export each 
other if you need to achieve some nesting.

Also projects can be shared across source control...

So taking your example, I could imagine defining a Java project named "JBoss", 
and have it denote all the JARs you would refer through the variable JBoss_ALL.
It would export these libraries.

Then some project would simply prereq the JBoss project and that would be it.

One more advantage for this solution is that if at a later stage you want to 
have sources for JBoss or change its layout, then you would simply need to 
reorganize the JBoss project accordingly. Clients could be left unchanged, 
since they don't known about its internals.

You could also separate JBoss project into several smaller projects 
(JBoss_J2EE, JBoss_JMX) so as to achieve finer granularity of reuse.
Also, using projects, you can better browse code into the proper context (JBoss 
implementation isn't mixed inside client code) and when defining working sets 
to scope search, projects are quite handy.
For all these reasons, we went for a simple variable story, relying on the fact 
there was much more powerful ways to achieve more complex stories.
I understand what you mean now :-) Yes, using a project as a placeholder
certainly does allow you to build the projects up in terms of a standard set
of libraries.

I also like the fact that this configuration is then stored in source control
as well.

If you mark this bug as 'invalid' then I'll verify it.
Sounds good to me. Closing then.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hi,
I am using Eclipse with a remote CVS machine (using extssh). I have 
added .classpath and .project to the cvsignore file of my repository (In the 
module CVSROOT). But Eclipse seem to keep adding .classpath to the repository 
(and not .project for some reasons).

I have tested this using the plain cvs command and it's working fine. We are, 
for now, using local .cvsignore.

    <WithStack>Code Assist proposals are reflected as an Image and Text.  The images that are
used in the JDT proposals are generated by
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.ResultCollector.  Though it makes use of
the JavaElementImageProvider.getFieldImageDescriptor() to get the proper image
for a particular IJavaElement, it does perform additional consideration for
elements like static, deprecated, Local variable etc.

We are interested to contribute to code assist by way of reusing the images (and
semantics) that are in use by the (internal) ResultCollector.
Do you expect that the collector gets public API or flags/API to get the images
for the content assist?
We are generating/reuse codeAssist proposals, and would like to provide the same
semantics as does the ResultCollector when it comes to assigning images to
proposals elements (see attached image).   The JavaElementImageProvider gives us
image mapping for regular IJavaElement kind of things, but it lacks the
additional semantics the ResultCollector provides for locals, deprecation etc.

We ask for a complete public support in JavaElementImageProvider.

Martin, you are the master of JavaPluginImages and also wrote most of that
ResultCollector.

I agree that it makes sense to offer clients a way to get the same images for
content assist proposals as we have. I see two choices: either we add yet
another flag or we provide a new class for accessing the content assist proposal
images.

Feel free to move back after commenting if you think this is now in Jdt Text area.
ResultCollector is not likely to become public API. It is just too closely
connected to the Java editor. 
The idea is to offer all images in 'ISharedImages' and let you (other plugins)
write something like the JavaElementImageProvider yourself for your kind of
elements. This gives you the most flexibility and us less API to maintain.

I see that we are not providing the field and local variable images and also
missing most of the inner type images. I will add that to ISharedImages.

I'll have a look if it would be good to have methods like
'getMethodImageDescriptor(boolean isInInterface, int flags)' in 'ISharedImages'
as well.

In fact we could rewrite JavaElementImageProvider to use the constants in
'ISharedImages' to see if we're offering enough in the API.

Let me know if that makes sense to you.

Yes.  It makes a lot of sense.

    <WithOutStack>Code Assist proposals are reflected as an Image and Text.  The images that are
used in the JDT proposals are generated by
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.ResultCollector.  Though it makes use of
the JavaElementImageProvider.getFieldImageDescriptor() to get the proper image
for a particular IJavaElement, it does perform additional consideration for
elements like static, deprecated, Local variable etc.

We are interested to contribute to code assist by way of reusing the images (and
semantics) that are in use by the (internal) ResultCollector.
Do you expect that the collector gets public API or flags/API to get the images
for the content assist?
We are generating/reuse codeAssist proposals, and would like to provide the same
semantics as does the ResultCollector when it comes to assigning images to
proposals elements (see attached image).   The JavaElementImageProvider gives us
image mapping for regular IJavaElement kind of things, but it lacks the
additional semantics the ResultCollector provides for locals, deprecation etc.

We ask for a complete public support in JavaElementImageProvider.

Martin, you are the master of JavaPluginImages and also wrote most of that
ResultCollector.

I agree that it makes sense to offer clients a way to get the same images for
content assist proposals as we have. I see two choices: either we add yet
another flag or we provide a new class for accessing the content assist proposal
images.

Feel free to move back after commenting if you think this is now in Jdt Text area.

When JETEmitter creates the .JETEmitters project, the "src" and "runtime"
folders are created without checking if they exist:

(line 272-273)

project.getFolder(new Path("src")).create(false, true, new SubProgressMonitor
(progressMonitor, 1));
project.getFolder(new Path("runtime")).create(false, true, new 
SubProgressMonitor(progressMonitor, 1));

Suggested fix:
Check if each folder exists before creating them.

IFolder src = project.getFolder(new Path("src"));
if (!src.exists()) {
  src.create(false, true, new SubProgressMonitor(progressMonitor, 1));
}
IFolder runtime = project.getFolder(new Path("runtime"));

    <WithStack>As the build now provides more flexibility through a few new properties, I 
think it could worth trying to surface those in a global preference page so 
that the user does not have to set it for every build.xml it writes

Here are the properties.
	javacFailOnError
	javacDebugInfo
	javacVerbose
	javacSource
	javacTarget
Pascal, do you have setters on your generators that I could set these values, 
as entered by the user?
There are no setters for those values.
We do not want the values for those variables to be hardcoded in the script.

The idea I had in mind when I open this bug, was to automatically set the 
values in the properties of the launch for the build.xml.
Pascal, it would be great if you could provide a short description for each 
property, as I'm not sure what some of them do.  I'll use the descriptions in 
the preference page that I will create for these settings.  Thanks.
javacFailOnError : Indicates whether the build will continue even if there are 
compilation errors; defaults to true. 
javacDebugInfo : Indicates whether source should be compiled with debug 
information.
javacVerbose : Asks the compiler for verbose output.
javacSource : Determines the source code format. Legal values are 1.3 and 1.4.
javacTarget : Generate class files for specific VM version. Note that the 
default value depends on the JVM that is running Ant.
Thanks Pascal.
One more thing though.  You mention that javacFailOnError defaults to true; 
however, in the generated scripts that I'm looking at, the value is "false" by 
default.  Which should the correct default value be?
You are right, it is false. I copied the Ant doc a bit too fast :-)
Remove the last part of the comment.
Done.
Will be in tomorrow's I-build.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>It appears that on Windows the Table class always allocates a small border,
with a width equal to the value of OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CXEDGE), 
whether you explicitly set a border or not. If you don't set a border then 
the actual physical border is equal to this value. If you set a border 
then this value has to be added to the reported value.

The current implementation of getBorderWidth(), inherited from the Control
class, doesn't take this into account. This results id that the preferred 
size of the Table is being slightly underestimated, which causes unwanted 
scrollbars. 

Here's a test case that shows the problem:

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Display display = new Display();
        Shell shell = new Shell(display);
        shell.setText("Broken Table Border?");

        Table table = null;

        String mode = args[0];
        if("current".equals(mode))
        {
          // this will have an unwanted vertical scrollbar
          table = new Table(shell, SWT.NONE);
        }
        else if("proposed_noborder".equals(mode))
        {
          table = new ProposedFixTable(shell, SWT.NONE);
        }
        else if("proposed_border".equals(mode))
        {
          table = new ProposedFixTable(shell, SWT.BORDER);
        }

        new TableItem(table,SWT.NONE).setText("ReallyReallyLongTableItem1");
        new TableItem(table,SWT.NONE).setText("ReallyReallyLongTableItem2");
        new TableItem(table,SWT.NONE).setText("ReallyReallyLongTableItem3");

        table.setSize(table.computeSize(100, SWT.DEFAULT));

        shell.pack();
        shell.open();

        while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
            if (!display.readAndDispatch())
                display.sleep();
        }
        display.dispose();

    }

    static public class ProposedFixTable extends Table
    {

      public ProposedFixTable(Composite parent, int style)
      {
        super(parent, style);
      }

      protected void checkSubclass () {}

      public int getBorderWidth ()
      {
        int borderWidth = super.getBorderWidth();
        borderWidth += OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CXEDGE)/2;
        return borderWidth;
      }
    }
Doesn't seem like the right fix to lie about border width so it can be called 
from computeSize() (unless of course, the actual physical border, when 
measured with a pixel measuring tool is "super.getBorderWidth + 
OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CXEDGE)/2" pixels wide)

OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CXEDGE)/2; doesn't work for some xp theme 
like 'plus! da vinci'.



I've dug a little deeper into this problem and think I understand it now.
Not sure what the correct fix is though.

Take a table with a border, 3 rows and a horizontal scrollbar. Also, set
the lines visible. The height returned by this call in the computeSize
method:

OS.SendMessage (handle, OS.LVM_APPROXIMATEVIEWRECT, -1, bits);

is 58. By taking a screen capture and blowing up the pixels I found that
the scrollbar is 16 pixels high. The table item height is reported as 14
pixels, so this 58 must be 3*14 + 16 = 58. The table computeSize method
adds 2*border to the height, where border is reported as 2 pixels (which
is correct for a raised border, as confirmed by examining the screen 
capture). So, the preferred height, as returned by computeSize, is 62 
pixels. However, setting the table to this height gives an unwanted 
vertical scrollbar. By experimentation I found that adding 2 pixels to 
the height got rid of the scrollbar, and now I think I understand why.

If you examine the screen capture you'll see that there's a single pixel
high line above the topmost row. I don't know why it's there, but this 
accounts for 1 extra pixel. The other extra pixel is needed to show the
bottom line of the bottom row. This is the old fence/fencepost issue. 
The actual interior pixels of a row, by examination of the screen capture, 
is 13 pixels. Each row has space for a single pixel line at top and bottom.
The row height reported  by the table is 14 pixels, interior plus top, 
or bottom, line. The height of n rows is therefore 14*n + 1, not 14*n.
So, the correct height is:

 1(extra top line) + (14*3 + 1)(rows) + 16(h_scroll) + 2*2(border) = 64

Setting the height to this value gets rid of the scrollbar.

The reason I proposed adding OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CXEDGE) was that
even when no border is set this call returns 2, which is the number of 
missing pixels. Maybe this is just coincidence. Also, I'm sure that all
of these calculations go out of the window when you use certain XP themes.
So, not sure what the correct general fix is, but it was fun getting to 
the bottom of the problem.

Screen capture of table

This screen capture of a table with no scrollbars (height set with 2 extra
pixels added) illustrates the issues I described in my previous comment.
I see. But in your test case the computeSize of Table is not including the 16 
pixels of the scrollbar cause the hHint is different than SWT.DEFAULT. Look at 
the implementation of computeSize, at end:
if (((style &amp; SWT.H_SCROLL) != 0) &amp;&amp; (hHint != SWT.DEFAULT)) {
	height += OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CYHSCROLL);
}
This code fails cause the hHint used is not wide enough and force the 
horizontal scrollbar to show. But the scrollbar height is not included in the 
total height.

Note: LVM_APPROXIMATEVIEWRECT does not consider the space for the vertical 
scrol (as it says in the java comment at end of computeSize).
it returns: (numberOfItems * itemHeight) + (itemHeight + 2).

this can be verified by setting different fonts (with different height) in the 
table and running the test case.

    <WithStack>From bug 37943:
"Checkout project as", which we MUST be able to use, allows you to checekout 
the a CVS project to any location/folder you choose.  We have a build.xml in 
the root of the project folder tree.  So we must be able to reference the 
build.xml relative to where the project is placed, not the workspace.


The .project file contains contains a project specific path to 
the .externalToolsBuilder folder.  This path should be project relative.
Making sure I understand the issue here...

Reading this comment in the context of Bug 37943, it sounds like the request is 
to expand the ${project_loc} variable inside the context of an external tool 
builder to mean the project enclosing the builder.

This seems like a separate issue from the way we store the handle to the launch 
in the .project file, right?
I think they are separate issues.

Re-reading this, since external tool builders are project specific I don't see 
how having a project specific path can be harmful here? 
But at the same time I don't see any reason that the path for the external tool 
builder launch file can't be project relative.
The .project's path to the .externalToolsBuidler folder must be specified 
relative to $project_loc.  Otherwise, "Checkout Project As" will be trying to 
use the externalToolBuilder folder from eclipse/workspace/&lt;default CVS module 
name&gt; instead of from eclipse/workspace/$project_loc
We store the memento that we get from the launch configuration.
Then there may be bugs here in the debug framework.
We need to do some testing with the workflow that P Duffy is using.
If you checkout the org.eclipse.ant.core project as "Ant Core" (or some other 
name) and go to the External Tool Builders for the project, it displays "Invalid 
External Tool Builder".

This should be an issue for anyone who called ILaunchConfiguration#getMemento() 
on a config stored in a project.
For our purposes, at least, we know that external tool builders are always 
stored inside the .externalToolBuilders folder. So we should be able to 
manipulate the memento to store a project-relative path and then rebuild the 
correct memento when we want to get the config.

    <WithStack>The eclipse help system running on iSeries needs to support WAS as well as 
Tomcat.  The memory footprint for running both application servers is too great 
on the iSeries platform.
It is not clear to me what your requirement is.  What is your usage scenario 
that you are trying to solve with specific installation/configuration?

Eclipse supports both (and more servers).  It runs embedded an embedded 
Tomcat, but you can contribute a another plugin providing Appserver 
functionality and it will be used _instead_.  See 
org.eclipse.help.appserver.server extension point.  Eclipse being open source, 
cannot provide WAS specific implementation of a plugin.


Tomcat in Eclipse can be replaced by another server implementation, so 
essentially this bug has been fixed long, ago.

There is no response whether this bug concerns totally different problem, but 
there exists a plan item bug 37714, that I think this bug is a duplicate of.  
The bug 37714 goes beyond enabling Tomcat to be replaced with another server, 
and the bug has iSeries point of view presented.  I will mark this as a 
duplicate then.  Please continue the discussions in the plan item bug to 
identify the issues and possible solution regarding WAS and Tomcat.

    <WithStack>The javadoc for #openDialogBox() does not say how to indicate that 
the dialog box was canceled. 
The de-facto behaviour is that if null is returned, it is considered 
as "cancel".
I assume you mean the method declaration in class DialogCellEditor?
yes
Clarified the spec for openDialog as follows:
/**
 * Opens a dialog box under the given parent control and returns the
 * dialog's value when it closes, or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if the dialog
 * was cancelled or no selection was made in the dialog.

 * @return the selected value, or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if the dialog was 
 *   cancelled or no selection was made in the dialog
 */

I'm viewing this as a spec clarification, not a breaking API change, since 
callers would have already had to handle null.</WithStack>

Description:
The panel "Select Folder" that is displayed when we click on "Folder" button is 
partially in English. Several fields, words are
in English, like: "Folders","Selection" and "Cancel" button.

See attached images as example.

Steps to recreate:
1. Windows -&gt; Preferences
2. Expand Workbench, click in Linked Resources
3. Click on New... button
4. In New Variable panel, click on "Folder" button
5. The panel with problem is displayed.

The window that is being talked about is the SWT DirectoryDialog.  Reassigning 
the report to SWT for comment and copying VI.
The DirectoryDialog is a native dialog.  In order to see the text in the 
correct language, you must make sure your locale is correctly configured.  SWT 
does not provide the strings displayed on these buttons and there is therefore 
nothing to NLS on our part.


*** Bug 38269 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Lynne, it looks like you have looked into this.  Am assigning it back to you 
as you have more context than I do.

Can this be closed? If not then it needs to be resolved for 2.1.1.
Closing.  As indicated in comment #5, the locale has to be installed 
correctly.  If the locale is installed correctly, but the strings are still not 
showing up correctly, this is a platform problem and any solution will have to 
be provided by SWT, not Platform UI.  
Should add the following to the readme for 2.1.1 and 3.0.
Pending confirmation from Cam as to whether this is also still a problem on 
Windows.

Missing translations for certain dialogs under GTK
You may find the translations of some dialogs such as File selection, Folder 
selection, New Folder, Delete, rename , etc... partially translated when 
running the NLS versions of eclipse or  Websphere Studio Workbench on GTK 2.0.6 
or GTK 2.2. These screen selections are coming from GTK, not eclipse or the 
workbench. For further information, please refer to this web site: 
http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/. Gnome Bug 114658 was crested to 
report this problem. 

Reopening because the PR is not invalid...
... it's a problem with the OS.
Added this to 2.1.1 release notes:

Missing translations for certain OS dialogs (Linux GTK only)

OS dialogs for selecting files or folders are only partially translated on GTK 
2.0.6 or GTK 2.2. These dialogs and the untranslated messages come from GTK, 
not from Eclipse. This is a known bug in GTK. (bug 38248)

I am unclear as to why a bug report was filed against Gnome.

I have logged into RedHat 9.0 Gnome with simplified chinese and the FileDialog
is correct - all strings provided by the OS are translated.  If the locale is
correctly set, GTK+ does the right thing.
We are using RedHat 8.0 with GTK 2.2., not RedHat 9.0.  Please contact Tod 
Creasey for more information.  This is the level of GTK that we use for all our 
DBCS testing and TVT.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When you try to create an external tool project builder, an NPE
occurs. The problem appears to be that while creating the contents
of the refresh tab, we end up trying to validate the launch config.
But this happens before the contents have been fully created, so
we get an NPE when we try to access the working set component.

I don't know what's recently changed to cause this.

Here's the stack trace:
Thread [main] (Suspended (breakpoint at line 233 in ExternalToolsBuilderTab))

Occurs only on the latest code not in the build.
The ResourceComponent was doing an unnecessarily early update of the resource 
list.

Please verify.
There's also a problem with the launch dialog framework. The dialog and the tab 
viewer keep track of an "initializing tabs" state. However, this should only be 
maintained/checked in the tab viewer. 
Fixed. Moved "initializing tabs" state to tab viewer, and only check the state 
from the tab viewer.
Please verify, Jared.

Test case #: 02.38400 

Description: In some panes, the mnemonic keys (control assist) does not 
function correctly. For example, in the Ant Editor pane, Alt+w can work, 
meaning when I click Alt+w, the 'Show print margin' check box will be selected, 
if click Alt+w again, it will be unchecked. But some mnemonic keys such as 
Alt+e, Alt+r, Alt+g can't work correctly. 

Steps to recreate problem: 
1. click Window -&gt; Preferences. 
2. In the left pane, expand Ant and select Editor. 
3. In the right pane, click the Appearance tab
4. Attempt to use the keys

Comments:
-NOTE that this occurs for US English and is not a TVT specific problem
-This does not occur for Windows.
Should consider for 2.1.1
Removing the TVT listing as this is not an nl problem
this is not a key bindings issue. moving to SWT.
Hwa, can you explain it better ?
What do you mean by 'Attempt to use the keys' ?
For me, all the mnemonic are working correctly in this page: alt+w, alt+r, 
alt+e, alt+g. The Tab key is also working fine.

There was another bug about mnemonic failing in the preference page, see 
Bug#31009.

Tod, can you make this fail and show Felipe?
adding Tod to the CC list.

When I say attempt, I mean to use the mnemonic keys for that page.  Sorry for 
the unclarity.
Hwa, this works for me on build M20030613 (2.1.1).
Could you test this again on eclipse RC2 (2.1.1) and M1 (HEAD).

I'm pretty sure this was fixed by Bug#31009. I don't know which version of 
eclipse is used by wswb 20030528 but you should not see this bug anymore.

This works for me as well.  Thanks Felipe.
I closing this bug then.

    <WithStack>Eclipse 2.1.1 build M20030528

Selecting a method in the Java Package Explorer does not scroll 
the open Java editor to show that method. It did in 2.1, so this
is something that changed between 2.1 and this 2.1.1 build.
The current behavior is not an improvement, since it now
requires a double click on the method to scroll the editor.
Further info: 
I was running with the Workbench &gt; Open mode: Double click (the default).
When I temporarily switched to Workbench &gt; Open mode: Single click,
selections in the Package Explorer now scroll the open editor (and open
a new editor if necessary).
When I then switched back to Workbench &gt; Open mode: Double click,
selections in the Package Explorer still scroll the open editor
(but no longer open new editors). The bug has gone. 
If I shutdown eclipse and restart, everything is working fine when
I restart.

I noticed this problem today when I upgraded from Eclipse 2.1 to this 2.1.1
build and kept the same workspace. This makes me suspect that the
upgraded workspace was in a weird state. I switched back and forth between
2.1.1 and 2.1 a couple of times, and the bug looked reproducable.
It wasn't until I started with Workbench &gt; Open mode that the problem 
went away. I suspect the default setting are the problem. I tried
hitting Restore Defaults, but the problem still hasn't come back.

This was changed to address https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37567.

You can have single click behaviour by either:
1) using the the single click mode 
2) by enabling the link mode.

closing - given the conclusion in bug# 37463.

That is the one are you running ?
CC to investigate.
Can you confirm you are using the release version of Eclipse 2.1? Not Eclipse 
2.01? Or an RC3 build of Eclipse 2.1?
This is bug 34940 which was fixed just before Eclipse 2.1. It is included in

Please let us know!

I'm using eclipse 2.1 v200303272130.
I reinstalled the sun j2sdk 1.4.2-beta-b19 kit on all the three machines and now
I'm not facing the problem reported earlier, i.e., eclipse starts up fine.

That is the one are you running ?
CC to investigate.
Can you confirm you are using the release version of Eclipse 2.1? Not Eclipse 
2.01? Or an RC3 build of Eclipse 2.1?
This is bug 34940 which was fixed just before Eclipse 2.1. It is included in 
Eclipse 2.1 release version, and any build version &gt;v20030324
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34940#c23
Please let us know!
Chris
I'm using eclipse 2.1 v200303272130.
I reinstalled the sun j2sdk 1.4.2-beta-b19 kit on all the three machines and now
I'm not facing the problem reported earlier, i.e., eclipse starts up fine.

    <WithStack>It should be fine to add some features to the Tasks View:
- Save task in CVS repository
- Export task list in formatted text, xml or others.
- Assign an owner to tasks
- Save task in CVS repository (dup of bug 26809)

You can save tasks in the repository by using the java task tags.  Look under
Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Task Tags.  For example, you create a comment like //TODO
and it will show this in the tasks view.

- Export task list in formatted text, xml or others (see bug 21407).

This is also supported.  If you select tasks in the task view, you can copy &amp;
paste into another application such as MS Word.  You can also use drag and drop
to export tasks into a text-based report in Word or WordPad.

- Assign an owner to tasks

deal of extra infrastructure</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Setting the MenuItem text after setting the Menu causes the Menu text to appear
and behave disabled.  This was tested on win2k with all the sp's.  I am running
swt-win32-2133.  Simple example:

Shell shell = new Shell();
Menu menu = new Menu(shell, SWT.BAR);
MenuItem fileItem = new MenuItem(menu, SWT.CASCADE);
Menu fileMenu = new Menu(fileItem);
MenuItem newItem = new MenuItem(fileMenu, SWT.PUSH);
Display display = shell.getDisplay();

//Switch these next two lines and it works fine.
//This however precludes changing the  text at a later time.
fileItem.setMenu(fileMenu);
fileItem.setText("file");
newItem.setText("new");
shell.setMenuBar(menu);
shell.setSize(500, 500);
shell.setVisible(true);
shell.setFocus();

while(!shell.isDisposed()) {
	if(!display.readAndDispatch()) {
		display.sleep();
	}//if//
}//if//

Please let me know if there is a simple way to get around this behavior so that
I can change the menu text at a later point in time after the menu is created.

Thank you...
I just found a quick work around to this bug.  If I simply add:
&lt;code&gt;fileItem.setEnabled(true);&lt;/code&gt; after setting the cascade MenuItem text
the menu becomes useable again.  Seems that this should not be necessary however.
Your test case works for me on Windows Xp/2000/98.
Which menu item is disabled for you ? the cascade one ?

SN to advise.
I believe this a duplicate but can't find the exact bug.  It was a problem in 
Windows that we worked around in SWT.  I'm going to close this as WORKSFORME.  

Wynne, please reopen this problem report if this problem is not fixed for you 
in the latest nightly.  Thanks.</WithStack>

&lt;code&gt;fileItem.setEnabled(true);&lt;/code&gt; after setting the cascade MenuItem text
the menu becomes useable again.  Seems that this should not be necessary however.
Your test case works for me on Windows Xp/2000/98.
Which menu item is disabled for you ? the cascade one ?

SN to advise.
I believe this a duplicate but can't find the exact bug.  It was a problem in 
Windows that we worked around in SWT.  I'm going to close this as WORKSFORME.  

Wynne, please reopen this problem report if this problem is not fixed for you 
in the latest nightly.  Thanks.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>There should be a menu entry to create a basic build.xml that will compile the 
current project (taking into account current project properties such as build 
path etc). 

The template it uses to generate the file should be customisable. 

Possibly there should be several "basic" build.xml menu entries (covering 
different types of projects, such as webapps, ejbs etc).

    <WithStack>When I use the CCombo with the dialog, the dropdown list shown in the back of 
the Dialog.
I did as following.
1. Create one sample application with a Group.
2. The parent of group is one shell.
3. I create a dialog.
4. I put my application to this dialog. and change the Group's parent as the 
dialog's parent.
 Now the above descripbed pbm occured.
I'm not able to reproduce this, could you post a test case ?

Here is how I'm trying to re-create the problem:
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display  display = new Display ();
	final Shell shell = new Shell (display);
	
	final Group group = new Group (shell, SWT.BORDER);
	group.setBounds (30, 30, 200, 200);
	final CCombo ccombo = new CCombo (group, SWT.BORDER);
	ccombo.setItems(new String[] {"a","b","c","d","e",});
	ccombo.setBounds (30, 30, 60, 28);
	
	shell.addListener (SWT.MouseDown, new Listener() {
		public void handleEvent(Event event) {
			Shell dialog = new Shell (shell, SWT.DIALOG_TRIM);
			group.setParent (dialog);
			group.setBounds (30, 30, 200, 200);
			dialog.open();
		}
	});
	shell.open ();
	while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch()) {
			display.sleep ();
		}
	}
	display.dispose ();
}

Here is the Test Case.


It contains two files.
1.Dialog.java
2.ComboPbm.java
Since in our project we are using Dialog.java I use same here.           
      Just run and check it out.
The Drop down list will be behind the Dialog.

        while (!shell.isDisposed()) {

                display.sleep ();
            }
        }
        display.dispose ();
    }
}

I found one temporary solution for this.
This problem occurs because the CCombo create one popup shell.
The Dialog creates one shell.The dialog's shell is created when we call the show
(). So this shell is created after the CCombo popup shell creation.
This makes the popup shell go behind the Dialog's shell.

I add some lines in the CCombo's dropDown(boolean) function.

    boolean parentChanged;//One varaible is added

    void dropDown (boolean drop) {
    
        if (drop == isDropped ()) return;
        if (!drop) {
            popup.setVisible (false);
            text.setFocus();
            return;
        }
    
        int index = list.getSelectionIndex();
        if (index != -1) list.setTopIndex(index);
    
        Rectangle listRect = list.getBounds();
        Point point        = getParent().toDisplay (getLocation ());
        Point comboSize    = getSize();
        int width          = Math.max (comboSize.x, listRect.width + 2);

/*   
 * Starts here
 *
 */
        if (! parentChanged &amp;&amp; !popup.getParent().equals(getShell())) {
    
            parentChanged = true;
            popup.setParent(getShell ());
        }
    
        if (parentChanged) {
    
            Point textPoint = text.toDisplay(text.getLocation());
            point = getShell().toControl(textPoint);
        }
/*
 *  Ends here
 */
        popup.setBounds (point.x, point.y + comboSize.y, width, 
                         listRect.height + 2);
    
        popup.setVisible (true);
        list.setFocus();
    }

But this will create some other problem.
Whenever I click the dropdown down button without seleting any list items,It 
causes the background shell changed which make some fear for the users,but it 
is not affect anything.It works properly.










VI to investigate.

NOTE: The API setParent is not supported on all platforms.

There are currently many limitations of the setParent API.  The fact that 
child shells do not get reparented properly is what is being demonstrated here.

The fix is to create the popup shell just before it is to be shown and destroy 
it when it closes.  This will solve the reparenting problem.
If we fix in this manner than we need to face some other problem.Because This 
use the list in most fns.If we dispose it it will crate some other problem.

Can u give me the full details abt your fix?
Please feel free to modify the Severity of the bug report but the Priority is 
used by the development team only.
Creating the popup shell every time is a pain becuase it means we can't use 
the OS to store things such as the item list or the selection.

Reparenting the shell just before opening it is not a good solution because 
the popup Shell will be disposed if the old parent shell gets disposed at any 
time prior to shoowing the list (e.g. create CCombo in shell_1 and then 
reparent to shell_2.  Dispose shell1 without popping down the list.  Then when 
you try to display the list you geta Widget is Disposed error.)

I think the best solution right now is to create the popup Shell with no 
parent (popup = new Shell(display, SWT.NO_TRIM)).  The problem with this 
solution is that the popup shell will appear in the task bar on Windows.

I am requesting that when a shell is created with the style SWT.NO_TRIM then 
it should not appear in the task bar (on all platforms).  When this is 
provided, I will be able to fix this bug.

See bug 40420.
Fixed.  The popup is created as a top level shell with the ON_TOP style.

popup = new Shell (getDisplay(), SWT.NO_TRIM | SWT.ON_TOP);
This fix caused problems when CCombo appeared in modal dialogs. See bug 65697.

For 3.0 RC2 a different fix has been implemented.
For 3.0 RC2 a different fix has been implemented.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>When I use the CCombo with the dialog, the dropdown list shown in the back of 
the Dialog.
I did as following.
1. Create one sample application with a Group.
2. The parent of group is one shell.
3. I create a dialog.
4. I put my application to this dialog. and change the Group's parent as the 
dialog's parent.
 Now the above descripbed pbm occured.
I'm not able to reproduce this, could you post a test case ?

Here is how I'm trying to re-create the problem:
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display  display = new Display ();
	final Shell shell = new Shell (display);
	
	final Group group = new Group (shell, SWT.BORDER);
	group.setBounds (30, 30, 200, 200);
	final CCombo ccombo = new CCombo (group, SWT.BORDER);
	ccombo.setItems(new String[] {"a","b","c","d","e",});
	ccombo.setBounds (30, 30, 60, 28);
	
	shell.addListener (SWT.MouseDown, new Listener() {
		public void handleEvent(Event event) {
			Shell dialog = new Shell (shell, SWT.DIALOG_TRIM);
			group.setParent (dialog);
			group.setBounds (30, 30, 200, 200);
			dialog.open();
		}
	});
	shell.open ();
	while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch()) {
			display.sleep ();
		}
	}
	display.dispose ();
}

Here is the Test Case.

    <WithStack>Create a global Ant preference to allow the setting of the default VM for Ant

The global setting can be overridden by the per configuration setting
We need to work with Java debug to come up with a better story for reuse of the 
JavaJRETab. The JavaJRETab has its own set of problems (needs to be more like 
the InstalledJRE preferencepage).

In Ant land we need to determine the definition of default:
The VM set to build the project?

Pushing back to M3
I'm wondering if we need an more support that is currently available in 3.0M2. 
Currently you can "run in the same VM", or choose a specific (alternate, 
seperate) VM. The default behavior is to run in the same VM.

Will it be "too complex" to have the following options:
(1) Use default VM (which is controlled by global pref - may be same VM, may be 
alternate)
(2) Use alternamte VM (choose from drop-down)

The current implementation provides all the function. The only drawback is that 
is is inefficient (in user configuration/number of clicks), if you always want 
to use a certain (seperate) VM. Also inefficient if you want to change how all 
your 'default' scripts run - i.e. set them all to use the default VM, and then 
change the VM via a global preference.

Comments? (I'm not sure we know what the common use case is)
I have heard from users that they want to easily be able to specify that all 
Ant builds occur in a specific separate VM.
I am hesitant to redefine what "default VM" means in Ant land. I think of the 
default VM as the same VM as Eclipse.
Did not make it for M3
*** Bug 46743 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
From M5 on Ant builds will by default occur in a separate VM (see bug 45899).
As such I am lowering the priority on this one and moving to M6 for further 
consideration.
Since we are focusing on bug fixes for M6 I am moving this to M7
Nothing more planned for 3.0
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

Since we are focusing on bug fixes for M6 I am moving this to M7
Nothing more planned for 3.0
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

    <WithStack>Subclassing the ZoomComboContributionItem

The comment for the fill method suggests that we override createControl to 
subclass.  However, the combo control is private instead of protected, and 
toolItem, which may be used by a createControl that we subclass is private 
instead of protected.

refresh() doesn't have a modifier so it can be subclassed only from that 
package.  Making combo, toolItem, and refresh() protected would be helpful, as 
well as possibly the handleWidget methods.
What are you trying to do?  Combo cannot be made available because we may be 
forced to use a CCombo in the future, due to how crappy Motif's Combo is.
Hi, Randy.  I was trying to add descriptive text items to the zoom combo such 
as zoom in and zoom out.
AFAIK, This can be done entirely in the ZoomManager implementation.  The 
ZoomCombo... only uses getZoomAsText, getZoomLevelsAsText, and setZoomAsText.

So, if your manager returns a string called "Zoom In", then choosing that will 
result in manager.setZoomAsText("Zoom In"). Don't forget that the strings will 
be translated.

I don't think putting "zoom in" and "zoom out" on the combo makes sense.  They 
are Actions, not a choice. So, choosing the "zoom in" choice does not result in 
a consistent zoom setting, but a different one each time.

Visio and Word don't have such actions on their zoom combos.  They do have "fit 
to page" and other choices, which could be done same way. These types of 
choices do give the same results each time (assuming the window isn't resized).
I agree with you completely that the additional zoom in and zoom out can be 
implemented in ZoomManager.  However, making getZoomLevelsAsText return those 
additional strings is strange, as you point out that these are actions.  This 
is why I subclassed ZoomComboContributionItem.

How about at least making toolItem protected?
FIT_PAGE, and other textual actions were added in 2.1.2 without any change 
needed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The tools.jar entry on the Ant runtime classpath is not updated when the user 
specifies to run in a separate VM.
We should add the Xerces JARs as well.
Moving to M3
See bug 38815 as well.

The JRE tab for Ant now has an Update button. This updates the classpath based 
on the JRE that the user has selected.
Please verify DarinW.
To me, it's confusing to know when to use the "Update" button.

(1) When I select an alternate JRE, and the classpath tab says "use default", 
and I press the update button what happens? (does the "use default" get de-
selected, and tools.jar get added?)

Perhaps we need a better classpath page... the meaning of "use default" might 
depend on what JRE is selected? (I need to understand this better).
Question 1) the answer is yes. When you go back to the classpath page , use 
global will no longer be selected, and the correct tools.jar will be added to 
the classpath which is now launch configuration specific.
Did not work when using an alternate JDK. I specified jdk1.4.1 which contains a 
tools.jar, and pressed Update - nothing happened. (Need to re-think this 
classpath stuff).
In fact, I don't think we should need an "update" button (the classpath should 
auto-update if it's set to be "default"). If it's not default, then it's up to 
the user to change it.

I want to look into using a regular java classpath tab for this feature, with 
a "classpath provider".
The Ant classpath does not have the same notion of default classpath. The 
launch config makes use of the global classpath (which the user can happily 
change) or overrides and provides its own.

The whole reason I attempted this is that the user has no idea what to 
update..thus the dozens of posts on the news group that Ant does not work 
because tools.jar is missing.

Looks like I just made things more complicated :-(
Moving to M4
Initial re-work released. Created a new AntClasspathTab2 that uses the same 
classpath infrastructure as the JavaClasspathTab. The classpath is saved using 
the Java Application configuration format (memento of runtime classpath 
entries). The default classpath is computed by the 
AntClasspathProvider. "Container" entries now exist for ANT_HOME 
and "Additional Tasks &amp; Support". The contents of these containers is computed 
dynamically at launch time. "Tools.jar" is a child of the addition support 
entry, and is computed to match the JRE being used.

TODO:
* Remove unused code
* Mark targets tab dirty when required (wasn't sure when to do this)
For the configs it works for (including new ones), it looks great.

There must be some issues with moving older configs forward?
I am getting a lot of my configurations showing a Classpath that only has a 
User Entries entry. Under that entry, there is a Project folder and under that 
is another Project folder? This all claims to be the default classpath.

As well the Ant runtime preference page will need to be reworked to be 
consistent (or is that in a separate bug?)

Other thoughts: do we really need the top level User Entries?
* Config Migration: doesn't work. The classpath format has changed (could 
enter a bug to provide migration - i.e. if old attributes are present, reset 
the classpath)
* Reworking the pref page: should be a new bug (feature)
* Top level "User Entries": if we want to remove it, we can't re-use the java 
classpath model, but likely do-able.
I added configuration migration to be more friendly. A config is migrated the 
first time it is opened in the tab or launched. I maintain the ANT_HOME 
setting, but ignore any other "custom classpath" settings (you get the 
specified ANT_HOME, and a default classpath).
Fixed. I've entered bugs to cover migration issues and pref page issue (bug 
53686 and bug 53688). I suggest to leave "User Classes" as the root node in 
the tab unless we get complaints - it maximizes our re-use.
Please verify (I removed the old AntClasspathTab, and renamed the new 
AntClasspathTab2 to "AntClasspathTab").
When I change the designated JRE, the tools.jar entry is not updated.
and it is not resolved correctly at runtime.
Hmmm. Works for me.
My test case:
Create a brand new Ant launch configuration
Set the buildfile
Go to the JRE tab
Set to a 1.3.1 VM
Go to the classpath tab
Still shows the 1.4.2 tools.jar in the Additional Tasks &amp; Support
Still works for me :-)
???
Is all the code released :-)
The tools.jar was not updated if there was no global tools.jar.
Fixed in ContributedClasspathEntriesEntry.

    <WithStack>Currently, if a source lookup path is changed after launching, the launched 
source locator will not reflect the change (since it does not listen for 
changes). Issue: should we support update of source lookup paths after 
launching, and whose responsibility is it (i.e. the source locator, or the 
source lookup tab...)?

Should there be a dispose method on the source locator? When would it be called 
(on termination or removal from launch view?)

When a feature with a disabled optional child feature is updated to a new 
version, the disabled state of the child is not preserved (the child comes up 
enabled).

Expectation: child state should be preserved and it should be upgraded to a 
new version but remain disabled.
Fixed.
The original uncofigured features are passed to the operation,and then, after 
install, the matching installed features will be unconfigured.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>New test scenario, part 3, step F7:

When Root 1.0.1 is repaired (search turned 1.0.1 even though it was already 
installed because there were updates to the optional features), Root 1.0.1 is 
disabled.

Expectation: since previous and current features in pending operations are the 
same id and version, we should not disable previous (I guess this is what 
happened). Check with the old code to see if/how we handle this special case.
I was wondering why we don't show just the update for the optional feature 
(xyz), not the root. Since root 1.0.1 is already installed (with a missing 
feature), I'd expect that when I search for new updates I should be just 
getting the xyz 1.0.1 in the results list, not root 1.0.1 again.

For the time being, I will investigate the problem as reported, but we should 
perhaps consider the above proposal as well.
Fixed.

In InstallOperation I added the check for reinstall:

		boolean reinstall = false;
		if (oldFeature != null
			&amp;&amp; feature.getVersionedIdentifier().equals(
				oldFeature.getVersionedIdentifier()))
			reinstall = true;

When reinstall==true, all the non-install related tasks (unconfig, ensure 
uniqueness, etc.) are not performed. This is similar to the old 
NewUpdatesWizard.
Just curious - is there a reason why the original code in the InstallWizard was 
not fully migrated?
I have refactored the code from our own "unified" wizards, and I thought it was 
you who did the migration from the original wizards.</WithStack>

Steps to recreate:
1- Click on "Window" -&gt; "Preferences"

Does the "Description" field in the "Edit Template" panel need to be translated?
Created attachment 5013
The "Description" field in the "Edit Template" is not translated
We should support that these descriptions can be translated. The same problem 
shows up in the templates preferences page for the template descriptions. 

The fix for the problem is to use the same "look aside" technique as we use for 
the plugin.xml (keys starting with % are looked-up in a properties file). 

The fix is straighforward and we can provide a fix for 2.1.1.

Code is OK for 2.1.1
Given the fact that the default template now has to be manually maintained
(before we could edit the templates on the preference page, save and then rename
the generated template to the default template) some support would be nice, e.g.
a dev-only button on the preference page that lets us store the default template.

    <WithStack>I am using the color editor 0.2.8 written by Chris Grindstaff.  I modified the 
source to make the editor autowrap.  However, it seems when I am editting a 
particularly long line, I cannot delete characters at the end of line that is 
wrapped.  If I move forward to the next character (on the next line) I can 
backspace without a problem.

Hey David, can you post an example code using only SWT that shows the problem ? 
I think you can reproduce this just with a StyledText and your code to autowrap 
lines. 
Sorry, I have never really done any programming with SWT. Where can I get a
simple StyledText example to play with?

Verified the problem.  Run the attached test case.  Place the cursor at the end

Problem also exists in 2.0.2, so it was not introduced by any 2.1 changes.  
Knut, can you have a look.  I am also unable to place the cursor at the 
beginning of a visual line via a mouse click.
Also:
-place the caret at the beginning of the second visual line 
-press delete
-&gt;the caret jumps to the end of the first visual line. It should have deleted 
the first character of the second visual line. It should do the same when at 
the end of the first visual line since the two positions are the same from a 
logical point of view. It should also jump to the beginning of the second 
visual line (the delete location) when pressing delete at the end of the first 
visual line.
The mouse click at the beginning of a visual line is a known problem. See bug 
24765.
Reassigning to inbox since OTT is taking ownership of StyledText.
This was fixed a long time ago.

    <WithStack>I'd like Eclipse to support a separate Java Build Path for each source folder. 
Most of my unit tests make use of jar files that shouldn't be part of the
regular source build.
Can you be a little more descriptive on your source setup ?

The granularity of a build path is the project. You should consider 
reorganizing your sources into several projects instead.


I have a single project that acts as a client against two versions of a
protocol.  The protocol implementations share the same package, interface and
class names, but have differing parameter signatures and there are other
differences.  The client obviously needs to build against both.  The client has
a great deal of code that is shared between the two versions of the protocol, so
it doesn't make much conceptual sense to have two projects.  Further, having two
sets of identical source for the common code violates one and only once.

Right now, my project is structured so that each client side of the protocol is
in its own package and its own source folder.  That way, I can manually switch
between the two protocol version by editting the build path and changing the
referenced jars, but this is an irritating bit of manual work.

Maybe if there was a way to create sub-projects, this would work.  I could
create a master project that contained all of the common code and a sub-project
for each of the client protocol code.
The latter was actually what I had in mind. Surface your current source folder 
into separate projects, which can then define their own individual classpaths. 
Also projects can be shared individually through source control, and thus 
probably would better fit your needs (protocols are likely evolving at a 
different pace than client code?).
Very good points.  I'll separate these into separate projects and see how well
it works.
Hope it works for you.
Closing then, please reopen if necessary.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Using latest pde.build code from HEAD.
To be able to reproduce it, also get the latest pde ui code from HEAD.  The 
class that generates the feature script is 
org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.feature.BuildFeatureAction.

1. Create a "hello, world" plug-in (com.example.abc)
2. Create another one (com.example.xyz)
3. Create a feature project that includes both plug-ins.
4. Right-click on the feature.xml and select 'Create Ant Build File', you will 
get the exception pasted at the end.

I also noted a change in behavior, which I am not sure if it is a bug or it's 
intentional:
When I am setting the pluginPath on the featureBuildScriptGenerator, the plugin 
paths must now also include the URLs for the feature projects in order for the 
features to be found.  Back in 2.0 pde.build code, the plugin path only 
contained plugin URLs and everything worked fine.  Now, if I don't include the 
feature URLs, I get an error message saying that the feature was not found.

Actually, without self-hosting, if I export the code as jars and run, once 
again I stop at an earlier stage where I get an error saying that the feature 
was not found!!!

Using pde.buildR_3_0early access and compatible pde.ui v20030602_newpdebuild
Fixed in the R3_0_early_access branch
Using R_3_0 branch, I'm still the 'cannot find feature: com.example.feature' 
error.
Use pde.ui (branch R_3_0_newbuild) to reproduce.
It's normal that you get this error because you do not specify the location of 
the feature.xml.
When you do the call to generator.setPluginPath(...) you need to give the 
location of the feature.
I tried doing that too, but it made no difference either.
I'll try it again, but note that we never had to do any of this stuff for 2.1.
Just tried it again, after adding feature.xml to the plugin path, and I still 
get the same error.
Get the latest from R_3_0_newbuild and try it for yourself.
I'm sorry but I can not reproduce the bug with your code.
To make sure you get the correct version of the build code, I tagged it with 
v20030623.
It works fine when you launch a runtime workbench instance.  It did not work 
when I exported the new jars and restarted the development workbench.  The 
reason for that was that I needed to replace the entire pde.build plug-in in 
the install tree, not just pdebuild.jar.  Works fine now.
Code released in HEAD
Don't know if this is related.

First I saw this error message:
Error Jan 14, 2004 03:24:45.964 Cannot find feature:
fi.jab.eclipse.JabEclipseFeature.

And after removing the contents of features/ and plugins/ directories i started
getting NPE.

    <WithStack>It would be nice to be able to select multiple containers via 
IClasspathContainerPage. I have my own implementation of this page for my 
container type that allows selction of container from my own set of 
containers. But we use a lot of them and it would help users if they could 
select multiple ones in one go. 

Unfortunately getSelection() function currently returns a single 
IClasspathEntry without a way of allowing multiple selection without having to 
close and open the dialog again.
Martin, can you please comment.
I have mixed feelings about that. So instead of returning a container you would
like to return multiple containers. What would that mean for editing one of
these containers?
Maybe it would make sense of having a container that contains all the
containers? (not sure if jdt.core supports that)

Correct. Instead of getSelection() returning a single IClasspathEntry I want 
to return an array of them, all to be added to the classpath. 

I also realized that Edit in that case is not as well defined, but you could 
say that any multiple entries returned in "Edit" of a single one just all get 
added/merged into classpath. I.e. you are replacing the single entry you're 
editing with the multiple ones that were selected. It would still be 
impossible to do edit on multiple selection.  You'd have to remove them first. 

I'll understand if you believe that above is not clean and will not be a good 
behavior and refuse to implement it, but before you do read more of my reasons 
below. Its really a usability issue for my users. Perhaps you can suggest an 
alternative.

As far as I can tell there's no support for container inside containers in JDT.

To give you a better idea why I'm asking for this feature I'll describe my 
scenario in more detail. We have a lot of java projects/libraries used by 
different applications. The granularity is similar to plugin, but these are 
not plugins, just external projects/libraries. E.g. xerces, xalan, struts, 
some of our own etc... Each app could easily use a dozen of these. Instead of 
each app hard coding the external jar path for each of these, whic is also 
different on different platforms, I created a custom Classpath container type 
which only knows/stores the "&lt;project&gt;/&lt;version&gt;" about each one that is used. 
Than it resolves this to the proper jars based on the platform and external 
configuration files.

So to configure the new project, a user would have to select a dozen of these 
via the dialog. Doing it one by one is a bit painful, and they've been asking 
for quicker way of doing it. One of the workarounds/backdoors they use 
currently to speed this up is to edit the .classpath directly by copy/paste 
from other already setup projects, but that's not very nice.

I could of course have written my own external dialog that does all this, but 
I'd hate to go around the JDT to do this.

Btw, (but this may need a sepearate bug#) I basically implemented the Jbuilder 
library functionality here, that Jbuilder has built in. [I'm even reusing the 
jbuilder file format, but I hate it and planning to change to my own]. I've 
seen it asked about a couple of times on mailing list/newsgroup. It might be 
something usefull enough to have built-in into JDT.
Or perhaps Edit... just doesn't support returning Multipe entries at all and 
you can only do that from Add...?
If these multiple classpath entries you want to add really have something to do 
together and have a single page to edit them all then they should be expressed 
with a single container.

So in my opinion we should find out if jCore should support containers in 
containers or if you can flatten the list of libraries to avoid that.

Changing getSelection() to return an array seems wrong to me.
Would it help if we allow multiple selection of containers on the container 
selection page and enable the 'OK' button? We could intruduce that container 
can be created without UI or have all the pages in the wizard (you would have 
to press 'next' several times).


Maybe we should make a step 


I could express it as one container but it would be very awkward and 
unnatural. Let me give you an example.

&lt;classpathentry kind="con" path="com.blah.blah.MYCONTAINER/xerces/1.4.3"/&gt;
&lt;classpathentry kind="con" path="com.blah.blah.MYCONTAINER/xalan/2.4.1"/&gt;

These 2 entries tell the system to use jars for Xerces 1.4.3 and Xalan 2.4.1 
from well known locations. They really have nothing to do with each other, 
except the use the same ClassPathEntry type. I'm not sure how I could possibly 
combine this information into one path without looking very weird. And think 
of normal cases when we have 5-10 of these in the project.

Multiple selection of containers wouldn't help at all (at least the way I've 
done this) as I only have one entry there "MY CONTAINER" (besides JRE) which 
then popups a separate selection dialog for all (100s) available 
projects/versions that we have. The selection then adds the appropriate path 
addition to the MY_CONTAINER. And I wouldn't want to convert the 100s of 
library/versions into seperate container types, that doesn't make sense 
really. Is that what you meant?

Does this make sense, what I'm trying to do?

added a new interface 'IClasspathContainerPageExtension2' that allows pages to
return more than one entry. see doc of 'IClasspathContainerPageExtension2' for
details.

currently to speed this up is to edit the .classpath directly by copy/paste 
from other already setup projects, but that's not very nice.

I could of course have written my own external dialog that does all this, but 
I'd hate to go around the JDT to do this.

Btw, (but this may need a sepearate bug#) I basically implemented the Jbuilder 
library functionality here, that Jbuilder has built in. [I'm even reusing the 
jbuilder file format, but I hate it and planning to change to my own]. I've 
seen it asked about a couple of times on mailing list/newsgroup. It might be 
something usefull enough to have built-in into JDT.
Or perhaps Edit... just doesn't support returning Multipe entries at all and 
you can only do that from Add...?
If these multiple classpath entries you want to add really have something to do 
together and have a single page to edit them all then they should be expressed 
with a single container.

So in my opinion we should find out if jCore should support containers in 
containers or if you can flatten the list of libraries to avoid that.

Changing getSelection() to return an array seems wrong to me.
Would it help if we allow multiple selection of containers on the container 
selection page and enable the 'OK' button? We could intruduce that container 
can be created without UI or have all the pages in the wizard (you would have 
to press 'next' several times).


Maybe we should make a step 


I could express it as one container but it would be very awkward and 
unnatural. Let me give you an example.

&lt;classpathentry kind="con" path="com.blah.blah.MYCONTAINER/xerces/1.4.3"/&gt;
&lt;classpathentry kind="con" path="com.blah.blah.MYCONTAINER/xalan/2.4.1"/&gt;

These 2 entries tell the system to use jars for Xerces 1.4.3 and Xalan 2.4.1 
from well known locations. They really have nothing to do with each other, 
except the use the same ClassPathEntry type. I'm not sure how I could possibly 
combine this information into one path without looking very weird. And think 
of normal cases when we have 5-10 of these in the project.

Multiple selection of containers wouldn't help at all (at least the way I've 
done this) as I only have one entry there "MY CONTAINER" (besides JRE) which 
then popups a separate selection dialog for all (100s) available 
projects/versions that we have. The selection then adds the appropriate path 
addition to the MY_CONTAINER. And I wouldn't want to convert the 100s of 
library/versions into seperate container types, that doesn't make sense 
really. Is that what you meant?

Does this make sense, what I'm trying to do?

added a new interface 'IClasspathContainerPageExtension2' that allows pages to
return more than one entry. see doc of 'IClasspathContainerPageExtension2' for
details.

Summary: TVT21: Use of variable makes the string difficult to translate in 
French 

Description: 
The use of a variable in the string makes it hard to translate because i cannot 
know the gender of the noun that will replace that variable. 

Steps to recreate problem: 
1- On the menu bar from the main panel, click Window -&gt; Preferences 
2- In the left pane, expand Ant 
3- Select Runtime 
4- In the right pane, click the Tasks tab 
5- Click the Add Task... 
6- Select the folder org/apache/tools/ant/ or whatever folder that contains 
class files 
7- Select a class file (don't provide a task name) 
8- The string that causes problem should appear at the bottom of the 
window : "A name must be provided for the new task" 


This string in our TM files is : 
"A name must be provided for the new {0}" which makes it hard to translate.

Fixed in rework / refactoring of AddCustomDialog, AntTasksPage and AntTypesPage.
Please verify Jared.
We are currently running TVT and need the fix in 2.1.1 code stream for the
testers to verify. 
We do not intend to fix this in 2.1.1.
In this case the two possibilities are "task" (feminine) and "type" (masculine).
We suggested translating "new" to be: "nouveau(elle)" to indicate the two 
possibilities.
This has been deemed acceptable for 2.1.1.

Verified code.</WithStack>

I think so, see bug 34747

The same issue is seen when defining an action using the actionset extension 
point and creating a corresponding toolbar action using an 
ActionbarContributor. With this setup, the toolbar is updated when the menu

    <WithStack>I am using Eclipse 2.1 GTK on Linux (SuSE 8.2). The IDE does not provide internal HTML 
viewing, so I need to select some external browser. I am not typing in but trying out the 
Browse... button, selecting konquerer (KDE 3.1.1), OK button. Now there is a path showing 
"/opt/kde3/bin/konquerer" %1. Yes, there are double quotation marks around the path but not 
aroung the parameter placeholder. Ok button. Shift-F2. IDE cannot open the browser: 
 
...using browser program ""/opt/kde3/bin/konquerer" %1" has failed. 
 
Yes, there are additional double quotation marks around both, the already quotationed path and 
the parameter placeholder. 
 
When I am erasing the double quotation marks in the place where I can type in the path 
manually, everything works fine. 
 
Seems the IDE tries to put a second pair of quotation marks around the path, what actually is 
wrong.
Thanks.
The problem is documented in 2.1 readme and has already been fixed in 2.1.1 
stream.  See bug 35673 for details.  You can verify using any of the recent 
2.1.1 build (for example M20030530).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I have a file called SillyBean.jardesc in my workspace, that was created by using the Export 
Jar --&gt; Save Description facility. The content looks like this: 
 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; 
&lt;jardesc&gt; 
    &lt;jar path="/home/markus/SillyBean.jar"/&gt; 
    &lt;options overwrite="true" compress="false" exportErrors="false" 
        exportWarnings="true" saveDescription="true" 
        descriptionLocation="/SillyBean/SillyBean.jardesc" 
        useSourceFolders="false" buildIfNeeded="true"/&gt; 
    &lt;manifest manifestVersion="1.0" usesManifest="true" 
        reuseManifest="false" saveManifest="false" 
        generateManifest="false" manifestLocation="/SillyBean/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF"&gt; 
        &lt;sealing sealJar="false"&gt; 
            &lt;packagesToSeal/&gt; 
            &lt;packagesToUnSeal/&gt; 
        &lt;/sealing&gt; 
    &lt;/manifest&gt; 
    &lt;selectedElements exportClassFiles="true" exportJavaFiles="false"&gt; 
        &lt;javaElement handleIdentifier="=SillyBean/src"/&gt; 
    &lt;/selectedElements&gt; 
&lt;/jardesc&gt; 
 
Whenever I try "Open" or "Open In... Jar Description Editor" the file opens in the normal text 
editor. I cannot edit the description, still it is possible to build the jar by "Create Jar". Seems 
that wizard cannot read it's own generated xml files in some circumstances. 
 
I saw this on Eclipse 2.1 on Windows 2000 and SuSE LINUX 8.2 GTK.
&gt;... I cannot edit the description, ...
Why? Is the file read-only? Do you get an exception?

&gt;Open In...
I assume you meant "Open With..." ("Open In..." is not contributed by Eclipse)

If you want to "edit" the JAR description in the wizard you can use "Open JAR
Packager..." just above "Create JAR"

Sorry, I was not clear enough. The problem is that when double clicking the file, a text editor 
opens for manual xml editing of the jardesc file, but I want the Jar Packaging Wizard to be 
opened. I can open that wizard with the menu item "Open Jar Packager", but I want to open it 
with double click. The file is not read only. 
I adapted the summary to your comments.

This is not possible with the current platform support. Only editors can be
linked with a file extension (e.g. .jardesc) and therefore only an editor can be
opened with double click.

If the platform would offer to contribute an "open" delegate then I could open
the wizard on double-click.

Moving to Platform UI for comment.

This is now possible using the 'launcher' attribute.
Fixed in HEAD.

I tried to do the same for the "Open Javadoc Wizard..." action, but that one is not so easy, so I filed bug 247144.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Sometimes JCP Expert Groups (e. g. JTA, JSR88 and others) publish their classes not as 
JARs but ZIPs, also publish the javadocs as ZIPs. It would be great to be able to tell eclipse 
that a source variable is a ZIP and attach docs to the ZIP as it is already possible with JARs. 
Also it would be great to tell eclipse that the docs are in a ZIP file and not in a plain directory.
Libraries and source attachments support both JAR and ZIP format (Classpath 
entries can take both).

Moving to JDT/UI for the doc question.
Martin,

can you please comment.

*** Bug 116678 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This is not high priority for us, but could be implemented by someone in the community.
This feature would be a great addition to Eclipse... there are many situations where this would speed up my workflow (and reduce the possibility of bugs).
