    <WithStack>To quickly enable and disable a set of builders, we have found that users want 
to have separate enable and disable buttons.
Why not use a check box list? (Don't let the check marks change on builders 
that cannot be disabled - grey them out as checked).
We could take the checkbox approach, but it will probably require rewriting a 
lot of the BuilderPropertyPage. It's currently implemented using an SWT Table.
While implemeting the multi-select behavior, I went ahead and added the two 
separate buttons. If we want to change the UI to a checkbox tree viewer, we can 
open a new bug report.

I don't recommend this approach, though, simply because I don't think it's worth 
the effort.

Please verify enable/disable buttons.
Nls was a little screwy and the mneumonics were dupliated.
Verified.
I must of missed your update to the properties file...I am still not sure I 
like the new team stuff...</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In 3.0M2
If you select the following code (up to the very last character) and ask 
for "extract method" you'll get an error dialog indication "Selection ends 
inside a comment" 

foo();//a comment
The problem is that the scanner contains the newline characters (/n/r ....) in
the length of the line comment.

Moving to JDT/Core to comment on the rational to contain newline characters in
line comments.
In fact, new line is not in comment... this is current way to check it which is
not correct.
Scanner current position (got with #getCurrentScannerEndPosition()) after having
parsed a line comment is set after new line characters. But, comment stored
position does not include them (ie. ends at first line character '\r').
So, the only issue here is that you're missing a way to get this correct line
comment end...

Note that this happens also in 2.1.3
Back to JDT/UI.
I will open a new bug against JDT/Core component and put this bug as dependent.
Then, you'll have a track to modify CommentAnanlyser as soon as new API will be
available...

Thanks Frederic.
I cannot reproduce using 3.3 RC4...
Do you know how this issue was fixed without the new API on IScanner (see bug 81784)?

'Refactor &gt; Extract method' works with 3.8 M3. However, 'Extract to method' proposal is not offered with Ctrl+1.

Fix to go in QuickAssistProcessor.getExtractMethodProposal(...). The "if (coveringNode instanceof Block)" statement looks wrong, it might be better to just create the refactoring and let it handle all the cases.

I will investigate.

The 'Extract to Method' quick assist was not offered most of the times when more than one statement was selected! Small bug in getIndex(..) method used by the if statement which I have fixed. The if statement by itself is a cheap test before we create the refactoring, hence I have left it as is. I have also added a few basic tests for the quick assist, there were none previously.

    <WithStack>I copied a workspace that I created with M2 into the eclipse-SDK-I20030806-macosx-
carbon.tar.gz build and started Eclipse. I had three java projects and two simple projects in the 
workspace. I noticed that the Navigator was displaying only the java projects (although the java 
Package Explorer displayed them all(!)).

To see if only the old simple projects failed to display, I tried creating a new simple project. It too 
was not visible in the Navigator (but was in the Package Explorer).
Hm... The situation is even odder than that. I continued working for a while, and then noticed that 
now only one project was visible in the Navigator, and it was one of the *simple* projects.

I'm not sure what is going on at this point. It's possible that there may be some odd interaction 
between the concurrency work, the fact that the repository that contained some of the projects 
was not accessible, and the navigator changes. In any case, it appears that this drop is not usable 
for me. 
I created three Java projects and two simple projects with M2. They all show up 
fine in the Navigator with the 20030806 build. Tested this on Windows though.
Do you still have the workspace that causes trouble with the 0806 build? Can 
you put it somewhere so I can download it?
I do not have the workspace. I will try to recreate the problem case, if I get a chance. The 
workspace I was running had background sync turned on, and a couple of the projects (one java 
one simple) were in a repository that was not accessible. If you can't make the case happen on a 
Mac either, then I'd be willing to believe the problem was related to that.
On the Mac, I loaded three Java projects and two simple projects from the repository 
using the M2 build.
I ran the same workspace using the 20030806 build, disconnected the network cable (-&gt;
inaccessible repository), enabled background synchronization (set to one minute refresh 
interval) and the workspace content is still displayed fine in the Navigator.
Can I close this PR?
Since I haven't seen the problem re-appear, and could not make it happen with the few attempts I 
tried, you might as well close it. I'll re-open if it happens again.
Reopen if needed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In the eclipse-SDK-I20030806-macosx-carbon.tar.gz build, I got an error in a CVS background 
job. The Progress view appeared, and I selected the error and picked Delete in the context menu. 
At this point, the error indicator went grey, since no other jobs were running.

However, now whenever a new job runs, the progress indicator draws in red, even though there are 
no new errors visible in the Progress view.

If I select "Clear All Errors", the progress indicator goes back to drawing in blue. However, I should 
not have had to do this, since there were no errors to clear.
This was because we did npt reset the showing error flag when all errors 
removed. Fixed in build &gt;20030808

    <WithStack>If an error occurs in a background thread, the progress indicator is supposed to turn red and flash. 
On the Macintosh, it turns red, then flashes once or twice, but then stops until the mouse is 
moved. Moving the mouse enough to keep the UI live, will cause the indicator to continue to flash.

Are we failing to wake the UI thread after we draw each flash state change? Does this happen for 
free in syncExec, but not in asyncExec? Is it just a Mac bug?
I suspect that this is the Mac that is the issue - the animate job itself does 
not use the UI so it should be be affected by waiting on something to release 
the UI Thread.
The UI may need to be awake in order to make what you are doing become visible. This could be a 
limitation of the Mac only. Adding SN to the CC list to see what he thinks...
This looks like a "wiggly mouse" bug on the Mac.  When there are async's, we 
should never be going to sleep.  It could be that the error that is happening 
in the background thread causes something bad to happen ...?

Please find me.
This functionality has been removed
I know at one point, a similar problem occured for the regular "background activity indicator" icon 
as well. Was that fixed? Was the underlying Mac only problem fixed? It seems like it's a bit early to 
mark this as invalid. Perhaps if there is no more work to be done at the UI level, it could be passed 
to SWT?
No Mac specific work was done for this -- I just removed the code. If there is 
still a problem with the progress indicator then this should be reopened.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When fastviews are open, it is too hard to distinguish them from other views. Particularly if they 
have been resized to align with one of the vertical sashes in the underlying perspective. Given this, 
and the the fact that when you switch away from the perspective and switch back, the fastview is 
not hidden, it is too easy to mistake the fastview for one of the perspective's other views.

We should make fastviews easier to recognize; for example, by drawing them with a distinct 
border, a different background color, and/or some kind of visual indication of the connection 
between the view and the icon in the perspective toolbar.
Another point to consider wrt the new look.
fastviews look different then views in the workbench right now.  For example 
they do not have tabs and they have a different border.</WithStack>

BTW, which 3.0 integration build are you using? Thanks.
M2 .. Thanks
FH tracks GTK version issues.
Is it reproducible ?
Which versions of GTK are you running ?

This error occured when I was using gnome-2.3.5, I am not sure which version of
gtk, that required, but probably different from gnome-2.2.
From the Gnome homepage:
"GNOME 2.3.x is an unstable development series intended for testing and hacking
purposes."
"September 10  2.4.0 FINAL release"

I run on gnome 2.2 every day and I never saw this problem before. I closing this
bug as worksforme. Please, reopen this bug if this problem happen to you on
gnome 2.2.</WithStack>

BTW, which 3.0 integration build are you using? Thanks.
M2 .. Thanks
FH tracks GTK version issues.
Is it reproducible ?
Which versions of GTK are you running ?

This error occured when I was using gnome-2.3.5, I am not sure which version of
gtk, that required, but probably different from gnome-2.2.
From the Gnome homepage:
"GNOME 2.3.x is an unstable development series intended for testing and hacking
purposes."
"September 10  2.4.0 FINAL release"

I run on gnome 2.2 every day and I never saw this problem before. I closing this
bug as worksforme. Please, reopen this bug if this problem happen to you on
gnome 2.2.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>The text editor in Eclipse is pretty limited, e.g. no split screen.

Lots of programmers know and love their Emacs. 

How about a plugin?

Or, if such a plugin exists, perhaps an article on the Eclipse web-site to 
market it?

How long did you wait?  The main thread seems to be happily working (saving
workspace state) without being blocked.  I wonder if it could have been
thrashing due to some bug in progress animation, but it might have actually been
making progress.

The job thread count is high... how long had you been running with that
particular workspace?
I waited for more than 10 minutes. I was using the workspace for about 20
minutes doing
- synchronize
- rebuild all

This used up almost 400MB.

20030813
i see it too - shutting down takes 7-10 minutes and eats my 512 Mb of RAM
(i often lose my patience and kill the process)

I agree it's not a deadlock but most of the time I wait for minutes to get an
OutOfMemoryException.

There was a bug in the UI Animation job (which spins the busy icon in the upper
right), which caused it to reschedule itself in a tight loop during shutdown.
Tod is aware of this bug I'm not sure when a fix will be available.  This is
probably at least part of the problem (I'm not sure if this would have caused
out of memory errors though).

Adam's second stack trace looks like a duplicate of a real deadlock that was in
that integration build: bug 41515.  This one is fixed for this week's build.
I have fixed the animate loop problem in HEAD.
FYI, the past 2 times that I have shut down Eclipse I have had to wait several 
minutes for it to complete. Also, like Adam, it was taking up to 500M of 
memory.

I didn't get a deadlock or OutOfMemory exception though, it just took a long 
time and a lot of memory.

Unfortuanatly I wasn't running with java.exe so I couldn't get a stack trace. 
Have switched to run with a console and will provide more info if/when 
available.
Has anyone seen this with 3.0 M3 or greater?
Closing, I believe this is fixed.  Please reopen if you see this again.</WithStack>

It does not look like a deadlock since the CPU runs at 100%

How long did you wait?  The main thread seems to be happily working (saving
workspace state) without being blocked.  I wonder if it could have been
thrashing due to some bug in progress animation, but it might have actually been
making progress.

The job thread count is high... how long had you been running with that
particular workspace?
I waited for more than 10 minutes. I was using the workspace for about 20
minutes doing
- synchronize
- rebuild all

This used up almost 400MB.

20030813
i see it too - shutting down takes 7-10 minutes and eats my 512 Mb of RAM
(i often lose my patience and kill the process)

I agree it's not a deadlock but most of the time I wait for minutes to get an
OutOfMemoryException.

There was a bug in the UI Animation job (which spins the busy icon in the upper
right), which caused it to reschedule itself in a tight loop during shutdown.
Tod is aware of this bug I'm not sure when a fix will be available.  This is
probably at least part of the problem (I'm not sure if this would have caused
out of memory errors though).

Adam's second stack trace looks like a duplicate of a real deadlock that was in
that integration build: bug 41515.  This one is fixed for this week's build.
I have fixed the animate loop problem in HEAD.
FYI, the past 2 times that I have shut down Eclipse I have had to wait several 
minutes for it to complete. Also, like Adam, it was taking up to 500M of 
memory.

I didn't get a deadlock or OutOfMemory exception though, it just took a long 
time and a lot of memory.

Unfortuanatly I wasn't running with java.exe so I couldn't get a stack trace. 
Have switched to run with a console and will provide more info if/when 
available.
Has anyone seen this with 3.0 M3 or greater?
Closing, I believe this is fixed.  Please reopen if you see this again.</WithOutStack>

Dani - do you know what you were doing when this occured?
No - I found this in .log.

This was due to the subtask having the wrong type (a Job rather than JobInfo) 
for a parent. It was hard to replicate as it doesn't get asked for parents 
that often.

    <WithStack>I normally work with "Link with Editor" switched off.

When editing a long method whose head is out of view, I want to know in which
method I am without leaving the editing position. I'd like to *double*click on
"Link with Editor" in the Java Outline to synchronize it with the current
position (the second click just disables "Link with Editor" again).

This works nicely with the Package Explorer, where a doubleclick on "Link with
Editor" reveals the current file. I think this doubleclick behavior should be
consistently supported by all "Link with Editor" actions.
Created attachment 5682
Proposed patch.
Sorry for the cumbersome problem description above. The PR's summary should read:
"Link with Editor" in Java Outline should link on activation.

The goal is simply to establish the link to the actual edit position already
when the button is checked (and not only when the text cursor moves).
Patch rejected: it would cause an instable Java Outline page (see bug 40074).

    <WithStack>The editor displays a warning when there are multiple catch blocks for the same
try statement. However, this is allowed and often used style.
Of course, the exceptions need to be in the "correct" order such that they can
be caught properly.
Could you please provide a test case that shows this behavior? The "correct"
order should already be checked. It should not complain if the "correct" order
is used.
From mail message:
My example uses an external library: JADE, the API is at
http://jade.cselt.it/doc/api/index.html.

The code is here:
===========================
		 try
		 {
		 		 ...
		 }
		 catch(StaleProxyException spe)
		 {
		 		 spe.printStackTrace();
		 }
		 catch(ControllerException ce)
		 {
		 		 ce.printStackTrace();
		 }
===========================
The second catch is yellow with a warning "Catch block is hidden by another
one in the same try statement"

When I change the order of catches, the second one(StaleProxyException then)
gives an error message "Unreachable catch block".

Please keep the discussion here. It is easier to follow the thread. Thanks.
I download the source and compiled it, but I didn't find this specific error.
Two things to check:
1) Are you sure that the ControllerException is not already handled in the try
block.
Something like:
try {
    ...
    try {
      ....
    } catch(ControllerException  e) {
      ....
    }
    ....
} catch(StaleProxyException e) {
   ....
} catch(ControllerException e) {
    ....
}

2) Try to remove the second catch. The problem could be that this catch block is
never reach because the only exception that could be thrown in the try block is
a StaleProxyException.

Let me know if your code matches one of the cases.
Here is a small test case that might reproduce what you have:

class E1 extends Exception {
	
}

class E2 extends E1 {
}

public class A {

	static void foo() throws E2 {
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			foo();
		} catch(E2 e) {
		} catch(E1 e) {
		}
	}
}

The compiler reports:
Compiled 19 lines in 2500 ms (7.6 lines/s)
3 .class files generated
----------
1. WARNING in D:\temp\A.java (at line 17)

		}
	              ^^^^^^
Catch block is hidden by another one in the same try statement
----------
1 problem (1 warning)

The reason is that the second catch cannot be reached when the first catch is
there. It is not strictly unreachable in the JLS meaning, because a compatible
exception can be thrown inside the try block.
You might try to see if we can improve such a diagnosis, but according to what I
tried, something must be wrong with your try statement.
Besides this warning, I found lot of suspicious warnings compiling the JADE code
using the Eclipse compiler (assignment with no effects, lot of non-static access
and other warnings).
After trying lots of things based on your remarks, the following seems to be 
the cause: I have a comment in my code (/**- ... /**/). When the first part is 
removed the warning disappears! There is no real reason I can think how the two 
things a re connected. Thus, the bug must be somewhere else, such as the 
interpretation of comments in this fashion. Here is the full code of my class. 
If you remove the line with /**- the warning goes away. Reinserting it brings 
the warning back. You will need a class UserAgentGenerator (subclass of 
jade.core.Agent).


package simedia;

import jade.core.Runtime;
import jade.core.Profile;
import jade.core.ProfileImpl;
import jade.wrapper.*;

public class Mediashelf
{
	private MainContainer mc;
	
	public Mediashelf()
	{
		Agent myAgent = null;
		
		try
		{
			// Get a hold on JADE runtime
			Runtime rt = Runtime.instance();
			rt.setCloseVM(true);
			// Launch a complete platform on the 8888 port
			// create a default Profile 
			Profile pMain = new ProfileImpl(null, 8888, null);
			mc = rt.createMainContainer(pMain);
/**-

("rma", "jade.tools.rma.rma", new Object[0]);
			rma.start();
/**/
			// create UserAgentGenerator
			myAgent = (Agent)mc.createNewAgent
("UserAgentGenerator", UserAgentGenerator.class.getName(), new Object[] {  });
			myAgent.start();
		}
		catch(StaleProxyException spe)
		{
			spe.printStackTrace();
		}
		catch(ControllerException ce)
		{
			ce.printStackTrace();
		}
	}

  /**
   * This method starts the Mediashelf
   */
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		new Mediashelf();
	}
}

This is not a bug.
In your code, the first start() invocation (in comment)
// starting the RMA GUI
			AgentController rma = mc.createNewAgent
("rma", "jade.tools.rma.rma", new Object[0]);
			rma.start();

throws a ControllerException whereas the second start() invocation:
 // create UserAgentGenerator
			myAgent = (Agent)mc.createNewAgent
("UserAgentGenerator", UserAgentGenerator.class.getName(), new Object[] {  });
			myAgent.start();
throws only a StaleProxyException. So when the two start() invocations are 
called, the two catch clauses are reachable, but when the first one is 
commented, the second catch clause is hidden by the first catch clause.
Hope this explanation help to understand the code.

    <WithOutStack>The editor displays a warning when there are multiple catch blocks for the same
try statement. However, this is allowed and often used style.
Of course, the exceptions need to be in the "correct" order such that they can
be caught properly.
Could you please provide a test case that shows this behavior? The "correct"
order should already be checked. It should not complain if the "correct" order
is used.
From mail message:
My example uses an external library: JADE, the API is at
http://jade.cselt.it/doc/api/index.html.

The code is here:
===========================
		 try
		 {
		 		 ...
		 }
		 catch(StaleProxyException spe)
		 {
		 		 spe.printStackTrace();
		 }
		 catch(ControllerException ce)
		 {
		 		 ce.printStackTrace();
		 }
===========================
The second catch is yellow with a warning "Catch block is hidden by another
one in the same try statement"

When I change the order of catches, the second one(StaleProxyException then)
gives an error message "Unreachable catch block".

Please keep the discussion here. It is easier to follow the thread. Thanks.
I download the source and compiled it, but I didn't find this specific error.
Two things to check:
1) Are you sure that the ControllerException is not already handled in the try
block.
Something like:
try {
    ...
    try {
      ....
    } catch(ControllerException  e) {
      ....
    }
    ....
} catch(StaleProxyException e) {
   ....
} catch(ControllerException e) {
    ....
}

2) Try to remove the second catch. The problem could be that this catch block is
never reach because the only exception that could be thrown in the try block is
a StaleProxyException.

Let me know if your code matches one of the cases.
Here is a small test case that might reproduce what you have:

class E1 extends Exception {
	
}

class E2 extends E1 {
}

public class A {

	static void foo() throws E2 {
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			foo();
		} catch(E2 e) {
		} catch(E1 e) {
		}
	}
}

The compiler reports:
Compiled 19 lines in 2500 ms (7.6 lines/s)
3 .class files generated
----------
1. WARNING in D:\temp\A.java (at line 17)

    <WithStack>Hi!

Would it not be nice if one could say: "only stop at this breakpoint in 
&lt;some-code-that-is-executed-often&gt; if i have hit the breakpoint at 
&lt;some-other-code&gt; in the same call sequence" ?

The feature should just be like any other conditional breakpoints - just that 
you instead of a coded conditions selects one or more breakpoints that MUST have 
been hit before the conditional breakpoints gets "activated".

This would make my life much easier when debugging code that is very often 
executed, but i only want to see it when this other part of my code has been 
executed.

Hope you like the idea ;)
Yes, I thought this would be nice too. The feature request is currently 
deferred, but it is good to know that somebody else wants this too.

    <WithStack>Hi,

I will explain my proposal using an example:

If I have in my code something like lbView = new javax.swing.JLabel(); I want 
thru a command to transform it in like lbView = new JLabel(); and to 
automatically add import javax.swing.JLabel();

A special attention is needed. An example is java.util.Date and java.sql.Date.

Thanks and best regards,
piri
Hi,

I got no answer yet, is it so stupid?

    <WithStack>The default shortcut keys for "Ctrl+F6" show a small window with the list of 
editor on wich you can navigate by successivel pressing F6 while keeping Ctrl 
pressed.
I would like to have the same behaviour but with "Ctrl+Tab".  So I have 
add "Ctrl+Tab" in the Preferences/workbench/Keys/Window/Next Editor sequence 
keys.
Now, one push of "Ctrl+Tab" works.  But addition pression of Tab while keeping 
Ctrl pressed doesn't work.

dup of bug 6749
Not a duplicate but rather a subset of the things listed in bug 6749.

Could anyone attach some hints of where one would hook a plugin to satisify this
bug?  Just pointing us in the right direction might lead to some contributions
here.  I really want to see auto organizing of imports on save.
Hooking stuff into the save operation affects many areas and introduces several
problems that need to be handled/solved, e.g.:
- correct operation together with team providers
- local file history
- undo/redo history
- the modified code might introduce errors or corrupt the code
- modifying the code might fail (exception)
...

This has meant typing the name followed by a space, and then deleting the space to get the constant

Andre, this doesn't happen under Windows. Can you plase have a look under Mac.

In XML I defined an action with style="toggle" and retarget="true". This results
in a RetargetAction which has NO style bit set (which is OK if we want to allow
to change the shape later) but in RetargetAction.setActionHandler it asks for
its style when retargeting.

I attached a patch where the style retrieved from the concrete handler.

Note: There are other problems when defining a style and retarget="true", e.g.
how would he menu of a retargeted pulldown button be requested.
Created attachment 5690
Patch for RetargetAction
I took a different approach which is to set the style on the RetargetAction.
If the XML says retarget="true" and style="toggle", then it's always a toggle, 
independent of what the handler says.  Also, getting the style from the 
handler would not support style="radio" since this can only be set when first 
creating the action.

Simon, could you please review my changes?  I changed PartEventAction, 
RetargetAction, LabelRetargetAction and WWinPluginAction.

Yes this is even the better approach. Will this also fix the problem with the
style="pulldown": I have also a retargeted pulldown action but there the
retargeted action only gets informed about button being pressed. The drop down
menu is not opened. To get the menu I had to register a delegate in the XML
(class="...") which handles the menu. I think the correct behavior would be to
delegate the opening of the drop down menu to the retargeted action as well.

If it's retargetable, you should not have to specify class=.
I doubt my fix addresses this.

Simon, can you please look at this one?
Since Simon should review the change for this bug I assume it is in tomorrows
I-build, correct? If not, I can change the toggle to a push button for the
I-build since the state of the toggle is incorrect.
Should I file another PR for the pulldown style problem?

The code was released to HEAD, so it will be in the I-build.
I did some testing using the Readme example, but I recommend you testing 
against HEAD too before the I-build.
Nick, I looked at the code and it seems fine.

As for the pulldown attribute, let me know with this fix if you still have the 
same problem. I'm busy with the RCP work right now so it may be post M3 before 
I get a chance to look into this.
I verified this bug using HEAD.
The pulldown style problem is not fixed by this fix. I filed bug 41401 for it so
that this report can be closed.

Ok, closing.</WithStack>

I am suprised that such a serious fault has been open for such a long time. Can I suggest that the severity of this bug is increased to Critical? For users that use CVS Watch/Edit functionality for enforcing informal exclusive locking (as CVS offers no other alternatives) this fault is a major cause of data loss! 
You are free to set the severity if you like. The component committers don't set severity.

As for your other point, there are a couple of reasons why this bug has not been addressed. The main reason is that the solution to the problem is not obvious. The Eclipse CVS client does a bunch of things that the basic command line client does not (e.g. Synchronization, Comparisons). The implementation of these features uses the "cvs update" command on a fake sandbox which seems to fake out the server into thinking that the user is no longer editing the file. Possible solutions could be:

1) Come up with another way to get the advanced funtionality
2) Track the edited files on the server and re-edit them when the edit state is lost
3) Add support to the CVS server for the advanced Eclipse functionality
4) Remove the advanced funtionality from Eclipse

I think that point 2 is impossible and point 3 will never happen. We couldn't do point 4 since the majority of our customers use this funtionality. That leaves point 1 and unfortunately, I don't know how we would accomplish this. That's not to say it's impossible but the solution isn't obvious.
Michael, thanks for the reply - I did attempt to set the severity but BugZilla doesn't appear to allow this on a bug I don't own and didn't raise. Obviously as an end user I was hoping such a severity would translate into an increased priority!

You seem to be saying that the Watch/Edit functionality has never and will never work properly, so I'm suprised it has ever been included in Eclipse. I've never seen any warnings or disclaimers about this functionality?

From your brief description it does sound like the Eclipse CVS client code's design has some fundamental flaws, but surely a work around can be found? For example, whenever it invokes an "update -C" it could then re-invoke the Edit functionality afterwards? Perhaps it isn't that simple, and it would probably have a performance cost, but the client knows which files are being compared? Alternatively I'm sure there are other ways of getting a specific/latest version of a file in CVS other than "update -C" (although I don't pretend to be a CVS expert).


I didn't realize that there were restrictions on who could set the severity. I've set the severity as you requested.

As for the Watch/Edit support, I didn't say it would never work, I said that you can't use Synchronize or Compare if you don't want the edit state lost. You can still use the basic update and commit workflows. As for why Watch/Edit is included, the answer is simple: Eclipse is open source and most of the watch/edit support was contributed by community members. Your point about documenting the shortcomings is well taken. We should add an entry to the readme file.

As for your proposal, I would be happy if someone could tell me a reliable and efficient way to get contents without using update. It would be possible to get synchronizations and comparisons using "cvs diff" but this will only work for some files. If we need to use diff for some files and update for others, there wil be a noticable performance impact.
Thanks for updating the severity - I hope this will to more time being spent looking at it.

I understand your comments about why the Watch/Edit code was originally included, however isolating it as "highly experimental" might have been a good idea at the time. Not being able to take CVS updates in a controlled manner (synchronise) or double check what has been edited before committing a change(compare) are (IMHO) essential uses cases without which we (as a team) would not be able to use CVS.

Restricting compare to text files (supported by cvs diff) sounds a perfectly reasonable solution if it means Watch/Edit will function correctly.
Here is an update to help focus investigation of this issue - on Eclipse 3.1.2 on Windows XP, JDK 1.4.2 and CVS 1.11.18 (on Linux) the "synchronise" functionality itself doesn't cause this fault to be triggered, only the various "compare" options:

- Compare with latest from Head
- Double click on a file in Team Synchronizing Perspective
- Compare with specific revision or version 
There is no plan to address this item.
I'm very disappointed to learn that you have no plans to resolve such a long-standing critical fault in the Eclipse CVS plugin.

This will force my company, and any others that need some sort of locking in CVS, to move away from Eclipse to alternatives such as NetBeans.

That is a shame.
What it really boils down to is priorities. We have limited resources and a lot of work items to be addressed in 3.3. Our main focus is to support the developement of Eclipse.org projects but we do want to support other workflows if the amount of effort is reasonable. My feeling is that addressing this bug would be a considerable amount of work and would require us to drop higher priority items.

Traditionaly, it has been the community that has provided patches for the Watch/Edit support. Are you willing to help out with this in some form? If so, we would be willing to reconsider. Perhaps we would be able to come up with a reasonable solution that is not a major rework of how comparisons are done.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

The Eclipse CVS client does a bunch of things that the basic command line client does not (e.g. Synchronization, Comparisons). The implementation of these features uses the "cvs update" command on a fake sandbox which seems to fake out the server into thinking that the user is no longer editing the file. Possible solutions could be:

1) Come up with another way to get the advanced funtionality
2) Track the edited files on the server and re-edit them when the edit state is lost
3) Add support to the CVS server for the advanced Eclipse functionality
4) Remove the advanced funtionality from Eclipse

I think that point 2 is impossible and point 3 will never happen. We couldn't do point 4 since the majority of our customers use this funtionality. That leaves point 1 and unfortunately, I don't know how we would accomplish this. That's not to say it's impossible but the solution isn't obvious.
Michael, thanks for the reply - I did attempt to set the severity but BugZilla doesn't appear to allow this on a bug I don't own and didn't raise. Obviously as an end user I was hoping such a severity would translate into an increased priority!

You seem to be saying that the Watch/Edit functionality has never and will never work properly, so I'm suprised it has ever been included in Eclipse. I've never seen any warnings or disclaimers about this functionality?

From your brief description it does sound like the Eclipse CVS client code's design has some fundamental flaws, but surely a work around can be found? For example, whenever it invokes an "update -C" it could then re-invoke the Edit functionality afterwards? Perhaps it isn't that simple, and it would probably have a performance cost, but the client knows which files are being compared? Alternatively I'm sure there are other ways of getting a specific/latest version of a file in CVS other than "update -C" (although I don't pretend to be a CVS expert).


I didn't realize that there were restrictions on who could set the severity. I've set the severity as you requested.

As for the Watch/Edit support, I didn't say it would never work, I said that you can't use Synchronize or Compare if you don't want the edit state lost. You can still use the basic update and commit workflows. As for why Watch/Edit is included, the answer is simple: Eclipse is open source and most of the watch/edit support was contributed by community members. Your point about documenting the shortcomings is well taken. We should add an entry to the readme file.

As for your proposal, I would be happy if someone could tell me a reliable and efficient way to get contents without using update. It would be possible to get synchronizations and comparisons using "cvs diff" but this will only work for some files. If we need to use diff for some files and update for others, there wil be a noticable performance impact.
Thanks for updating the severity - I hope this will to more time being spent looking at it.

I understand your comments about why the Watch/Edit code was originally included, however isolating it as "highly experimental" might have been a good idea at the time. Not being able to take CVS updates in a controlled manner (synchronise) or double check what has been edited before committing a change(compare) are (IMHO) essential uses cases without which we (as a team) would not be able to use CVS.

Restricting compare to text files (supported by cvs diff) sounds a perfectly reasonable solution if it means Watch/Edit will function correctly.
Here is an update to help focus investigation of this issue - on Eclipse 3.1.2 on Windows XP, JDK 1.4.2 and CVS 1.11.18 (on Linux) the "synchronise" functionality itself doesn't cause this fault to be triggered, only the various "compare" options:

- Compare with latest from Head
- Double click on a file in Team Synchronizing Perspective
- Compare with specific revision or version 
There is no plan to address this item.
I'm very disappointed to learn that you have no plans to resolve such a long-standing critical fault in the Eclipse CVS plugin.

This will force my company, and any others that need some sort of locking in CVS, to move away from Eclipse to alternatives such as NetBeans.

That is a shame.
What it really boils down to is priorities. We have limited resources and a lot of work items to be addressed in 3.3. Our main focus is to support the developement of Eclipse.org projects but we do want to support other workflows if the amount of effort is reasonable. My feeling is that addressing this bug would be a considerable amount of work and would require us to drop higher priority items.

Traditionaly, it has been the community that has provided patches for the Watch/Edit support. Are you willing to help out with this in some form? If so, we would be willing to reconsider. Perhaps we would be able to come up with a reasonable solution that is not a major rework of how comparisons are done.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithOutStack>

When I do a compare with an out of synch file I get two exceptions (I think 
the are in this order). I have added Mike to the list as I think this might 
have something to do with the problems he saw earlier in the week.

STEPS
1) Open Live Synch View
2) Edit a file under CVS control externally (I did this with our buildnotes)
3) Save it
4) Go to the synch view and refresh (I think this is where the CVS Exception 
came from)
5) The file will show up as a conflict. Double click on it
6) Internal error is shown (the NPE below)

I wasn't able to get the NPE but I did notice a couple of other strangeness with
resources that are out-of-sync (OOS) with the file system.

1. opening the compare editor with an OOS resource shows the local as empty.
This is because the ResourceNode eats the CoreException and return null.

2. the background sync chokes on OOS resources because the CVS plugin doesn't
handle them well. We should investigate how to refresh files in these cases and
ensuring that the CVS meta files are also loaded. The problem is that a refresh
will cause a delta and builds...
Can we *please* just build in "auto-sync with the filesystem"? The old behavior was never what 
people wanted anyway.

If the auot-refresh plugin was available, would there still exist cases where 
a file is out-of-sync? I assume that on Linux this would be true because the 
verification algorithm is a simple poll.
Well, yes... But clearly at any point where we currently detect the case and put up a dialog, we 
could just detect the case and do the refresh. This plus the background (polled) update would 
likely work well enough for all situations.

The NPE is fixed but the refresh problem is still valid. Marking as dupe of our
refresh with file system bug.

When I do a compare with an out of synch file I get two exceptions (I think 
the are in this order). I have added Mike to the list as I think this might 
have something to do with the problems he saw earlier in the week.

STEPS
1) Open Live Synch View
2) Edit a file under CVS control externally (I did this with our buildnotes)
3) Save it
4) Go to the synch view and refresh (I think this is where the CVS Exception 
came from)
5) The file will show up as a conflict. Double click on it
6) Internal error is shown (the NPE below)

    <WithStack>Currently if you want to use the help for some plug-in you have to have that 
plug-in installed in your Eclipse IDE. Since our current development setup is 
different from the one of an Eclipse developer that is not always the best 
option.

In our current setup we have plain Eclipse as our development IDE. In the 
product we are developing one of the pre-requisites is GEF. If I want to see 
GEF docs and help I have to install those plug-ins in my IDE even though I do 
not use GEF in my IDE. It is only used in the product we're developing.

There should be a better way to include help/docs without having to install 
the given plug-ins in your IDE. There could be an option to point to help 
files or plug-ins while running Eclipse and dinamically populate the help 
system.
To view help of a plug-in that is in your workspace you do not have to install 
this plug-in in your IDE, you can launch it using PDE.

I do not believe that help system contained in Eclipse Platform should be able 
to launch help for code in the workspace, whether it is packaged as Eclipse 
help or other help.

I think there should be a way to view help in Eclipse format for a plug-in in 
the workspace only if PDE has been installed.  And currently it is already 
possible.  You can use PDE to launch runtime workbench using most plug-ins 
from development workbench plus the plug-in from workspace that contains help 
for component you are using.  This lets you view help for a component without 
destabilizing your IDE configuration.

I agree that there an easier way not involving more than couple of mouse 
clicks, would be helpful, but doubt that it should be made part of Eclipse 
Platform or Rich Client Platform (in 3.0).  It is definitely an IDE task.

Another way for an easier access to GEF documentation is to have the 
documentation installed on an infocenter, and be accessible using a browser.  
Eclipse help system supports this scenario, but some effort and resources to 
set up an infocenter is required on part of library provider.
Marking as P4 - unlikely to be looked at for 3.1.
Having remote help where you can browse help installed on a remote infocenter would allow you to browse help for plugins not installed as part of the base workbench. Marking as duplicate.

    <WithStack>In org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog, the private createCancelButton()

Question - why do you want to change the label? Cancel is a pretty universal 
concept and this string is externalized.
We're designing a type of Web Services Browser around the wizard framework and 
would like to change the "Cancel" label to "Close". Eclipse documents that we 
should be able to get at this Button using getCancelButton() (which has been 
deprecated) or getButton(IDialogConstants.CANCEL_ID) so it should work, 
shouldn't it?
The method createButtonsForButtonBar() was already provided so that the button

    <WithStack>We current develop our product using .link files and the "Target Platform" 
preference. In our case that makes life easier but it could be more flexible.

In our scenario we base our product in 2 other products (P1 and P2). P1 
contains the base Eclipse and is the one we define in "Target Platform". Under 
P1 we have a link file pointing to P2. That gives us the flexibility of 
easially moving between P2 versions (both up and down) as necessary.

Sometimes we need to have 2 workspaces when working on different problems. In 
those cases it might happen that each workspace requires a different version 
of P2. That is where we do not have enough flexibility. Since the version of 
P2 is defined by the link file under P1 we have to have 2 copies of P1 in 
order to work with 2 versions of P2 (on different workspaces).

So, my feature request is as follows: eliminate the need of having a link file 
under the "Target Platform" and replace that (of course, only in development 
time) with:

1) Still be able to define the Target Platform (an Eclipse compatible 
application)
2) Be able to define the "link files" in the same preference page. That 
preference would be stored per workspace eliminating the need of various 
copies of the Target Platform application (which can be huge).

well, in 3.0M6, OSGi came and the rest is history :-)

Wassim, isn't this pretty much taken care of with target definitions (you know, those things people never use).
yes, this one is covered by a "Target Definition" where you can specify multiple locations.

    <WithStack>The repository view if you have clicked on a folder say org.junit folder in the 
eclipse CVS repository, and then you scroll up to say org.apache.ant and click 
on the + to expand that node the scroll view will jump all the way down to 
org.junit when the expansion is complete. It is very annoying and can be 
difficult for a user to understand why it is happening!
Tod, this is the auto-scroll behaviour we have talked about before. When the 
repo view fetches the children in the background once the cihldren are added 
to the tree they get auto-scrolled. This is confusing because the user could 
have scrolled, expanded somewhere else.

I remember you mentioned some solution for this, but I forget the details.

    <WithStack>org.eclipse.swt.layout.FormData should have a meaningful toString() method for 
debugging purposes (FormAttachment does, so it would be logical to have one for 
FormData as well).
What would you like it to print?  No other layout data object has a toString
().  So I'm tempted not to do anything.  Got a good case ...?
Well for starters it seems logical to print out all of the top/bottom, 
left/right attachments for FormData.  Since FormData only contains 6 publically 
accessible fields it is probably worthwhile to just print all of them.

It would also be helpful to add similar methods to the other LayoutData classes 
as well, although I haven't had a need because we mainly use FormLayouts.
Vikki, didn't you just fix this?
In 3.1, toString added for all SWT layouts and their layout data.</WithStack>

Thanks for the patch. But this only solves part of the problem since currently
apply patch doesn't allow multi-select. We won't be able to fix this for 3.0.

Would Bug 103871 work as a solution to this problem?
It would - the only case where it would fail would be to in creating a patch that spans projects.  But I 
guess in that case, one could always run "Create Patch" foir each project.

See my comments in bub 103871 comment 3. I think the multi-selection can be used
to prepopulate the wizard page that is requested there.

Here's a patch for the workspace patcher. Main changes made to the current
patching mechanism are as follows:

Create Patch
- Allows multiple selections of elements
- Preview page for changes contained in patch (also allows for selection of
patch contents)
- Patches can now be rooted at the workspace level, the project level or the
selection level

Apply Patch
- Wizard guides users to appropriate pages based on patch type
- Allows users to retarget workspace patches for projects that don't exist in
current workspace

To activate workspace patch, you have to pass in the following VM arg on startup:

-DworkspacePatch=true

How difficult would it be for us to back-port this to 3.1.x?  I ask because we were looking into doing just this today but it would be great if we could take this work that's been done and include it in our packages for Fedora :)

What needs to be changed other than org.eclipse.compare?

Thanks,

There were quite a few changes in CVS since we also added the ability to perform the create patch in the background. I think they are localized to a few classes but, unfortunately, my development workstation just died so I can't give you the exact class names. You shoudl be able to see what changed by trying to port the 'Create Patch' wizard and then see what additional classes are referenced.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Please disable QuickDiff by default. It's a neat feature, but I don't think 
enough people use it (because I haven't heard many people request it) to warrant 
turning it on by default.
How would you get to know it and try it if you never see it? What bothers you
with the feature i.e. why do you want to have it disabled? Under windows it is
almost not visible unless you hover over a change.
I am also bothered by the QuickDiff feature because as of 3.0M6 there seems
to be no way to disable it permanently. I disabled "Always show QuickDiff
coloring" in "Work in progress" preferences, and nevertheless the extra
margin and the ugly grey line on the left-hand side are present (I am talking
about Linux/GTK here; I haven't checked it out under Windows). Hitting
CTRL-SHIFT-Q makes them disappear, but when I reopen a file in the editor,
they are back there!

QuickDiff might be a useful feature, but it should be available per user's
request. Having switched from 2.1 to 3.0, the first thing I noticed is that
the editor GUI got "somehow" uglier - and it took me some observation (plus
some reading) to figure out the cause.
Note that there are two settings, for the text editor and java editor, where you
can turn on / off the quick diff setting.
I back out from my previous comment - QuickDiff *can* be disabled as
Workbench/Editors/Text Editor/QuickDiff/Always show QuickDiff coloring.
The quick diff feature is not memory friendly when it comes to large documents 
because it creates multiple instances of the same string (string representation 
of the document). Check out the implementation of 
org.eclipse.jface.text.GapTextStore. These strings could be very large in size, 
so you can easlier run out of memory.

An alternate solution to disable it by default is to ask the user the first 
time an Eclipse editor comes up. The prompt would have a "remember this 
decision" checkbox that would update the preference if checked. This way, the 
user can decide whether to enable this or not. Cause it's not obvious to the 
user what "quick diff" does and where to disable/enable it.
There are no plans to change this.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The javadoc for List's getSelectedIndices() doesn't say anything about the 
ordering of the array returned. Could you add a note saying either it's sorted 
in (for example) ascending order, or in no particular order?
Selection order, not just indices, is undefined in every widget in SWT due to 
the platform.  Not sure where to document this.

Any ideas Vikki or do we just change the JavaDoc for every getSelection* that 
returns an array?
I would change the javadoc for every selection that returns an array.  If you 
update the javadoc for Windows, we can bash the comments for the other 
platforms.

    <WithStack>If you drop down the combo list using the mouse and then select an entry using
the mouse, the CCombo fires a defaultSelection. It shouldn't do this. It should
fire a selection instead.

Default selection means something was selected and you should go and do
something. The typical reaction is to process the selection and dismiss the dialog.

A combo shouldn't fire default selection from just selecting an entry in the
dropdown. A typical user of a combobox would be vert surprised to have the
dialog be dismissed just because the entry was selected. Standard Combos won't
do this.

Because of this you can't tell the difference between just selecting an entry
using the mouse and hitting enter from the text field of the CCombo. Hitting
enter from the text field should be treated as default selection.
Vikki, if this is true, please fix, pronto.  Thanks.
Fixed for I20030812
Pressing the ENTER key is still inconsistent with Combo. Combo will always 
allow the Shell's default button to receive the ENTER key. CCombo will never 
allow this to happen. This is true whether the drop-down list is being 
displayed or not, and for both readonly and editable widgets.</WithStack>

JRE Installation issue.
Move to JDT/Debug.
To clarify the problem, could please provide steps to reproduce the problem.
Steps to reproduce Problem:

1) Install Java3D (java3d-1_3_1-windows-i586-directx-sdk.exe if using Windows)
or equivalent from http://java.sun.com. Use the Version that installs as JRE
Extension library. Also do download the Java3D API documentation and put it

3)choose installed JRE (I use jdk1.4.2). You should see three additional
libraries in the list of System libraries ({JRE|JDK}_HOME/lib/ext/j3daudio.jar,
{JRE|JDK}_HOME/lib/ext/j3dcore.jar, {JRE|JDK}_HOME/lib/ext/j3dutils.jar).

3) Set a Javadoc URL (e.g. "file:/C:/j2sdk1.4.2/docs/api/") in the edit JRE
Window and close it by pressing OK

4)Choose any open Project and unfold "JRE System libraries" until the three
added libraries become visible. Choose any of the three and open the library's
properties using the context menu.

5) Enter path to the Java3D API documentation which is downloadable (separately
form the Java 3D installation archive) from java.sun.com in the field javadoc
location and confirm setting by closing window with OK.

6) The API documentation for the Java3D classes is now accessible by pressing F1
in the Java editor.

7) Close Eclipse and start it again.

8) The Javadoc location entered in step 5 has been replaced by the javadoc
location configured in step 3 - the Java3D API documentation is no longer

Martin, where is the library-specific javadoc location stored? The JRE only has 
one setting (i.e. for the JRE, not per library). It looks like we re-set this 
on startup when restoring the saved JRE settings. This fires a property change 
event on the JRE which you must be listening to, which in turn re-sets the 
javadoc location for all the libraries.
Yes, that's correct, it's the JavaDocVMInstallListener which gets this single
location and sets it to all library locations.

The store that keeps the javadoc location paths is in jdt.ui and  the API to
access it is JavaUI.set/getLibraryJavadocLocation.

You could extend the JRE LibrrayLocation to include a Javadoc location as well,
so we could have it on a per JAR basis.

The reason for this complicated listener setup was that the java.launching
plugin does not know of jdt.ui.

A point of concern.

You have marked an earlier bug, 35336, as a duplicate of this bug.  My concern
is that this bug appears to be concerned with functioinality which doesn't
presently exist but perhaps should.  The original bug was concerned with the
mechanism used to implements existing functionality from a specified part of the
user interface.  i.e. the facility to do what is required already exists an can
be proved to function properly if accessed from a different part of the user
interface.

I make no claim to know if the internal workings of eclipse but would merely ask
that you take care to ensure you're not about to loose a bug by hiding it behind
a different, if closely related, one.

My understanding of the problem is that a user can assign a javadoc location to 
each jar in a JRE via the "build path" pages. However, an "installed JRE" only 
allows for one javadoc location (via the edit/add dialog for a JRE). Re-opening 
the "installed JRE" edit dialog will overwrite any individual jars that have 
been set by the user.
About #35336:

It's not possible to set the javadoc location for a path that starts with a classpath variable. For 
instance &lt;classpathentry kind="var" path="NEXT_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Frameworks/
JavaWebObjects.framework/Resources/Java/javawebobjects.jar"/&gt;. NEXT_SYSTEM_ROOT is a valid 
classpath variable. 

To make it a little bit clearer. It's possible to set the Javadoc location trough the UI interface. 
Anyway the info is not stored persistent. 
The information *is* persisted - it's just not persisted in the .project file. 
The information is persisted as a user setting, rather than a project setting.
No it's not persistent. It's possible to set the javadoc location. After reopening the properites page 
the javadoc location is NONE.
Yes - that's the bug. The info is persisted, but we incorrectly overwrite it.
Nothing planned on debug side for 3.0. Moving to JUI for consideration (if JUI 
can selectively listen to VM changes/updates).
I can reproduce the behavior of comment 0 in 3.0 RC1,
with a pure SDK and a docs zip:

- expand the JRE System Library in the Package Explorer and select rt.jar,
    core.jar, or whatever the main jar in your installation is
- context menu &gt; Properties
- set the Javadoc Location to "Javadoc in archive" and enter pathes for doc zip
- click OK, open type Vector and press Shift+F2
=&gt; the javadoc is (correctly) taken from the jar for this session

- shut down eclipse, restart
=&gt; the "Javadoc in archive" setting has been forgotten; all jars take the JRE's
javadoc URL

Problem description:
The Javadoc locations are managed by jdt.ui. jdt.launching also keeps a javadoc
location per vm install; jdt.launching does not know jdt.ui: jdt.ui therefore
listens for vm changes and updates its locations whenever a location in a vm
install changed.

jdt.launching can be loaded before jdt.ui and jdt.ui delays the loading of the
javadoc locations to the first accessed of it. That means on initialization,
the location store must assume that it might have missed some vm install
changes since the last save.

The old code used to completly refresh all locations on initialize with the
most actual vm install javadoc locations.
Doing that it made unnecessary updates and always overwrote user changes.

The fix for 3.0.x is to always remember the last known vm install settings. On
initalization, the remembered vm install settings are compared with the actual
ones and only the locations for changed vm installs are updated.

The real fix will be to move the javadoc locations to jdt.core so jdt.launching
can set them itself.

    <WithStack>I defined a new plugin project 'pluginA' and on the 'Plug-in Project Name' 
wizard page, I specified a path of F:\eclipsedev\plugins for the project 
contents.  The wizard automatically created a directory 
F:\eclipsedev\plugins\pluginA and its contents.

When I attempted to define a second plugin project, 'pluginB', I specified the 
same path on the 'Plug-in Project Name' wizard page: F:\eclipsedev\plugins.  
However, the wizard did not allow this, and displayed the message:

  "F:/eclipsedev/plugins and F:/eclipsedev/plugins/pluginA overlap"

However, had the wizard allowed me to continue, pluginB would have been created 
in its own, distinct directory.

This behavior is a regression from version 2.1.0, build 200303272130.

I'm currently using version 3.0, build 200307181617.
What type of project are you trying to create? I cannot reproduce this 
problem. Do you have any more steps that I can follow to make it happen? This 
is what I am doing...what am I doing wrong?

In the New Project Wizard, I changed the name of the project to be PluginA and 
I un-checked the "use default" check box and entered \eclipsedev\plugins in 
the text field. After pressing Finish the .project file for the PluginA 
project was created (in \eclipsedev\plugins\.project) and an extra directory 
PluginA was NOT created. (this is expected behaviour)
Comments from originator:
------------------------

After receiving your response, I stepped through the process again, and I
still see the problem.  I'm using Eclipse 3.0, build 200307181617; maybe
you're using a newer development build?  Here are the exact steps --- in my
original post, I had changed the directory/plugin names from what I was
really using, but here I'll provide the exact names, in case that makes a
difference:

      1) In the directory F:\Eclipse3, I run 'jar xvf
            eclipse-SDL-3.0M2-win32.zip'.
      2) Double-click desktop icon (created earlier) which has target:

            F:\Eclipse3\eclipse\eclipse.exe -data F:\Eclipse3\eclipsedata

      3) Start the 'New Project' wizard by right-clicking in the Resource
            Navigator view, and select 'Plug-in Development'/'Plug-in
Project'.
      4) In the 'Plug-in Project Name' WizardPage, enter the project name
            'com.lawson.lef'.
      5) Uncheck the 'Use default' checkbox.
      6) Browse to the folder 'F:\Eclipse3\skade\plugins', creating new
            folders as necessary, to populate the 'Directory' field.
      7) Click 'Next'.
      8) On the 'Plug-in Project Structure' page, accept the defaults and
            click 'Next'.
      9) On the 'Plug-in Code Generators' page, choose 'Create a Blnk
            Plug-in Project' and click 'Finish'.
      10) Navigate to F:\Eclipse3\skade\plugins in Windows Explorer, see
            that the directory
            F:\Eclipse3\skade\plugins\com.lawson.lef
            has been created, containing subfolders 'src' and 'bin' and the
            project metadata files.
      11) Repeat Step (3).
      12) Repeat Step (4), only this time enter the project name
            'com.lawson.lef.navigator'.
      13) Repeat Steps (5) and (6).
      14) The error message 'F:/Eclipse3/skade/plugins and
            F:/Eclipse3/skade/plugins/com.lawson.lef
            overlap.' appears, and I can't continue in the 'New Project'
wizard.

200303272130 installed on the same box, with identically named projects
(I'm trying to start the porting process, you see).  Obviously, the two
Eclipse installations are in separate folders with separate .metadata
folders.  It has always been my impression that Eclipse ignores the Windows
registry, but if that's wrong, perhaps Eclipse3 is picking up some of my
existing Eclipse 2.1 configuration data.

P.P.S. For the hell of it, I also tried defining a project named
'projectA', and in that case too, a 'projectA' folder was created.
We have been unable to reproduce this problem because the Plugin Project wizard
acts different from the Java and Simple project wizards. The plugin project
wizard is appending the name of the project to the location provided in the
wizard page. (org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.CoreUtility.createProject). Thus, if
you create a project called "A" with  a location of "c:\temp\skade\plugins":

For a Simple or Java project, you get a project like this:

c:\temp\skade\plugins
c:\temp\skade\plugins\.project
c:\temp\skade\plugins\.classpath
c:\temp\skade\plugins\src
  ... etc...

For a Plugin Project, with the exact same path provided on the wizard page, you
get the following:

c:\temp\skade\plugins\A
c:\temp\skade\plugins\A\.project
c:\temp\skade\plugins\A\.classpath
c:\temp\skade\plugins\A\src
  ... etc...

The Plugin wizard should not be appending the name to the project location

DJ, +1 for RC3?

The fix for this one is trivial.

The problem is back on 3.0.2 release.
Somebody reverted the solution?</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I defined a new plugin project 'pluginA' and on the 'Plug-in Project Name' 
wizard page, I specified a path of F:\eclipsedev\plugins for the project 
contents.  The wizard automatically created a directory 
F:\eclipsedev\plugins\pluginA and its contents.

When I attempted to define a second plugin project, 'pluginB', I specified the 
same path on the 'Plug-in Project Name' wizard page: F:\eclipsedev\plugins.  
However, the wizard did not allow this, and displayed the message:

  "F:/eclipsedev/plugins and F:/eclipsedev/plugins/pluginA overlap"

However, had the wizard allowed me to continue, pluginB would have been created 
in its own, distinct directory.

This behavior is a regression from version 2.1.0, build 200303272130.

I'm currently using version 3.0, build 200307181617.
What type of project are you trying to create? I cannot reproduce this 
problem. Do you have any more steps that I can follow to make it happen? This 
is what I am doing...what am I doing wrong?

In the New Project Wizard, I changed the name of the project to be PluginA and 
I un-checked the "use default" check box and entered \eclipsedev\plugins in 
the text field. After pressing Finish the .project file for the PluginA 
project was created (in \eclipsedev\plugins\.project) and an extra directory 
PluginA was NOT created. (this is expected behaviour)
Comments from originator:
------------------------

After receiving your response, I stepped through the process again, and I
still see the problem.  I'm using Eclipse 3.0, build 200307181617; maybe
you're using a newer development build?  Here are the exact steps --- in my
original post, I had changed the directory/plugin names from what I was
really using, but here I'll provide the exact names, in case that makes a
difference:

      1) In the directory F:\Eclipse3, I run 'jar xvf
            eclipse-SDL-3.0M2-win32.zip'.
      2) Double-click desktop icon (created earlier) which has target:

            F:\Eclipse3\eclipse\eclipse.exe -data F:\Eclipse3\eclipsedata

      3) Start the 'New Project' wizard by right-clicking in the Resource
            Navigator view, and select 'Plug-in Development'/'Plug-in
Project'.
      4) In the 'Plug-in Project Name' WizardPage, enter the project name
            'com.lawson.lef'.
      5) Uncheck the 'Use default' checkbox.
      6) Browse to the folder 'F:\Eclipse3\skade\plugins', creating new
            folders as necessary, to populate the 'Directory' field.
      7) Click 'Next'.
      8) On the 'Plug-in Project Structure' page, accept the defaults and
            click 'Next'.
      9) On the 'Plug-in Code Generators' page, choose 'Create a Blnk
            Plug-in Project' and click 'Finish'.
      10) Navigate to F:\Eclipse3\skade\plugins in Windows Explorer, see
            that the directory
            F:\Eclipse3\skade\plugins\com.lawson.lef
            has been created, containing subfolders 'src' and 'bin' and the
            project metadata files.
      11) Repeat Step (3).
      12) Repeat Step (4), only this time enter the project name
            'com.lawson.lef.navigator'.
      13) Repeat Steps (5) and (6).
      14) The error message 'F:/Eclipse3/skade/plugins and
            F:/Eclipse3/skade/plugins/com.lawson.lef
            overlap.' appears, and I can't continue in the 'New Project'
wizard.

    <WithStack>The ConsoleLineNotifier will incorrectly notify that a line has been appended 
when the line is incomplete yet the process has terminated.

Test case can be an external Ant build from bug 41156.

If a line does not yet have a demiliter BUT the console process has 
terminated, the notifier still processes that line.  This seems incorrect in 
general.

We notify the line trackers of the incomplete line region. Then consoleChange 
notification arrives for the further changes to the console document including 
the rest of the line that was just incorrectly processed.
I need to look closer - but I recall this was to notify of the last line in the 
console (in case of no line terminator).
Yes this is what I remember that code for as well.
Fixed. Removed fix for bug 31734.

    <WithStack>Currently it is possible to pass arguments to the JVM that Eclipse runs in with
the -vmargs option on the command line.  The options given, however, aren't used
when running a unit test or application; these start in their own JVM.  The
JVM's arguments can be set from the "Run..." option.

It would be nice to have a way to configure a default set of arguments to the VM
so that they don't have to be configured for every Run configuration
individually.  For example, it might be really nice to be able to pass something
like this to every Run instance by default:

  -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=foobar -DproxyPort=1080

(rather than having to set those up individually for every Junit class, etc)

Note that you can workaround this by adding your specific VM arguments in the eclipse.ini file (as it is done for -Xmx and Xms) and append these VM arguments in your launch config while creating it (set the check-box "Append the VM arguments specified in the target's launcher INI file" in the "Launching Arguments" tab of the Plug-in Development -&gt; Target Platform preference page).

This bug should really have a higher priority. Please consider for 3.5.

My bug 89670 got marked as a dupe, but I'm not sure that this entirely captures my enhancement request.

I was asking that we break apart the options that:
- Describe the application to be launched
- Describe the input to that application
- Describe the environment in which it is to be launched

...in which case the launch configuration itself would simplified to a choice of application, environment, and input. I'm not sure that providing a default set of VM arguments would entirely provide the functionality I'm looking for.

*** Bug 256005 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Please consider this for 3.5.
Sorry, this is not on the 3.5 plan and it is too late for 3.5. Resources were never allocated to do the work. I believe this is a big enough work item/feature that it would have needed to be in the M5 "big" feature freeze.
Another possible requirement is to be able to create templates at different scopes - similar to preferences. For example, at user, project, and enterprise levels.

Core infrastructure

First implementation of headless infrastructure to support launch configuration templates, with tests. The wiki has been updated with a design doc/use cases:

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/Plan/3.6/Launch_Templates
Any chance we could see and review a quick outside-in description of the UI before this is implemented?

I'm still not sure this will address my use-cases for bug 89670, which asks that I be able to separate the settings that describe the program being launched, its environment, and its input... and then be allowed to mix-and-match programs, configurations, and environments.

It's good to see some momentum here, but I assume that by the time this is fully coded, it will be to late to comment on the workflows.
My appologies. I see you referenced a wiki page that I somehow missed. Please disregard my request for more details.

patch.

Work in progress. Hoewver, we've hit a snag as documented in the WIKI and on the mailing list. Since configurations can use the absence of an attribute to indicate data/trigger behavior, using a simple approach of copying attrbites from the template to the configuration does not work as expected.
Work on templates has been deferred. To properly implement/integrate this feature requires more UI work than originally understood. The stumbling block centers around the fact that the UI needs to be able to distinguish which launch attributes are included in the template and which are not (as well as being able to validate templates properly). Just leaving attributes blank is not sufficient to denote that an attribute is excluded, as empty attributes can actually be relevant in templates (to indicate default settings such as using a project default JRE). Thus, integrating this feature would require all launch tab contributors to contribute new UI for templates - our hope was to be able to re-use existing implementations with no/minimal changes from exiting implementations.

As well, being able to integrate templates with launch shortcuts/configuration creation (for example, default template for project), requires changes in existing implementations.

We simply don't have the resources available to implement this feature.
I understand that a complete solution is expensive, but would a partial implementation be possible? By the sounds of the comments, what people need is the ability to provide global JVM args. In my case I want to be able to say that all Java processes should start up with -Xmx1024m. Could a field be made available on a project where I could specify that? It's not a complete solution, but might cover a large portion of the requests.

There would be the question of what to do if one of the JVM args is 'overridden' in a run target. I don't know how the JVM would respond to arguments like this: "-Xmx1024m -Xmx512m". I'd hope that it takes the last argument, but I haven't checked.

Note that JREs already support VM arguments that get applied to all launches. You can add VM args to the JRE's "Default VM Arguments" text box available via: Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Installed JREs &gt; Edit...
We are having the same need for templates but for the list of active plug-ins rather than just VM arguments (which can be taken care of by modifying the "Target Platform" in the PDE Preferences).
For development we have some plug-ins installed (e.g. subversion) which definitely we don't want active when running the unit tests, and automatically created run/debug configurations for junit or SWTBot include "all workspace and enabled target plugins" so we need to manually edit the configuration every time.
&gt;include "all workspace and
&gt;enabled target plugins" so we need to manually edit the configuration every
&gt;time.
Why? Can't you simply disable the bundles in your Target Platform?

Sorry, this is not on the 3.5 plan and it is too late for 3.5. Resources were never allocated to do the work. I believe this is a big enough work item/feature that it would have needed to be in the M5 "big" feature freeze.
Another possible requirement is to be able to create templates at different scopes - similar to preferences. For example, at user, project, and enterprise levels.

Core infrastructure

First implementation of headless infrastructure to support launch configuration templates, with tests. The wiki has been updated with a design doc/use cases:

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/Plan/3.6/Launch_Templates
Any chance we could see and review a quick outside-in description of the UI before this is implemented?

I'm still not sure this will address my use-cases for bug 89670, which asks that I be able to separate the settings that describe the program being launched, its environment, and its input... and then be allowed to mix-and-match programs, configurations, and environments.

It's good to see some momentum here, but I assume that by the time this is fully coded, it will be to late to comment on the workflows.
My appologies. I see you referenced a wiki page that I somehow missed. Please disregard my request for more details.

patch.

Work in progress. Hoewver, we've hit a snag as documented in the WIKI and on the mailing list. Since configurations can use the absence of an attribute to indicate data/trigger behavior, using a simple approach of copying attrbites from the template to the configuration does not work as expected.
Work on templates has been deferred. To properly implement/integrate this feature requires more UI work than originally understood. The stumbling block centers around the fact that the UI needs to be able to distinguish which launch attributes are included in the template and which are not (as well as being able to validate templates properly). Just leaving attributes blank is not sufficient to denote that an attribute is excluded, as empty attributes can actually be relevant in templates (to indicate default settings such as using a project default JRE). Thus, integrating this feature would require all launch tab contributors to contribute new UI for templates - our hope was to be able to re-use existing implementations with no/minimal changes from exiting implementations.

As well, being able to integrate templates with launch shortcuts/configuration creation (for example, default template for project), requires changes in existing implementations.

We simply don't have the resources available to implement this feature.
I understand that a complete solution is expensive, but would a partial implementation be possible? By the sounds of the comments, what people need is the ability to provide global JVM args. In my case I want to be able to say that all Java processes should start up with -Xmx1024m. Could a field be made available on a project where I could specify that? It's not a complete solution, but might cover a large portion of the requests.

There would be the question of what to do if one of the JVM args is 'overridden' in a run target. I don't know how the JVM would respond to arguments like this: "-Xmx1024m -Xmx512m". I'd hope that it takes the last argument, but I haven't checked.

Note that JREs already support VM arguments that get applied to all launches. You can add VM args to the JRE's "Default VM Arguments" text box available via: Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Installed JREs &gt; Edit...
We are having the same need for templates but for the list of active plug-ins rather than just VM arguments (which can be taken care of by modifying the "Target Platform" in the PDE Preferences).
For development we have some plug-ins installed (e.g. subversion) which definitely we don't want active when running the unit tests, and automatically created run/debug configurations for junit or SWTBot include "all workspace and enabled target plugins" so we need to manually edit the configuration every time.
&gt;include "all workspace and
&gt;enabled target plugins" so we need to manually edit the configuration every
&gt;time.
Why? Can't you simply disable the bundles in your Target Platform?

Are there any plans to include this feature in one of the next eclipse releases?

Because there is no possibility to change the working directory of new launch configurations automatically. I need this because I want to separate the launch folder from my workspace when I launch a Java application.

    <WithStack>Eclipse 3.0 is planning to support non-Java partitions in the Java editors.  
Currently you can only define java or javadoc templates.  I would like to be 
able to define a new template type different from java or javadoc which could 
be used in a new non-Java partition.   For example, I would like to define a 
template of type SQLJ that would contain a template for a valid #sql clause.
This is now possible with the org.eclipse.ui.editors.templates extension point.
Any editor may choose to support a specific context type (which map to
partitions in many ways), and can offer contributed templates, or even template
resolvers if it chooses so.

The java editor currently does not support any other context types, but it does
not support other languages either.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>when changing javaBuildPath properties in the project properties page, and
closing the page, only the JavaBuilder gets executed. This could be a problem 
especially if there exists other builders which do bytecode manipulation, or  
depend on class file execution, since not running them leaves the project in an 
unstable state.
Martin, can you please comment.
What I do is a 'serRawClasspath', JCore does the rest. Moving to JCore for comments.

My guess is that other builders that depend on the classpath of a Java project
should listen to Java element deltas (where classpath changes are reported), and
not rely that a full build of a project is performed.

martin's guess is right, the JavaBuilder indeed checks for classpath change in 
the delta.
The point is that changing the classpath causes an implicit full_build with 
javaBuilder being the only builder to run, which is inconsistent. 

Either : 
1) document this behaviour for builder writters (who should look for a resource 
change with path = projectroot + ".classpath", or
2) run a full build in case of classpath change 

Setting a classpath doesn't trigger a build per se. It is only a side effect of 
JDTCore touching the .classpath file, creating thus a resource change which in 
turn causes builder(s) to run whenever platform decides (automatically or when 
user explicitly build).




Our Java builder then decides to perform a full build internally since it 
doesn't want to get into an incremental mode for such a change.

As long as subsequent builders are properly observing resource changes, then 
will correctly react to a classpath change. If they want to know how the 
classpath did change, then additional Java delta listeners should be used.

The .classpath file is an internal artifact and should remain as such.

If you are seeing a scenario where the platform doesn't correctly trigger all 
downstream builders when the Java builder is invoked, then you should reopen 
this defect and reassign it to Platform/Core. JDT/Core doesn't trigger any 
build action, it only reacts to a build request.</WithStack>

should listen to Java element deltas (where classpath changes are reported), and
not rely that a full build of a project is performed.

martin's guess is right, the JavaBuilder indeed checks for classpath change in 
the delta.
The point is that changing the classpath causes an implicit full_build with 
javaBuilder being the only builder to run, which is inconsistent. 

Either : 
1) document this behaviour for builder writters (who should look for a resource 
change with path = projectroot + ".classpath", or
2) run a full build in case of classpath change 

Setting a classpath doesn't trigger a build per se. It is only a side effect of 
JDTCore touching the .classpath file, creating thus a resource change which in 
turn causes builder(s) to run whenever platform decides (automatically or when 
user explicitly build).




Our Java builder then decides to perform a full build internally since it 
doesn't want to get into an incremental mode for such a change.

As long as subsequent builders are properly observing resource changes, then 
will correctly react to a classpath change. If they want to know how the 
classpath did change, then additional Java delta listeners should be used.

The .classpath file is an internal artifact and should remain as such.

If you are seeing a scenario where the platform doesn't correctly trigger all 
downstream builders when the Java builder is invoked, then you should reopen 
this defect and reassign it to Platform/Core. JDT/Core doesn't trigger any 
build action, it only reacts to a build request.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>When a percflow aspect is woven into source code from a jar using the aspectPath
compiler option, it produces only one instance of the aspect for each entrypoint
defined in the source code.
This bug needs a self-contained example in order to be verified and fixed.  Here
are two examples of bug reports for similar bugs that contained good examples:

test project with build.xml

Here's a test case that demonstrates the bug.  The default ant target tests the
aspect code first compiled along with the test and then tests a second time
with the aspect in a jar and the testcase compiled with the jar in the aspect
path.

To use the build.xml in this project, you'll need to create a lib folder in the
project containing aspectjrt.jar, aspecttools.jar, and junit.jar.  Also, in
order for the ant tasks to work, it will be a good idea to drop junit jar in
ANT_HOME/lib

The results of both tests can be found in html form under ./dist/junit_output

This is a great test case and easy to reproduce.  I've raised this to a P2 bug.
 The general problem is that any code that extends an abstract aspect from a
.jar file does not inherit the per-clause from the super-aspect, so all such
aspects behave like persingletons.  This is true for percflow, pertarget and
perthis.

The simple work-around is to explicitly include the per-clause in the concrete
aspects declaration, i.e.:
    aspect MyTestPerCFlowEntryPoint extends PerCFlowCompileFromJar     
             percflow(topOfFlow())  {

The bug is now fixed in the tree and should be in the 1.1.1 release.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hi, 

It seems that TableLabelProvider.getColumText() must return an empty string and
not null to indicate no text in the cell. The documentation doesn't say, and
it's not totally obvious - for instance a null image indicates no image. 

I wouldn't even mention it except the exception that's thrown isn't easily
traceable to the root cause: 

org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.AssertionFailedException: assertion failed:
The application has not been initialized.

Which is pretty confusing.
The javadoc for getColumnText states:

     * @return String or or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if there is no text for the 
     *  given object at columnIndex


If returning null causes errors, please enter a bug report against the component
that is not correctly handling null (which according to spec it must handle).</WithStack>

This bug should be reopened, because bidi-specific problems appear in Combo again. This is caused by change base GTK widget, used by Combo,  from GtkCombo to GtkComboBox.
I don't touch here general GTK problems with contextual ordering of the text and dynamic alignment in GTK text widgets. Problems, specific for SWT Combo, consist in wrong alignment of drop-down list's content and wrong alignment of the text, which appears in not-editable Combo's cell view (see attachments). Reason: correct text direction isn't set for corresponding GTK widgets. To change their direction, we need found and save handles of these widgets. Case of cell view from not-editable Combo is more simple: its handle can be found in the list of GtkComboBox children.  What about drop-down list, it is released inside additional toplevel Window. Handle to this Window can be found by comparing lists of toplevels before and after creating GtkComboBox.
Our suggestions can be found in attachments as diff files, which are done on the base of corresponding sources from 3.4M2.

After an un-install, we completely removed the directory and the problem still 
happens, so this is not a case of some remnant from the first install remaining.
This is a problem with the saved state in the workpace.

The workarounds we currently have are:
1) Install to a different location
2) Delete the workspace/.metadata/.config directory.

Marked this as major since it is quite ugly for our customers since one you get 
into the looping state, your only recourse is to kill the eclipse.exe and 
javaw.exe processes.
This bug should be fixed once we move the config state out of the workspace.
We have submitted a patch to the Core team and are waiting for its integration 
in a build.
I managed to get a different scenario that also exhibits the launcher loop:

1. install a new feature to a different site (say, c:\newEclipse)
2. add a .link (in the links directory) to this new site 
3. restart eclipse.
4. the above results in an infinite restarting loop
A fix for 2.1.2 is risky: we don't have a full understanding of the cause and 
the code fixes would involve touching very sensitive code in the startup 
process.
The workarounds mentioned by Jeff should be fine. We will need to add them to 
the README.
I have a similar problem, if u have a solution please let me know.

    <WithStack>Overview :
    Using FormLayout. I have a bunch of widgets in a composite. I dispose a few
and try to layout the composite, or close the editor containing the composite. I
get the SWTException: Widget is disposed.

Reproduction Steps : 
    As detailed above

Frequency :
    Often, not always. I Could not narrow down the scenario completely. 

Version :
    Noticed on 2.0.2 and 2.1.1

Example Stacktrace:
org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Widget is disposed

After doing the following actions:
1. Got new synch info via Live Synch view
2. Pressed "Conflicts" button
==&gt; multiple (&gt; 3) password request dialogs were presented

If the CVS client automatcally retries to login instead of waiting for the first
password query to be answered by the user the account probably gets disabled
after the three automatic tries. This is bad since I can now no longer work
until my account gets reset by the administrator. Even worse. If I startup
Eclipse and it first tries the old invalid password more than once the opened
account gets closed again.

Note:
- I did not receive a request that my password has expired
- I did not get any useful message why my password was rejected
- nothing in .log
I don't know what initially triggered the client to ask for the password. Can
you see this in some server log? I already asked help-infra to check their logs.

I'm pretty sure that the multiple password word dialogs were caused by the
experimental Quick Diff provider example (see bug 39812). Since this plug-in is
only experimental the problem might go away when this feature is provided by the
Team team. Is code in CVS core which prevents parallel logins while already one
password request is underway? If this is not the case then this is a real
problem especially with background jobs.

We found this last Friday as well. I will submit a fix for tomorrow 
integration build. This loophole has always existed, because we don't 
protected the login sequence for cancellation. With the new job support 
cancellation happens a lot more frequently.

To see the CVS logs, in the CVS preferences page there is a new option to turn 
on protocol logging and output to stdout.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 41161 ***
I'm actually re-opening this one because although related to 41161 it highlights
another point. Login prompting is not serialized. You won't really see this with
the current Team core because we don't perform CVS operations concurrently.

This is one of the problems with the sample quick diff provider - it access team
code that is not thread safe!

For the next integration build I have fixed a major problem with quick
cancellation requests which also locked you out of an account.
In my case the account first worked i.e. password was correct and account not
locked: I got synch info and a file was compared with the server) and then I got
about 5(!) password entry dialogs (which I think resulted in the locked
account). So the main question is why was a wrong password sent to the server
and/or the account locked after working a minute before?

I then got a new password form the webmaster, disabled CVS quick diff prototype,
CVS decorators, and all CVS background stuff, went to the CVS Repository view
and expanded HEAD. The password dialog came up (OK), I entered the new password
and in the server log we saw several invalid attempts being tried and the
account got locked again. Only after the webmaster unlocked and I tried again
with the password that was now stored in the keyring I was able to connect again.

Kim Moir was watching the server log.

I think this is a critical bug since I was not able to work with the server for
a whole day.
This is a blocker. No idea why it thinks the account has to been locked. This
morning I was catching up and again out of nowhere was presented with the
password dialog though the password obviously was not wrong: when Kim unlocked
the account I could work again even without entering any password.

My first guess was that there's a limit on connections per account (since I was
also performing CVS operations in parallel on the build machine) but according
to Kim there are no such restrictions.

Here's the log created by CVS when the connection failed - not sure whether this
helps.

We haven't touch any code in this area for a long while. It is strange that it's
suddenly happening so frequently now even with the background jobs. I will go
talk to Kim and see if she has changed some configuration parameters on the server. 

The other possible problem could be with some of the core changes and how they
may affect the key ring file. Obviously if the password is never wrong then you
should never be locked out in the first place.
Is it possible that accessing CVS from two different accounts at the same time
(maybe even same resources) might confuse the client e.g. because some message
or warning is sent by the server?

I have experienced the pain of this problem yesterday very similar to Dani's 
experience. I was in the process of comparing changes and committing and then 
the account was locked.
The scenario Darin explains was also the one that locked my account the first time:
I was synchronizing with remote in the background (new live synch view) and
during this process I compared a local file with its CVS content. Background
fetching and operation preferences were disabled (work in progress page).

I upgraded openssh on dev to 3.5p1-6.9 on August 5. This upgrade addressed a
security issue where pam modules were ignored in certain cases.

From Redhat's security page...

https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-222.html

When configured to allow password-based or challenge-response
authentication, sshd (the OpenSSH server) uses PAM (Pluggable
Authentication Modules) to verify the user's password. Under certain
conditions, OpenSSH versions prior to 3.6.1p1 reject an invalid
authentication attempt without first attempting authentication using PAM.

However, I inadvertently had an extra line in my in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  The
line 

auth required /lib/security/pam_tally.so deny=5 reset no_magic_root

where there should have only be a line like this....

account required /lib/security/pam_tally.so deny=5 reset no_magic_root

This module locks accounts if they exceed five password failures so it may have
been the source of the problem.  Once I fixed this, the problem went away. 
However, there still seems to be issues with the new rpm because an indication
of authentication failure is written to /var/log/messages when the user
authenticates via ssh both successfully and unsuccessfully.  

This is reflected in bug

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=102174
Thanks Kim. 

Can both Darin and Daniel confirm that you aren't experiencing this problem
anymore? Can we close this?
Doesn't this only explain why the account got locked? Why was a wrong password
sent to the server? I would expect the CVS client to work even if a user account
gets locked after 1 wrong try (of course its then the users fault if he enters a
wrong password).
I understood from Kim that correct passwords were actually being sent however 
the retry count was being incremented anyway. 

As a result of this and another similar bug, we have fixed two areas of the 
CVS plugin that could result in incorrect passwords being sent:

1. It used to be possible to interrupt an SSH login sequence. This has been 
fixed and login sequences are protected against cancellation.

2. We have serialized login to the same repo. This will handle the cases where 
multiple threads try and login with incorrect passwords, thus possibly locking 
out the user.
OK. I enabled CVS decorators and background fetching in the Synch view and did
not experience a password related problem so far.
I am experiencing the same problems as mentioned above.  When I try to
synchronize with a remote CVS server (running CVSNT), sometimes the sync
proceeds correctly.  At other times the "authentication failed" popup dialog
would appear and prompt me for a password.  I am very sure I have entered the
CVS password correctly, although the password prompt keeps re-appearing.  After
a few tries my account gets locked on the CVS server, and I can't proceed to
work until an administrator unlocks my account.  Here are the relevant information:

Client machine: Windows XP
CVS server: Windows 2000
Eclipse version: 3.0.1 
Build id: 200409161125

I would appreciate it if anyone can offer any suggestions/work-arounds. I am
re-opening this bug because, well, obviously, it's not working on my machine.
Please let me know if you need any additional information from me to try to
solve this.

Thanks!

until my account gets reset by the administrator. Even worse. If I startup
Eclipse and it first tries the old invalid password more than once the opened
account gets closed again.

Note:
- I did not receive a request that my password has expired
- I did not get any useful message why my password was rejected
- nothing in .log
I don't know what initially triggered the client to ask for the password. Can
you see this in some server log? I already asked help-infra to check their logs.

I'm pretty sure that the multiple password word dialogs were caused by the
experimental Quick Diff provider example (see bug 39812). Since this plug-in is
only experimental the problem might go away when this feature is provided by the
Team team. Is code in CVS core which prevents parallel logins while already one
password request is underway? If this is not the case then this is a real
problem especially with background jobs.

We found this last Friday as well. I will submit a fix for tomorrow 
integration build. This loophole has always existed, because we don't 
protected the login sequence for cancellation. With the new job support 
cancellation happens a lot more frequently.

To see the CVS logs, in the CVS preferences page there is a new option to turn 
on protocol logging and output to stdout.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 41161 ***
I'm actually re-opening this one because although related to 41161 it highlights
another point. Login prompting is not serialized. You won't really see this with
the current Team core because we don't perform CVS operations concurrently.

This is one of the problems with the sample quick diff provider - it access team
code that is not thread safe!

For the next integration build I have fixed a major problem with quick
cancellation requests which also locked you out of an account.
In my case the account first worked i.e. password was correct and account not
locked: I got synch info and a file was compared with the server) and then I got
about 5(!) password entry dialogs (which I think resulted in the locked
account). So the main question is why was a wrong password sent to the server
and/or the account locked after working a minute before?

I then got a new password form the webmaster, disabled CVS quick diff prototype,
CVS decorators, and all CVS background stuff, went to the CVS Repository view
and expanded HEAD. The password dialog came up (OK), I entered the new password
and in the server log we saw several invalid attempts being tried and the
account got locked again. Only after the webmaster unlocked and I tried again
with the password that was now stored in the keyring I was able to connect again.

Kim Moir was watching the server log.

I think this is a critical bug since I was not able to work with the server for
a whole day.
This is a blocker. No idea why it thinks the account has to been locked. This
morning I was catching up and again out of nowhere was presented with the
password dialog though the password obviously was not wrong: when Kim unlocked
the account I could work again even without entering any password.

My first guess was that there's a limit on connections per account (since I was
also performing CVS operations in parallel on the build machine) but according
to Kim there are no such restrictions.

Here's the log created by CVS when the connection failed - not sure whether this
helps.

!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.ui 4 0 Aug 12, 2003 12:49:51.218
!MESSAGE Cannot connect to host

!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.ui 4 0 Aug 12, 2003 12:59:33.31
!MESSAGE Authentication error: Invalid username, password, host or repository
!STACK 1


We haven't touch any code in this area for a long while. It is strange that it's
suddenly happening so frequently now even with the background jobs. I will go
talk to Kim and see if she has changed some configuration parameters on the server. 

The other possible problem could be with some of the core changes and how they
may affect the key ring file. Obviously if the password is never wrong then you
should never be locked out in the first place.
Is it possible that accessing CVS from two different accounts at the same time
(maybe even same resources) might confuse the client e.g. because some message
or warning is sent by the server?

I have experienced the pain of this problem yesterday very similar to Dani's 
experience. I was in the process of comparing changes and committing and then 
the account was locked.
The scenario Darin explains was also the one that locked my account the first time:
I was synchronizing with remote in the background (new live synch view) and
during this process I compared a local file with its CVS content. Background
fetching and operation preferences were disabled (work in progress page).

I upgraded openssh on dev to 3.5p1-6.9 on August 5. This upgrade addressed a
security issue where pam modules were ignored in certain cases.

From Redhat's security page...

https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-222.html

When configured to allow password-based or challenge-response
authentication, sshd (the OpenSSH server) uses PAM (Pluggable
Authentication Modules) to verify the user's password. Under certain
conditions, OpenSSH versions prior to 3.6.1p1 reject an invalid
authentication attempt without first attempting authentication using PAM.

However, I inadvertently had an extra line in my in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  The
line 

auth required /lib/security/pam_tally.so deny=5 reset no_magic_root

where there should have only be a line like this....

account required /lib/security/pam_tally.so deny=5 reset no_magic_root

This module locks accounts if they exceed five password failures so it may have
been the source of the problem.  Once I fixed this, the problem went away. 
However, there still seems to be issues with the new rpm because an indication
of authentication failure is written to /var/log/messages when the user
authenticates via ssh both successfully and unsuccessfully.  

This is reflected in bug

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=102174
Thanks Kim. 

Can both Darin and Daniel confirm that you aren't experiencing this problem
anymore? Can we close this?
Doesn't this only explain why the account got locked? Why was a wrong password
sent to the server? I would expect the CVS client to work even if a user account
gets locked after 1 wrong try (of course its then the users fault if he enters a
wrong password).
I understood from Kim that correct passwords were actually being sent however 
the retry count was being incremented anyway. 

As a result of this and another similar bug, we have fixed two areas of the 
CVS plugin that could result in incorrect passwords being sent:

1. It used to be possible to interrupt an SSH login sequence. This has been 
fixed and login sequences are protected against cancellation.

2. We have serialized login to the same repo. This will handle the cases where 
multiple threads try and login with incorrect passwords, thus possibly locking 
out the user.
OK. I enabled CVS decorators and background fetching in the Synch view and did
not experience a password related problem so far.
I am experiencing the same problems as mentioned above.  When I try to
synchronize with a remote CVS server (running CVSNT), sometimes the sync
proceeds correctly.  At other times the "authentication failed" popup dialog
would appear and prompt me for a password.  I am very sure I have entered the
CVS password correctly, although the password prompt keeps re-appearing.  After
a few tries my account gets locked on the CVS server, and I can't proceed to
work until an administrator unlocks my account.  Here are the relevant information:

Client machine: Windows XP
CVS server: Windows 2000
Eclipse version: 3.0.1 
Build id: 200409161125

I would appreciate it if anyone can offer any suggestions/work-arounds. I am
re-opening this bug because, well, obviously, it's not working on my machine.
Please let me know if you need any additional information from me to try to
solve this.

Thanks!

Intresting, according to the JavaDoc, the type parameter should be
SWT.MULTI. When creating the Text according to :

final Text text = new Text (shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.MULTI);

the append method does not work properly. 
Then problem is that on Windows, when there is no room for the text to be 
visible, it is not even inserted into the control.  Hence, no SWT.Modify is 
issued.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>The component Text has a fix for updating the controls text 
when in SWT.MULTI-mode. The fix sends a message to the control,
telling it that the text has changed. 
This fix is not included in the append-method.
The work around is not necessary in the append case as the following code 
demonstrates:

import org.eclipse.swt.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;

public class PR_41370 {

public static void main (String [] args) {
	Display display = new Display ();
	Shell shell = new Shell (display);
	final Text text = new Text (shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.V_SCROLL | 
SWT.H_SCROLL);
	text.addListener (SWT.Modify, new Listener () {
		public void handleEvent (Event e) {
			System.out.println ("Modify: " + text.getText ());
		}
	});
	text.setText ("Hello");
	text.append (" There!");
	text.pack ();

    <WithStack>I don't seem to be able to suspend system threads with the threads and monitors 
view so that i can detect deadlocks in system threads.

I really want that because currently RMI threads are System threads and i have 
a lot of RMI threads running and they are deadlocking somehow. But i can't see 
this with the current threads and monitors.

So i there should be an options that i can also say: use system threads. Or 
that i can seelect the threads and sya detect/use these threads.
Luc, can you provide any instructions/details on this?
We filter out the system thread from the thread &amp; monitor view because we
thought they were irrelevent for the user. Usually, the system threads don't
execute user code.

There no way in the current implementation to display the system thread in the
thread &amp; monitor view.
We should be able to add an option to display them if needed (or just remove the
filter).

Darin W: do we want to add a preference in the view ? May be something like the
'show constants, show static, ...' in the variable view.
I would just remove the filter (i.e. do not filter any threads). It avoids 
having to (yet) add another option :-)
Fixed.
I removed the filter.

Changes in MonitorManager and MonitorQuitAction.

How much memory do you give Eclipse (using -vmargs -Xmx)?
Do you have a builder running on save which might leak?

The Text editor in Eclipse. Or whatever editor that pops up when I double click

Default. 

If you look at the file size, Eclipse should be able to handle this

No, on the contrary. I disabled rebuild upon changed resources last week,

public class TestA {

given fFoo as an IField, IField.getConstant() returns null. How is this 
supposed to work?
It works only if the type is an interface, but it reports a char[] in case the
field is from source. This is clearly a bug according to the doc.

I think we have two bugs.
One in the doc and one in the implementation.
1) in the doc, the getConstant() method should specify that a constant is
returned only if the field is static and final or if the field is the field of
an interface type.
2) The implementation should convert the char[] to either an instance of a
subclass of Number or a String.

In your example, null is the proper answer, because this field is not a constant
field in the JLS meaning. Only static final fields can have a constant.
If you change it to:
public class TestA {	
	private static final int fFoo= 3;
}

You will get the char array char[] {'3'} for the return value of getConstant()
and this doesn't match the javadoc.
/**

 * @exception JavaModelException if this element does not exist or if an
 *      exception occurs while accessing its corresponding resource
 */
public Object getConstant() throws JavaModelException;

That's fair. Is there another way aside from getConstant() to see what the 
value of a field is set to? For the source action "Generate constructor using 
fields..." I want to include final fields in the list of possible fields to 
choose to be initialized in an auto-generated constructor, but only if this 
field hasn't already been initialized. 
Moreover the constant could be converted to a Boolean instance or a Character
instance and these are not either a subclass of Number or a String. So the
javadoc should definitely be fixed. We might want to say that the constant is
converted to the proper wrapper type.

To answer your question, I don't think it is possible to do it using the IField.
If you use the DOM/AST API, it is easy to find out if a field has an initializer.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
In your example, you won't get a constant, but for static final fields or 
interface's fields you will get the right constant and not a char[] anymore.

    <WithStack>Overview :
     I have added about 400 controls to a composite. When the layout set is 
FormLayout, the computation of position of controls takes really long time, and
never seems to end.

Reproduction steps:
     Add about 250 or more controls to a single parent composite. Assign
FormData, and try to .layout. As the algorithm starts computing positions, and
the child index goes up, the perchild position computing time goes up exponentially.

Version :
     Found it in 2.1.1 and 2.0.2
This has already been fixed.  Please get the latest SWT from CVS and try it 
out.  If the problem is still there, then reopen this bugzilla report with 
some sample code that shows the problem.  Thanks.</WithStack>

This will also cause problems for translations like French, since you will also 
have to match the gender (un/une).. and there is no way to determine what 
gender the type will be. Best to avoid using the word "a" altogether if 
possible.

be "... an External Java Application ...". You might be able to re-word this to 
avoid having to decide when to add the 'n'.

I was trying to cancel a job that was running in the progress view. I was going
a bit balistic on the cancel button because the job wasn't terminating as
quickly as I would like. Here is the stack trace:

Do you have a more complete trace? This doesn't show which class the NPE was 
in.
It was in the ProgressView::createCancelAction() method. 

	private void createCancelAction() {
			cancelAction = new Action(ProgressMessages.getString
("ProgressView.CancelAction")) {//$NON-NLS-1$
	/* (non-Javadoc)
	 * @see org.eclipse.jface.action.Action#run()
	 */
			public void run() {
				JobInfo element = getSelectedInfo();
====&gt; element was NULL		element.getJob().cancel();

			}

		};
	}


This shouldn't be possible because of the menuAboutToShow callback:

cancelAction.setEnabled(false);
deleteAction.setEnabled(false);
showErrorAction.setEnabled(false);
JobInfo info = getSelectedInfo();
if (info == null) {
	return;
}

Do you have more details as to what you were doing when you managed to invoke 
this? I suspect there is a condition that menuAboutToShow is not suffecient 
for.
This just happened again. The call to getSelectedInfo() is null. Just a guess, 
but if the view is being updated by a job then the selection can change 
between the aboutToShow and the action being run?

Re: Skeptical that we can safely patch existing static initializers
	

	

Its interesting because technically speaking, some flavour of this is true today
in Eclipse.  Say plugin P.startup() looks like...
 P.startup()  {
  Foo.initialize();
  Bar.start();
  ...
 }
The static clinit() and initialize() or start() for Foo and Bar (respecitively)
cannot rely on P being fully activated since they are used in the process of
activating P, perhaps unknown to them.  In particular, Foo.initialize() will not
be able to take advantage of whatever Bar.start() does.

The case you point out is more subtle.  Basically, once someone has attempted
the first clinit(), that class will not be fully initialized for the remainder
of the activation.  In the current Eclipse the trigger is classload and infact
the class that triggered the startup can be loaded/run as part of the startup
sequence.  We simply check after doing the activation to see if the class we
were about to load was loaded for us.  Since people can try to load a class many
times this works.  In your case the system makes it impossible to call clinit()
more than once. 

All I can think right now is "Damn!  There must be a way!"

As for using the classloader, this is what we do currently.  It is "ok" but has
some bad characteristics
- there is no way (that we know of) to catch class init events.  The closest we
can get is classload.  Classes are loaded for many reason (e.g., verification of
other classes). We are really only interested in activation when code is
actually being run, not just loaded.
- The net result of this is eager activation and too much code loaded.  It is a
sort of self-perpetuating model.  The more you load the more you activate.  The
more you activate, the more you load...
- There are some subtle concurrency issues since classloaders are at least
partially synchronized.  We may have worked through most of these but then again
maybe not.  

Please continue to think about it and see what you can come up with.  Pascal,
can you chat with Chris and perhaps a VM guy (e.g., GAC) to see what you can see.

Pascal,

I want to thank you again for giving me a hard deadline. It is so much easier to
say "no" to other requests when your deadline is approaching.

I may not understand what you're asking for, but I fear that in general it is
not safe to patch an existing static initalizer to call "new
Plugin().startup()". Assume you prepend the startup call, the startup call will
fail if it references a variable which is initialized later in static
initializer. Consider the following:

&gt; cat FirstLoad.java
import java.util.Hashtable;
import Plugin;

public class FirstLoad {
    static public Hashtable hashTable = null;

    static public void insertedCode() {
        Plugin plugin = new Plugin();
        plugin.startup();
    }

    static {
        insertedCode(); // references hashTable
        hashTable = new Hashtable();
    }
}

&gt; cat Plugin.java
import FirstLoad;

public class Plugin {
    public void startup() {
        FirstLoad.hashTable.put("foo","bar");
        System.out.println("&gt;&gt; Plugin Started");
    }
}

The inverse also holds, if you append instead of prepend the startup call, have
the static initializer reference a variable initialized by the startup call.

Instead of patching the initializer, would it possible to modify the ClassLoader
to realizer it is loading the 1st class from a plugin and do the startup call
prior to loading the class?

Keith
Auto-activation has is being done explicitly in the Eclipse adaptor 
classloaders.  When we detect that we've failed to find the desired class 
anywhere else (import and required bundles) and are about to look in self, we 
optimistically auto-activate (if required) expecting that we will find the 
desired class.  There is the slim chance that we will not and thus will have 
activated eagerly but this is rare.  It should only happen in cases where 
someone is really looking up a bogus class or where there is package splitting.

    <WithStack>Using the latest and greatest of the most supported tool-chain (gcc-3.3,

    <WithStack>Build errors are sorted on the Tasks view such that Make errors come first, 
whereas on a console they would come last.

Take for example the following build log:
[X]  *** [Application2] Error 1
[X] ld  fatal:  Symbol referencing errors. No output written to Application2

The error from Make should come last (certainly last among the errors, if not 
after the warnings).  I think errors are sorted by line number, but Make 
provides no line information of course (and the linker error is assigned to 
line 0).

Also note the unnecessary extra space before the ***. (perhaps the reason for 
the sort?)
The text in the CBuild log is as follows:
ld: fatal:  Symbol referencing errors. No output written to Application2
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [Application2] Error 1
PR was targeted to the 2.0 release but not resolved, moving target to 2.1
The make errors now only appear if there are no other errors.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>AJDT has been ported to the new ASM API.  There were some problems with the 
info showing up on the old API, and some of the logic for determining it has 
changed.  

The following properties should be visible as overlays on nodes:
- runnables
- implementors
- modifiers
- visibility

Also ensure that imports show up identically to the JDT.
runnables/modifiers and visibility are all fixed.

What did you mean by implementors?
Mik, this is pretty old, and I'm not aware of any current problems here, so I'm
marking it as fixed. Please reopen if I've missed anything.

By "implementors" I meant the little blue triangle that you see when a method 
implements an abstract method in a superclass.  I think that it's green in the 
case of overrides, and blue in the case of imlements.  I know that the other 
overlays work, but am not sure if this one does.  Could you check?

As indicated in comment #3, overriders and implementors still don't work.

Start the debugger.
The UI is immediately frozen, the launched process is growing slowly,
and eating all the CPU of the processor it is running on,
but you have no way to suspend the main thread and see where it is.
After a while you get some updates on the debug view, but you still
can't act, all threads are shown as "not responding".

Note : this is not a CPU usage issue (SMP workstation). It just seems
that there is no temporary polling of the jdwp socket while doing
such kind of loops within the JRE... 

Platform : Eclipse 2.1.1
JRE : Sun 1.4.2
OS : XP
After searching a bit while I had a similar bug, it seems that
the followings things are needed:
-Xint so that the jre gets some control over the executed
 code. This is required if we don't want the debugger to be stalled.
-Additional logging org.eclipse.ui.internal.ExceptionHandler.log( Throwable )
 when adding a breakpoint to this method, and evaluating t.printStackTrace(),
 we get the proper information (provided -Xint was set and so the ui
 was not stalled by a pending debugger request)

in WorkbenchPlugin.log( String message, IStatus status )
(where there is the comment:
  //1FTUHE0: ITPCORE:ALL - API - Status &amp; logging - loss of semantic info),
there is the following stuff :

- getDefault().getLog().log(StatusUtil.newStatus(IStatus.ERROR, message, null));
  Puts a message in the log

- System.err.println(message + "\nReason:"); //$NON-NLS-1$
  Displays a "Reason:" string to stderr

- getDefault().getLog().log(status);
  Puts the stack trace in the log

- System.err.println(status.getMessage());
  Puts a simple message

This is a bit painful, because then the console displays :

Unhandled exception caught in event loop.
Reason:
java.lang.stackOverflowError

whereas the stack trace was available and displaying it whould be really
more efficient for developpers than having to look in the log file...

Note that the messagebox shown after is not useful without
Policy.DEBUG_OPEN_ERROR_DIALOG set...

So far many issues, I think they should be documented.
I'll write an article for eclipse.org site ;-)

  

I believe that the UI is unresponsive since we are attempting to update the 
view in the UI thread (once you suspend the thread). This may be helped once we 
have bug 16036 fixed.
I think that issue is not solved with the (fixed) bug
    https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16036
and I think there is a very pragmatic solution:
Add a configuration option at "Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; Debug":
    "Max StackFrames in Debug View" [ 100 ]
And If you are kind you may add a Debug-view context menu point:
    "Extended Stacktrace".
I think the stack layout should look like:

     topframe
     topframe-1
     topframe-2
     topframe-3
     .... omitted 10000 frames ...
     base frame+6
     base frame+5
     base frame+4
     base frame+3
     base frame+2
     base frame+1
     base frame+0
I think nobody is intressten in the ommited 10000 frames and
if so it he has to change the option or use the context menu.

Note I had (moderate) success debugging a stack overflow by setting an 
exception breakpoint for the StackOverflowException and also setting the the 
java thread stack size to 1000 using  -Xss1000. UI remained fairly responsive 
but I agree we should investigate possible improvements.
I know this trick, but I had no success with -Xss1M (=?= -X1000), on my
Athlon 1400 MHz, I used (=?= -X300k) and had a very long delay until 
something happend. 
This trick is not very scalable because if I set it to  -X100k I got a 
fast response -- because the Sun JVM bootclassloader had an stackoverflow 
error.
You agree you should investigate possible improvements: that sounds as you
don't like my suggested improvement. 
So I do some advertising (mle for president ;-) - my solution is:
 [*] More then a dirty fix, because it makes the stack trace more readable
 [*] Is a real extension of the current debug view (if the the context menu is
      extended), i.e. there is no functionallity lost.
 [*] It should become very simple to implement.
 [*] In remote debugging situation a very small stackdepth may become 
      configurated to improve debugger performance (due to reduced debugger 
      network traffic)
But I really have no idea how fine grained the JVM debugger API is: 
I asssume it is possible to request the stackdepth of a suspended thread and
each stackframe individual (or better intervalls of it). If that is not true
then everything is lost ... .

    <WithStack>For large projects, a developer is rarely going to "make all" from the root of 
their project.  That will typically perform a large load-build.  Load-builders 
are not our primary target users.

The average developer in a large project is much more likely to perform a "make 
all" in a subdir, or even a "make stub" in a subdir.  It is possible to setup 
these targets from the Make Targets view.  However to build them, the user must 
keep using the right-click action "Build" on that target in that view.  This is 
not nearly as convenient (and the view wastes precious screen space) as any of:
- Project &gt; Build project
- Ctrl-B
- Preferences &gt; Workbench &gt; Perform build automatically on resource mod = YES.
which perform "make -k".

The mechanism to specify "Build" is probably most possible within Make Targets 
view.  I suggest a default target "" added to the Make Targets view's root dir, 
and decorate it as the default target.  Then add a right-click action to make a 
different target the default.  Then the user can hide the Make Targets view and 
perform builds conveniently as above.

Similarly, the Make Targets view could come pre-populated with "all" and "clean 
all" targets which could be similarly decorated and redefinable to fit the 
user's needs.  Then a lot of the hidden voodoo magic becomes a little less 
hidden and a little more helpful.
This is being address in the "new" Make builder,
good feedback.

Dave, what do you think ?
New builder addresses immediated problem of not being able to change default
build targets, the rest could be handled as a feature request.
Verified on build 1.2.0.60:
The default build target is now user-specifiable, and clearly controllable.

Added bug43915 "Ctrl-B does not always build project" to track separately.

Added enhancement bug43917 "Synchronizing Make Build properties and Make

Could you please provide the whole test case?
Thanks.
I will have to try and recreate it the steps.  After the StackOverflow error, 
eclipse was not behaving correctly and had to be restarted.  
I had the class Browser.java (see attached).  I selected the following:

--start selection here
				webSite.addEventListener
(OleWebBrowser.ProgressChange, new OleListener() {
		public void handleEvent(OleEvent event) -- end selection here 
(before "}")

Then, I hit Ctrl+X, CTRL+Z, CTRL+S a few times and the error happened.  I 
can't make it happen every time but if I play with the CTRL+X, CTRL+Z, CTRL+S, 
eventually it happens.

I will also attach my preferences.

2) do ctrl + space at cursor location

    <WithStack>Currently in the Java Perspective if you right click on a folder in the 
Navigator you get the option of creating a New Project, Class, Interface, 
Package or Other. In order to create a new folder you have to go to Other, 
Simple, Folder.

Since I'm using the Navigator and not the Packages Viewer I would expect the 
folder creation to be trivial like it is in the Resources Perspective.
I have the following menu entries under New when selecting a folder in the 
Navigator: 

Project
Package
Class
Interface
Source Folder
Scrapbook Page
Folder                &lt;&lt;&lt;
File
Example
Other

Am I missing something ?
I'm using 2.1.1 and that happens in the Java Browsing perspective not Java 
perspective as I've mentioned above (sorry).
OK, the problem is that the workbench only supports customizing the New menu 
per perspective. Since the Projects view doesn't show folders we decided to 
not add it to the New menu. Otherwise user will create folders, but they don't 
show up in the view.

As long as the workbench doesn't provide better support for the new menu there 
is nothing we can do.

Moving to platform for comments.
There are currently no plans to work on this feature</WithStack>

What plugin are you talking about? There are a lot of eclipse ui plugins. I will
try to reproduce it.

It was most of the eclipse ui plugins. I'm working in another stream, but today 
I had to check some code from the HEAD stream. So I started that workspace, did 
a refresh with server (using the new sync view), there was a list of ui plugins 
that had changes, I just selected all of them, and did an update.
Unfortunately I could not reproduce. I suspect a JIT bug. The VM used was a IBM
JDK 1.3.1 VM.
Closed. The JIT in this VM is known for random NPEs.</WithStack>

Renaming problem report as I cannot get the previous error to happen consistently.

Here is a better example that shows the problem with getActiveShell

import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell;

public class ShellFocusTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		final Display display = new Display();
		Shell shell = new Shell(display);
		
		GridLayout layout = new GridLayout();
		shell.setLayout(layout);
		
		
		shell.setBounds(0,0,300,100);
		shell.open();
		System.out.println(shell.getDisplay().getActiveShell() == null);
		while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
			if (!display.readAndDispatch())
				display.sleep();
		}
		display.dispose();
	}
	
	
	
}

Tod, should I disregard the problem mention on comment #1 ?

I've tested both scenarios anyway, case 1 works fine for me.
Case 2 fails cause SWT will only be able to find the active shell after it gets
the focus. It means you will need to run a event loop after openning the shell
(this ensures that the Shell receives the focus in event).

After shell.open() add the line:
while (display.readAndDispatch());

On windows all this happens synchronously (my guess) that is why we don't have
this bug there, GTK on the another hand it all gets defered.

Not sure I can help you here. Is it really important for you to have this fixed ?



Yes - disregard the first test. This is important for us as we cannot get the 
active window easily without this code and the active window is used in many 
places in JFace.
A possible fix for this problem is to call bringToTop with true (force == true)
during Shell.open() if the display has just one shell.

Something like this:

public void open () {
	checkWidget ();
	setVisible (true);
	bringToTop (display.getShells().length == 1); //Hacky line
	if (!restoreFocus ()) {
...


Felipe, there is new API in GTK to get the active shell (in 2.0.6 we had to 
track it using the "hasFocus" field of Shell).  FH to investigate the API to 
see if it gives better results.
The only way to know whether a shell is active is to wait for the focus events
from GTK+, as this is handled by the window manager asynchronously (and it can
deny the request if it likes).  The new API in GTK+ simply tracks focus events,
which is what SWT is already doing.

Closing as WONTFIX.
"the active window is used in many places in JFace".

JFace and the workbench should avoid using getActive*.  Everybody should know
which window they're dealing with to begin with.</WithStack>
