    <WithStack>This method catches and discards Throwable.  It needs to be cleaned up.
I have moved ISafeRunnable.handleException outside the try/catch because it
caused rethrown cancelations to be lost.  See bug 45139 for details.
I restored the original code (before Equinox merge) and simplified the logging
section to use the runtime plug-in id.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>This is more of an annoyance than anything, but it would be really nice if the
Search Dialog box would restore the last selected tab between search attempts.

A typical use case for me would be searching for something and have that search
come up empty a number of times before I finally submit a search finds what I'm
looking for. If I'm doing a Java search, I have to select the Java search tab
every single time because the default behavior always actives the File search
tab. You get the idea.
Not exactly the same bug, but the resolution is that same. Please reopen if you
don't agree.

    <WithStack>This is a request to provide non-internal access to the dialogs used to create 
classpath entries within the JDT UI. These would be simple dialogs or perhaps 
even just helper methods (e.g. IClasspathEntry[] showExternalJARDialog(Shell 
shell)) that could be used to present the user with the same dialogs and 
return a classpath entry. Specifically, the dialogs that appear by clicking on 
the following buttons on the Java Build Path properties, Libraries tab:
  Add JARs...
  Add External JARs...
  Add Variable..
  Add Library...
  Add Class Folder...

Exposing these dialogs would allow downstream JDT users to create and edit 
classpath entries outside of the regular JDT dialogs. For instance, providing 
a UI to set a server's classpath in an editor.

Currently, this is done by duplicating the dialogs. Maintenance of duplicate 
dialogs is an issue, as well as a usability problem since the dialogs are 
inevitably different.
Martin, can you comment on the impact of making such dialogs API.
makes sense to add API here
Tim, where do you want to use the dialogs ?
New class 'BuildPathDialogAccess' is now offering access to dialogs to select an
configure class path entries and properties

In the plugin converter, when generating the Provided-Package entry, we add all
directories in the plug-in classpath that contain any files.

Should we include the META-INF directory in that list (as we do now)? I don't
see any value in doing that, and it is an extra entry that is not likely to be
used at all (at least not across bundles).
I agree. I put in because I've seen some weird case in wsad, but I think we 
should get rid of it until we understand better what was the real use case.
Code fix is in.

    <WithStack>Hey

Cannot print from eclipse platform.
The command print is in the menu item but dimmed and not enabled!

I've been searching for some info and found some infor relating to a prior bug
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8821
but it seems to me that bug was resolved.

So why can't I print from eclipse?

    <WithStack>At least, this was the case a week ago when I last checked.  As originally
designed, command should only reply that it is not enabled if its handler isn't
enabled.  And, there should be a strong correlation between enabled command and
enabled menu items.  As it is right now, all commands are always disabled.

I'm raising this as a bug to help us track this, and because John Arthorne (Bug
48083) has noticed the consequences of this problem.

I think this is a "major" part of the command functionality.  :P
ICommand no longer has isEnabled(), but the equivalent command.getAttributeValue("enabled") should 
work fine now.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Provide a read-only property -- availableInDialog -- on key bindings.  This
property should be available to developers, but not visible to the user.  It
indicates when a key binding is appropriate for use in the dialog.

(this enhancement is just so i don't forget)
This is part of my work for M8. 
I've committed changes allowing this property to be changed on the keys 
preference page, and to be read in from XML.  I still need to update the schema 
and doc -- advertising its existence.  I also need to provide the appropriate 
hooks for the key binding service to use this information. 
This service is provided, though the key binding resolution (including pieces 
of the command manager) are still broken. 
i wish i had of got to you a day earlier. i'm not sure what this change is (i'm not sure why one would have key bindings work on dialogs - its really the handler one cares about), but my big changes last night made it (almost) possible to have key bindings in dialogs. basically by tonight HandlerSubmission will be able to discriminate by dialog/main workbench window/or both for purposes of solving handlers for particular command ids.

it will require almost no code changes. perhaps we can talk about this tomorrow morning?

i disagree with this bug, and its fix. i think the fix should be reversed and the bug resolved as invalid.
I agree with Chris' proposed alternative, and Chris has rolled back these 
changes.  Closing as INVALID.

    <WithStack>Hello,
I would propose a feature we can find into WebMatrix and also into 
VisualStudio.Net; it is a collaborative feature : we can then access directly 
through an eclipse view in a perspective to the miscellaneous Eclipse forums, 
documentations, bug parade, plugins available, ...
I really think that kind of feature is important for Eclipse by accelarating 
the information exchange between users, developpers...

Basically you want Team to provide:
- bug tracking integration
- chat
- mail client for forums
- web browser
- documentation plugings? 
That is fine, but the Team component or Eclipse SDK, is the platform. We hope
that others (e.g. hint that you can help) will provide these tools. If there is
something in the platform that makes it impossible to build these tools, then
please open a bug report for the specific cases.

Or if you really think that Team should provide specific features, open
enhancement requests for each one. 
Re-Hello,
You know, my proposal is simply the proposal of an eclipse user from the 
beginning (2 years), who daily use Eclipse ;-) I'm also a user of Visual Studio 
(and web matrix), and even if I like at most Eclipse, I also know what I like 
in VisualStudio ;-) And I only tell you that for instance  the Community view 
in web matrix is very useful, and it could be very easily plugged into Eclipse 
as a view... The content of this view (see WebMatrix) is simply a list of the 
following features :
*ASP.NET Online -&gt; Eclipse.net online 
**web matrix online -&gt; eclipse platform online
**web site -&gt; eclipse.net
*ASP.NET ressources -&gt; Eclipse ressources
**ASP.NET books -&gt; Eclipse books and articles
**ASP.NET web hosting -&gt; Community projects for instance
*Web  Matrix forum
**general discussion
**bug report -&gt; could open the bug report in a browser not obligatory in 
eclipse!!!
*ASP.NET forums
** misc... forums (announcements, getting started, SWT, GEF, ...)
*ASP.NET newsgroup
** misc... eclipse.org.ui, eclipse.org.team, ...

We could also add another category for the plugins developped by users...

As you see, it is not a big issue... It is just providing a standardize view 
common for all the users, an entry point... I don't say that everything must be 
inside Eclipse (eg an internal web browser, an internal bug tracking 
system, ...), just a means to open the existing features offered onto the web 
site...obviously, it can be extended in the future...

As you see, it is not a big issue... It is just providing a standardize view

    <WithStack>I tried registering my own actions against the Forward and Back global 
actions, and my action doesnt seem to be invoked.

here is the code snippet:

// register with global action service.
IActionBars actionBars = introArea.getActionBars();
actionBars.setGlobalActionHandler(ActionFactory.FORWARD.getId(),forwardAction);
actionBars.setGlobalActionHandler(ActionFactory.BACK.getId(),backAction);

am I missing something? The above code does not enable any of the Forward or 
Back action in the Eclipse Navigate menu. If I use PREVIOUS and NEXT all words 
well.


thanks

nick, can you comment on this? 
Perhaps these methods haven't been implemented yet.
It's unclear that IIntroSite should extend IWorkbenchSite since it doesn't 
really belong to a page or a window.  I'd keep them separate for now, add what 
you need to IIntroSite, then look at refactoring it under one of the existing 
site interfaces later.

Huh?  Nick, did you mean that as a comment for Bug 49117?  And if so, did you
mean to assign this bug to me?
This seems to be related to bug 49117 since Mazen's code above is talking to 
the intro area.
I was guessing that setGlobalActionHandler on the IIntroArea's IIActionBars is 
not implemented, and that you were the one implementing this.

I assumed by intro area he meant the hacked-up version they were using
internally.  NONE of the new IIntro stuff should work at the moment, only the
interfaces have been checked in.  If PREVIOUS and NEXT are working for him he
must be using existing API.
Apologies for the confusion! :) 
Yes, Kim is right.. I opned this defect a while back when I was playing around 
with a hacked IIntroArea implemented as a view. I got the actionBars throught 
the Eclipse view and I tried registering these two global actions but the code 
didnt work. The defect is still valid, confusing but valid. 


and yes, the above code with PREVIOUS and NEXT actions works.
Is the intro area implemented as a view in the hacked up version?
If so, do the FORWARD and BACK actions get retargeted properly if registered in 
the view itself?  Note that the view must be the active part.

Nick,
yes, the IIntroArea was hacked up as a view in this defect. But lets get the 
IIntro stuff out of the picture. I have a view that has the above code 
snippet. I can override the NEXT and PREVIOUS actions from the Navigate menu, 
but I cant do that for the FORWARD and BACK actions. Am I missing something? 
Arent these actions global?

Yes, these are both retargetable and they both work for regular views.
Try the following:
- in the Package Explorer, select a project, package or folder
- Navigate &gt; Go Into
- Navigate &gt; Go To &gt; Back
- Navigate &gt; Go To &gt; Forward
- Navigate &gt; Go To &gt; Up

Note that these actions are different from the editor history navigation 
actions in the main toolbar, which are not retargetable.
The arrows in the Package Explorer's local toolbar -do- correspond to FORWARD 
and BACKWARD though.

Nick,
I guess that was my source of confusion. I was referring to what you 
call "editor history navigation actions in the main toolbar". ie: from main 
menu go to Navigate -&gt; Back / Forward.

You say that they are not retargetable, which is fine. I guess these are 
dedicated for editor hitory navigation, and you dont want to confuse that. ok. 
But then isnt it a bit confusing to make the Next and Previous (in the same 
drop down menu) retargettable? while the Back and Forward are not? Not only 
that, the Next and Previous are context sensistive, while the Back and Forward 
are not. Its just a bit confusing to absorb. Please correct me if Im wrong. 
Also, maybe I havent searched enough, but I could have sworn that I read in 
the javadoc somewhere taht the Forward and Back are part of the actions that 
can be retargetted.

    <WithStack>Bundle.getDataFile() should be mapped to the .metadata location of the 
underlying plugin.
However we need to be careful to the version number of the plugin.
Why is the version number an issue? 

Because we may have several plugins with the same id resolved at the same time, 
and that may not necessarily want to share the data.
This is for example already a pb with xerces for example.

However one conter argument to putting the number is that when I move from one 
version to higher version I loose the metadata...


Right. Just as note, the case you mention has always been true (I am not saying
it should not be improved). It seems that we kind assumed that "real" plug-ins
(the ones that used the Eclipse API) would always have extensions or extension
points, so (since this forced them to be singletons) that was not a problem.

A question: what would the location be for a bundle that does not have a global
name?


I would say it is in the same place than the eclipse metadata but instead we 
would use the long id?
in the first comment I think you were talking of the generation number? or did 
you realy mean version number?

I think we should just do whatever Eclipse does today. There are clearly 
problems when you have multiple versions of the same plugin  We can improve 
upon that in the future.
Is this still an issue?
Jeff you have mentioned an API that allows a plugin get access to a persistent 
storage area.  What is this API and what does eclipse currently map that 
directory too?

Right now the eclipse adaptor will map a File object returned by 
BundleContext.getDataFile() to the directory 
.metadata\bundles\&lt;bundle id&gt;\data\ 
of the workspace.

Where &lt;bundle id&gt; is the long bundle id, not the global bundle name.  This data 
area stays the same acrossed bundle updates so if you update a bundle the data 
area is not removed and is reused by the newly updated bundle.  Is this what 
you are looking for?  I think the eclipse api should map to the same 
directory.  Does this cause migration issues?  Should we really map the 
bundle's data area to the location used by the eclipse API?
Plugin.getStateLocation() is basically the same as BundleContext.getDataFile
("/").

Unfortunately as you point out we now have two places, the Eclipse and OSGi 
places.  Just like the URL stuff, the Eclipse implementation is a bit bogus 
because like much of Eclipse, I don't tihnk it handles multiple versions that 
well.   However the OSGi mechanism is brittle with respect to plugin install 
order.  For example, it is extremely common for people to keep the same 
workspace (and thus metadata/bundle state area) but run different Eclipse 
biulds, or confgiruations on it.  I suspect (though it should be verified) that 
losing this would be annoying.

For example, I think the UI keeps the workbench layout etc in there somewhere.  
Losing all your windows when you change builds would be less than optimal.
Not sure what to do
We have decided to make the Bundle data location to be located under the 
configuration location.  This defect suggests it should be under the .metadata 
which is the under the instance location.  This will not be fixed.</WithStack>

1. modify the file associations (I add 'Ant Editor' to *.xml)
2. export the preferences
3. launch eclipse on a new workspace
4. import the preferences
The file associations preference page contains the default values
Another one to look at.... 
This bug also happens on Windows XP. I am currently investigating.

I am using:
Eclipse Platform
Version: 3.0.0
Build id: 200404290010
After tracing the code, here are my observations:

The problem is that the editorRegisry was only being updated on start up, which
means that the file associations are loaded from the registry on start up only.
As a consequence, importing preferences that contain file associations had no
effect until you restarted the workbench (you should see all the imported
setting if you just restart the workbench).

I am adding code to PlatformUIPreferenceListener to update the registry when a
preference has changed (thanks to Tod's help :) ).

A patch will follow shortly. 

Created attachment 10189
File associations preferences patch

Added an "initializeFromStorage()" call to PlatformUIPreferenceListener class
when file associations preferences have changed.
Re-assigning to Doug so you can use the patch if he decides to.
oops. If he decides to use it... :)
I undid some of the formatting changes in the listener -- just so that the diff 
is a bit clearer.  Tested the code, and it seems to work for the test case 
given. 
 
Thanks for your help.... 
The fixes cause a regression in behaviour.  Importing a preference file 
displays a dialog complaining the editor associations could not be imported.  
Tracing through the code, it is caused by 
 
        java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/dpollock/Source/Eclipse/Workspaces/SelfHosted/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/resourcetypes.xml 
        (No such file or directory) 
 
On line 643 of EditorRegistry. 
Ines: could you look at this please? 
Created attachment 10405
Preference File to Import
Yes, I was able to reproduce the problem just now. The patch has also introduced
another regression (duplicating the Editor Selection list).
I have found the problem and I am currently investigating a solution.
I am looking for a method that updates the "EditorRegistry". The
"getEditorRegistry().initializeFromStorage()" serves a different purpose and
introduces other complications. I logged another bug report (Bug 61449) to
obtain more information about which method should be used in this case.
Reverted the fix. 
Created attachment 10649
Revised patch to "org.eclipse.ui.workbench"

Ines: can you clean this up.
Created attachment 10659
Patch for the file association issues

Here is a cleaner version of the latest patch. I also added code to handle
external editor associations. It seems to work. The only caveat is that the

1. modify the file associations (I add 'Ant Editor' to *.xml)
2. export the preferences
3. launch eclipse on a new workspace
4. import the preferences
The file associations preference page contains the default values
Another one to look at.... 
This bug also happens on Windows XP. I am currently investigating.

I am using:
Eclipse Platform
Version: 3.0.0
Build id: 200404290010
After tracing the code, here are my observations:

The problem is that the editorRegisry was only being updated on start up, which
means that the file associations are loaded from the registry on start up only.
As a consequence, importing preferences that contain file associations had no
effect until you restarted the workbench (you should see all the imported
setting if you just restart the workbench).

I am adding code to PlatformUIPreferenceListener to update the registry when a
preference has changed (thanks to Tod's help :) ).

A patch will follow shortly.

File associations preferences patch

Added an "initializeFromStorage()" call to PlatformUIPreferenceListener class
when file associations preferences have changed.
Re-assigning to Doug so you can use the patch if he decides to.
oops. If he decides to use it... :)
I undid some of the formatting changes in the listener -- just so that the diff 
is a bit clearer.  Tested the code, and it seems to work for the test case 
given. 
 
Thanks for your help.... 
The fixes cause a regression in behaviour.  Importing a preference file 
displays a dialog complaining the editor associations could not be imported.  
Tracing through the code, it is caused by 
 
        java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/dpollock/Source/Eclipse/Workspaces/SelfHosted/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/resourcetypes.xml 
        (No such file or directory) 
 
On line 643 of EditorRegistry. 
Ines: could you look at this please? 
Created attachment 10405
Preference File to Import
Yes, I was able to reproduce the problem just now. The patch has also introduced
another regression (duplicating the Editor Selection list).
I have found the problem and I am currently investigating a solution.
I am looking for a method that updates the "EditorRegistry". The
"getEditorRegistry().initializeFromStorage()" serves a different purpose and
introduces other complications. I logged another bug report (Bug 61449) to
obtain more information about which method should be used in this case.
Reverted the fix. 
Created attachment 10649
Revised patch to "org.eclipse.ui.workbench"

Ines: can you clean this up.
Created attachment 10659
Patch for the file association issues

Here is a cleaner version of the latest patch. I also added code to handle
external editor associations. It seems to work. The only caveat is that the
preference file Doug attached contains random characters at the end that were
causing some problems.

    <WithStack>This report includes a description of my setup, a description of the problem, 
a description of the source of the problem, and a description of two possible 
solutions.

SETUP: My setup is a little complex.  I think that most of this is irrelevent, 
but I'm including it all just in case.

I'm running Eclipse 2.1.2 with CDT 1.2 on Windows XP.  I have a current cygwin 
installation (as of 2003-12-4) and prc-tools 2.3 installed (&lt;http://prc-
tools.sf.net&gt;).  I'm running from a drive (K:) that's mapped to my Documents 
directory (C:\Documents and Settings\Keith Rollin.PALMSOURCE\My Documents).  
My workspace (K:\Projects\Eclipse\plugins) is outside of my Eclipse directory 
(K:\Downloads\eclipse\2.1.2\eclipse).  I launch Eclipse with a shortcut that 
specifies the following command line: K:\Downloads\eclipse\2.1.2
\eclipse\eclipse.exe -data k:\Projects\Eclipse\plugins.  My runtime workspace 
is in the normal location relative to the main workspace 
(K:\Projects\Eclipse\runtime-workspace).  I am using the Eclipse for Palm OS 
plugin (&lt;http://www.redfelineninja.dsl.pipex.com/software.html&gt;) to debug Palm 
applications.  Because I'm developing extensions, most of my debugging is in a 
runtime IDE.  The problem I describe occurs both in the runtime IDE as well as 
the host IDE.

PROBLEM: The problem is that source files are not always found in the 
debugger.  Assume that I've developed a Palm application, have launched under 
the control of the Palm OS Emulator and the m68k-palmos-gdb debugger that 
comes with prc-tools, and that my Palm application has crashed and that I'm 
looking at a stack crawl in the debugger.  Clicking on a stack frame that 
corresponds to a function in my application results in a page saying that the 
source file cannot be found.

SOURCE: I think I've traced the problem to a couple of methods in 
CSourceLocator.  findFileByAbsolutePath() is given the path of a file to look 
for.  As part of its operation, it creates a File on that path, calls 
File.getCanonicalPath, and then passes the result to CSourceLocator.findFile
().  findFile iterates over all project members, looking for an IFile that has 
the same path.

The problem is that findFileByAbsolutePath is given a path where the drive 
letter is lower-case.  findFile also generates project item paths where the 
drive letter is lower-case.  However, the call to getCanonicalPath converts 
the lower-case drive letter to an upper-case drive letter, cause the strict 
string match between the target path and the project item paths to fail.

Eventually, it occurred to me that the paths being generated had a lower-case 
drive letter because I'd specified a lower-case drive letter in the command 
line in the shortcut I use to launch Eclipse.  Changing that, and changing the 
path to the runtime-workspace in my launch configuration (which appears to 
have been generated from the path I'd specified in the shortcut) fixed the 
problem.

As an interesting workaround, I also noticed that the source files could be 
found if my project was not in the workspace directory (that is, when I'd 
imported an existing project into my workspace from another location on my 
hard drive without actually copying the files into my workspace).  I never 
bothered to track down why this was so.

SOLUTION: One obvious fix to this problem would be to make more use of 
getCanonicalPath, thus generating consistant paths that could be compared 
against each other.  However, I have another suggestion.  While tracking down 
this bug, I noticed that the source-locator routines were given a simple file 
name (no path information), and were asked to find a file with that name in 
the project.  The algorithm used to perform this search involved iterating 
over the project, prefixing the file name with every possible path in the 
project, and then iterating over the project again looking for a file with 
that full path.  It seems to me that a much simpler approach would be to 
iterate over the project, and for each IFile, to see if the file name (without 
the path) matched the simple file name that was passed to the source locator.
PR was targeted to the 2.0 release but not resolved, moving target to 2.1
Moving the target milestone to 3.0.

Unfortunately, 'getCanonicalPath' doesn't work if the workspace is a symbolic 
link (bug 43372) and we decided not to use it.
I'll try your examples with the new version.

    <WithStack>1) Make your diagram big enough so that zooming to "Page" would require a zoom 
level that is less than the minimum.  
2) Set the zoom level to be the smallest possible from the drop-down combo 
box.  
3) At this point, the zoom out actions will be enabled.
4) However, clicking it won't do anything.

This is because canZoomOut() -- which invokes getMinZoom() -- takes the "Page" 
zoom setting into account.  However, when getPreviousZoomLevel() is invoked, it 
just returns the previous setting from the array of zoom levels, and ignores 
the "Page" zoom setting.
Fixed.  getMinZoom() does not take the "Page" setting into account.  Separated 
primSetZoom() method -- the range check is done in setZoom(), but not in 
primSetZoom() -- out of setZoom().  Whenever one of the "Page" settings is 
selected, primSetZoom() is invoked instead of setZoom().</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Keep entering 1% in the zoom combo box and you will see that the diagram keeps 
shrinking a little by little.  This is because the ZoomManager is interpreting 
that 1% as "Page," and shrinking the diagram accordingly.  And since it's using 
the Figure's preferred size to calculate the zoom level, and because changing 
the zoom level changes its preferred size, when you enter 1% the next time, the 
new minimum zoom is slightly less than earlier.
Set a UI multiplier, and you will see a lot more anomalies for this case.  
Simply choosing "Page" from the drop-down changes the zoom level four times, 
causing flickers on the screeng.
Fixed.  When setting the zoom level to be page, width, or height, the extra 
space to the right/bottom of the editor is not removed.  Hence, at the "Page" 
setting, you can still have both scrollbars.  We have decided that we are going 
to leave it like that.
Changing status to fixed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Native windows apps can set both a small and large system icon for their 
windows (Shells), but SWT (Win32) only allows setting the small 
icon "decorations.setImage(Image)".  The small icon (generally 16x16) is used 
on the window decoration and the large (generally 32x32) is used for the Alt-
Tab task switcher.  Without being able to specify the large icon, the OS is 
forced to scale the small icon producing a ragged looking image (the Eclipse 
icon looks fairly rough in the Alt-Tab window).  Other OSs may have similar 
functionality that this enhancement may benefit, so this is probably not a 
Win32 specific problem.  SWT developers are currently forced to chose 1 size 
Shell icon to work for all platform specific purposes.

I am recommending the following additions to the Decorations class API.  
Included is a potential Win32 implementation.  Implementations of other OSs 
should be fairly similar and trivial.  This includes the addition of a new 
ImageProvider interface which allows the application an opportunity to provide 
the correct size image based on the platform requirements.

    <WithOutStack>Native windows apps can set both a small and large system icon for their 
windows (Shells), but SWT (Win32) only allows setting the small 
icon "decorations.setImage(Image)".  The small icon (generally 16x16) is used 
on the window decoration and the large (generally 32x32) is used for the Alt-
Tab task switcher.  Without being able to specify the large icon, the OS is 
forced to scale the small icon producing a ragged looking image (the Eclipse 
icon looks fairly rough in the Alt-Tab window).  Other OSs may have similar 
functionality that this enhancement may benefit, so this is probably not a 
Win32 specific problem.  SWT developers are currently forced to chose 1 size 
Shell icon to work for all platform specific purposes.

I am recommending the following additions to the Decorations class API.  
Included is a potential Win32 implementation.  Implementations of other OSs 
should be fairly similar and trivial.  This includes the addition of a new 
ImageProvider interface which allows the application an opportunity to provide 
the correct size image based on the platform requirements.

I am trying to change the setUp method in my test suite so that it performs
some standard behaviour and delegates to a new method, uiSetUp.  I have my
own abstract superclass for the tests: UITestCase.  I want to change
existing subclasses (about 35 of them) from overriding setUp to overriding
uiSetUp.
Likewise for tearDown.

For example, the old code is:

public abstract class UITestCase extends TestCase {
  // setUp is not overridden from JUnit's TestCase class

}

public class ConcreteUITestCase extends UITestCase {
   protected void setUp() {
       // do some test-specific setup (most implementations don't currently
call super)
   }
}

The new way should be:

public abstract class UITestCase extends TestCase {
  protected final void setUp() {
     // do some standard setup, common to all tests, which can't be
overridden)
     uiSetUp();
  }

  protected void uiSetUp() {
     // do nothing by default
  }
}

public class ConcreteUITestCase extends UITestCase {
   public void uiSetUp() {
       // do some test-specific setup
   }
}

I tried simply renaming setUp to uiSetUp in UITestCase, but it won't let me
do that without starting at the highest declaration of setUp in TestCase.

Can any of the existing refactorings help with this change?

Thanks,
Nick
Unfortunatelly not. The rename refactoring is semantic preserving. 
So if you rename setup it renames all methods in the hierarchy with 
the same signature and all references to them.

The refactoring you are requesting is something like: "convert method into
template method and create delegate with existing signature". I will open
a feature request.  
We have now rename method and keep delegate. I guess the refactoring could allow the rename of all method in source (and keep the one in binary), if you choose not to rename all references.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Ant will not launch if the classpath for the project is incomplete. An example 
of when this is a problem is when you want to use Ant to generate part of your 
project.

I can reproduce this on a virgin Eclipse 3.0M5 build. However, I have another 
Eclipse 3.0M5 build which started life as a 3.0M2 build and has been upgraded 
with each new milestone drop. The upgraded installation doesn't have this 
problem.

The workaround is to use a command line to drive Ant to "bootstrap" the 
project; not quite as nice.
Robert I am not quite grokking what you are doing...are you running Ant on the 
build.xml that you have auto-generated from the plugin.xml for your project?

What exactly do you mean "Ant will not launch"?
Step by step details would be greatly appreciated.
I have a manually created build.xml for my Java project. This has tasks in it 
which I want to create elements that will go onto my classpath. An example 
would be the task that goes and fetches the correct version of various third-
party JAR files.

If my project is in clean state (e.g. checked out of CVS), these elements don't 
exist yet. I need to run Ant to get them.

If I try to run Ant from within the virgin Eclipse 3.0M5 installation, I get an 
error like this:
  ERROR: Launch: the archive: /&lt;project&gt;/lib/log4j.jar which is referenced by 
the classpath, does not exist


The "upgraded" Eclipse installation doesn't have this behaviour. This may be 
the result of setting an option that doesn't appear in the GUI anymore, but I'm 
not sure.

Once I run Ant from the command-line, the problem goes away (until I run the 
full-clean task which blows them all away again...)

To reproduce:
  * use a vanilla Eclipse 3.0M5 installation.
  * Create a project
  * Create a simple Ant script, with a Hello-World style task.
  * Add a JAR file to the project.
  * Add the Jar file to the project's class path.
  * Run ant script, verify it works.
  * Delete JAR file from filesystem.
  * Refresh project.
  * Verify the Java build error due to the incomplete classpath
  * Run ant script.
  * Note error in the Progess view.

In M5 the default behavior for new launch configurations is to run the build 
in a separate VM. This means that the classpath for the project is resolved 
before the build occurs (I am not sure this is required..needs more 
investigation). 

The workaround for you is to specify that the Ant build occur in the same VM 
as Eclipse (see the Ant JRE tab for your Ant launch configuration) where the 
classpath resolution is not needed. This will give you the same behavior as in 
your "upgraded" Eclipse installation.
Thanks Darin, that workaround does indeed work.

It would be very useful, however, to be able to launch Ant in a separate JVM, 
particuarly if an ANT_HOME outside of Eclipse is being used.
Wow that was quick :-)
I agree that this seems like an unnecessary restriction.
I am looking into as we speak...
The "Ant in a separate VM" launch mimics being a Java application launch.
The AntLaunchDelegate was not setting a ISourceLocator for the launch, so 
JavaRuntime was happily providing the default Java source locator and 
therefore had to resolve the classpath for the project (and hit the missing 
JAR problem). Ant launches do not need the Java source locator.

Fixed in AntLaunchDelegate.


Please verify Luc.
Verified.
Please update the build notes, Darin S.

error like this:
  ERROR: Launch: the archive: /&lt;project&gt;/lib/log4j.jar which is referenced by 
the classpath, does not exist


The "upgraded" Eclipse installation doesn't have this behaviour. This may be 
the result of setting an option that doesn't appear in the GUI anymore, but I'm 
not sure.

Once I run Ant from the command-line, the problem goes away (until I run the 
full-clean task which blows them all away again...)

To reproduce:
  * use a vanilla Eclipse 3.0M5 installation.
  * Create a project
  * Create a simple Ant script, with a Hello-World style task.
  * Add a JAR file to the project.
  * Add the Jar file to the project's class path.
  * Run ant script, verify it works.
  * Delete JAR file from filesystem.
  * Refresh project.
  * Verify the Java build error due to the incomplete classpath
  * Run ant script.
  * Note error in the Progess view.

In M5 the default behavior for new launch configurations is to run the build 
in a separate VM. This means that the classpath for the project is resolved 
before the build occurs (I am not sure this is required..needs more 
investigation). 

The workaround for you is to specify that the Ant build occur in the same VM 
as Eclipse (see the Ant JRE tab for your Ant launch configuration) where the 
classpath resolution is not needed. This will give you the same behavior as in 
your "upgraded" Eclipse installation.
Thanks Darin, that workaround does indeed work.

It would be very useful, however, to be able to launch Ant in a separate JVM, 
particuarly if an ANT_HOME outside of Eclipse is being used.
Wow that was quick :-)
I agree that this seems like an unnecessary restriction.
I am looking into as we speak...
The "Ant in a separate VM" launch mimics being a Java application launch.
The AntLaunchDelegate was not setting a ISourceLocator for the launch, so 
JavaRuntime was happily providing the default Java source locator and 
therefore had to resolve the classpath for the project (and hit the missing 
JAR problem). Ant launches do not need the Java source locator.

Fixed in AntLaunchDelegate.


Please verify Luc.
Verified.
Please update the build notes, Darin S.

    <WithStack>The following statement (where stype is a String):

Causes any refactorings on the menu to simply do nothing. No error or anything. 
Removing the (unnecessary) parens makes refactorings work again.

As a secondary bug, if refactorings are not going to happen for whatever reason, 
there should at least be an error message. (I had thought that my Eclipse setup 
was messed up and causing refactoring to fail, so I reinstalled Eclipse, 
restored settings which I'd been fiddling with, etc... until I finally realized 
that the problem was only with one source file, and not a session-wide problem.)
refactoring is jdt-ui.

John, which compiler compilance settings are you using?
1.4, default compliance settings. All four options in Classfile Generation are 
checked.

There are two issues here:

- if you use the assert feature the compliance level must be set to 1.4 and
  and Generated .class files compatibility and source compatibility must be
  set to 1.4. Disallow identifiers... must be set to Error.

- if you don't set this, the CU will contain an error that method assert isn't
  know. This might some refactoring to fail. However I tested it with 
  I20031203 and most of them worked.

Closing as works for me in 3.0 stream. John please reopen if I am missing 
something.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I ran into this originally in a more elaborate plugin development scenario on 
2.1.1.
However I can reproduce it with 3.0 M5 as well. Here are the steps:
1. Create a simple java project with one class and a main method.
2. Set a breakpoint in the main method.
3. Create a launch configuration of type application 
4. debug and observe how the breakpoint is hit correctly
5. refactor the project's name.
6. Go into the debug debug perspective.
There will be exceptions in the .log file or ErrorLog window.

Logfile containing exceptions

This is from the original situation, repeated twice.
Could not reproduce problem. It looks like the breakpoints view was attempting 
to render a breakpoint that no longer exists. When I try this, the breakpoint 
is removed as expected (when a project is renamed). We intend to improve this 
with refactoring support in 3.0, such that the breakpoint remains.

However, I did remove unecessary logging of exceptions from BreakpointUtils and 
JDIModelPresentation.
Please verify, Darin (S).
I can reproduce the problem on 20031209..the breakpoint is not removed.
With the changes nothing is logged to the Error Log but I am now left with a 
breakpoint that has as a label "&lt;not responding&gt;". Investigating.
Good - that you can reproduce it (and that label is expected in the case of a 
missing type). However, the breakpoint should get deleted.
There resource change listener which leads to the element changed notification 
is for post change. We are only post auto build. So we get told about the Java 
types that have been deleted before the auto build has completed and before we 
have loading the breakpoints for the project that has just opened (and has the 
marker with the old type handle).
The problem is with the project rename. The change notification has changed 
somehow. When you rename a single compilation unit, breakpoints are cleaned up 
fine (i.e. auto-deleted). The same used to happen with project renames. I 
could not find a simple fix for M6.

The side effect is that you have to manually delete the breakpoints yourself 
(from the breakpoints view). Marking as a dup since this will just be replaced 
by refactoring support, rather than a fix (see bug 7552).

Oh - Horror! I read my example again and I have the strong need 
to apologise for my bad english grammar and orthography: 
                    Please excuse me.
Created attachment 7075
Actual result with the new code formatter

Here is the actual result with the new formatter. You can enable it in
Preferences&gt;Java&gt;Work in progress. If you use the latest integration build,
then you can also set the preferences through the code formatter preferences
page.
No word about my problems with the code assistant?
Btw: The new code formater formats
	private final Object o(
		Object oBegin,
		Object oEnd,
		Object oSB //
	) throws Throwable { ...
as 
	/**
	 * openRelativePath()
	 */
	private final Object o(Object oBegin, Object oEnd,
		Object oSB //
	) throws Throwable { ...
and I don't like that (I tried that a few mont ago). Now I hope
that becomes configureable if its new options page are 
available ... . I will wait patient.
What do you expect? You have a line comment in the parameters of your method
declaration.
First of all the code formater is not my (min) issue in this report,
I expect an code assist option
     "Import only toplevel classes"
for the code assist functinality
    "Automatically add import instead of qualified name".

Now to your (main?) issue: My line comments in my source code make the 
old code formater behave more as I like it .... . 
I hope the new code formaters option dialog makes that obsolete in 
the future.
Remark to #5: Now I believe understand your question (sorry I'm late).
              My "argument tower" is not hand made but is
              formated with the old code formater
Hello? Hello echo .. echoo oo oo oo (listen ... silence everywhere!).
Is somebody (other then myself) interested in this report?
Have I made a mistake or something like that?
You better reformulate your problem, as I read this bug report I don't 
understand what's you expectation. Is it a problem with code assit or with the 
formatter? If it is the latter, what are you currently seeing? What would you 
like to see?
This report is a combined bug-report and feature request and it is not 
intended for readers but for rewriters. 
My intension was that somebody copies the source code, deletes the class
AssistMyStyleImpl and rewrittes it as outlined in the comments of class
AssistMyStyleImpl. 
The kind rewriter runs in many problems, each of this problems may become a
bug report of its own, but I have no time to write them.
At the end I suggest a feature for eclispe:

[1] In "Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Editor &gt; Code Assist" add an
 *     flag "Don't import inner classes" or "Import only toplevel classes"

I think this feature is self explanatory. 
If nobody is interested to rewrite my example you may close this report, 
because only people withthe same problems may understand it.
Closing then.
Please enter concise bug reports in the future trying to focus on one problem 
each.</WithStack>

Oh - Horror! I read my example again and I have the strong need 
to apologise for my bad english grammar and orthography: 
                    Please excuse me.
Created attachment 7075
Actual result with the new code formatter

Here is the actual result with the new formatter. You can enable it in
Preferences&gt;Java&gt;Work in progress. If you use the latest integration build,
then you can also set the preferences through the code formatter preferences
page.
No word about my problems with the code assistant?
Btw: The new code formater formats
	private final Object o(
		Object oBegin,
		Object oEnd,
		Object oSB //
	) throws Throwable { ...
as 
	/**
	 * openRelativePath()
	 */
	private final Object o(Object oBegin, Object oEnd,
		Object oSB //
	) throws Throwable { ...
and I don't like that (I tried that a few mont ago). Now I hope
that becomes configureable if its new options page are 
available ... . I will wait patient.
What do you expect? You have a line comment in the parameters of your method
declaration.
First of all the code formater is not my (min) issue in this report,
I expect an code assist option
     "Import only toplevel classes"
for the code assist functinality
    "Automatically add import instead of qualified name".

Now to your (main?) issue: My line comments in my source code make the 
old code formater behave more as I like it .... . 
I hope the new code formaters option dialog makes that obsolete in 
the future.
Remark to #5: Now I believe understand your question (sorry I'm late).
              My "argument tower" is not hand made but is
              formated with the old code formater

    <WithStack>The following solution is used to make the editor readonly or locking it so 
that no one can write in it.

I am using the following method in JavaEditor example that is extending 
CompilationUnitEditor.

public void setEditable(boolean editable) {
   ISourceViewer viewer = getSourceViewer();
   if (viewer != null) {
       viewer.setEditable(editable);
   }
}

this didn't work and then I got another hack from Andrew about getting the 
sourceviewer after the creation of the editor.I do get the viewer throught 
that but I still can't get the seteditable method do any work.I used the 
following way of getting the SourceViewer() .

IWorkbench workbench = PlatformUI.getWorkbench();
                   IWorkbenchWindow window = 
workbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow();
                                     workbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow();
                           IWorkbenchPage page = window.getActivePage();
                              IEditorPart part = page.getActiveEditor();

if (part instanceof CompilationUnitEditor) {
    CompilationUnitEditor editor = (CompilationUnitEditor)part;
  ITextViewer viewer =
(ITextViewer)editor.getAdapter(ITextOperationTarget.class);
}

when I call viewer.setEditable() here after the creation of the editor 
through a button nothing happens.
There are couple of things that I have read about it.
Frist how am I sure if the getActiveEditor does get me the editor I am 
typing on.If I use getSite() the above doesn't let me use it,or gives me a 
NullPointerException.
Secondly everywhere in the archives I have read that everyone is calling 
getSourceViewer().setEditable(); But in my case I can't call that.

I think lately Jared had the same problem of gettiing a Null value when he 
use to call getActiveEditor where I think you reaplied that in 3.0 getSite 
and getPage() should be used.

I am using 2.1 right now as I can't use 3.0 as I have to do a lot of 
changes.

I verified that the methods work as designed. What happens is the following:

the state again to true because it is a file editor and the read-only state

    <WithStack>Hi,

    When I double click Shell title bar to maximize the shell,
and after Shell maximized, if the mouse is over StyleText control,
will cause StyleText selection changed.  

    My env is Windows XP, jdk1.4.2, eclipse 3.0 M5.

Thanks

Created attachment 7072
code snippet to reproduct the bugs

In eclipse IDE, Use mouse double click shell title bar or use "File" -&gt; "Open
External File..." the double click file to open it, also affect.
The second mouse click of the double-click is going into the StyledText and 
changing the selection.  Why would the click not be eaten by the shell, since 
it's what triggers the maximization?

Is this a case of the StyledText seeing a mouse up without seeing a mouse down 
and then doing something strange?  FH to (quickly) investigate.
It is not a mouse up Steve, it is a mouse move.
Not sure how to fix it.

    <WithStack>HTMLTextPresenter is an internal class.
This presenter has intelligent tooltip placement and text shortening.
It can interpret some basic HTML tags like boldface font.
So it makes use to make the class public API so that others do not need to
implement the same functionality again.
Eclipse 3.0 contains a SWT browser widget which allows you to render full 
HTML. So there is no need to make HTMLPresenter API.
Reopening to correctly dipsose.

Ok, second time typing this in because I got an error submitting it the first 
time and Bugzilla told me to hit the Back button and fix it and lost all the 
data on the form when I did (nice). This will be shorter due to my RSI.

Our CVS server is running on an OS X Machine (10.2.6)

When checking out a project from CVS on Windows, it is checked out as a Unix 
project. If you try to perform any CVS actions on the checked out project using 
Tortoise CVS, you are shown an error message that tells you did. I had typed in 
the whole message last time but cannot this time (you cannot copy/paste the 
error message in the dialog -- nice -- they really think of us folk with RSI 
when designing apps). 

Problems due to this: Cannot diff (compare) files in Eclipse. Cannot use 
checked out project with TortoiseCVS.

Seen on WinXP and Windows 2000.
"that tells you did" should be "that tells you this"
Btw, we are using extssh.
Although the problem still appears with open source projects such as Ant and 
Jetspeed, the compare function in Eclipse works with files in those projects, 
leading me to believe that the two things are not related. Those projects, when 
checked out, are also checked out as Unix on Windows. 
Update: The issue is *not* with the built-in extssh -- the same thing happens 
(a Unix checkout is performed on Windows) when using exactly the same ext ssh 
as TortoiseCVS.

When TortoiseCVS is used to checkout the same project, however, it is correctly 
checked out for Windows.
When I check out files on windows, they are checked out in windows format 
(i.e. CRLF linefeeds). I noticed that the meta files that are saved by Eclispe 
use Unix line endings (e.g. CVSROOT/Entries). Perhaps this is a problem for 
Tortoise. Can you verify this (i.e. open the CVS/Entries file in Notepad from 
the Windows exploere and see what the line endings are for Eclipse and 
Tortoise).
Update: The issue with the diff/compares was completely unrelated. We were 
running an unsupported version of CVS (1.10). Upgrading it got rid of that 
issue.

However, the main problem remains.

Hi Michael, I see the problem with the meta files, yes. I manually altered them 
to match a repository checked out in Tortoise and still got the warning from 
Tortoise. 

Apparently, it is only a warning though and you can disable it from 
Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Check not Unix sandbox.

I don't know, however, if this will have any ill effects if used with the meta 
files saved by Eclipse.
So the problem is the CVS/Entries file. Does this prevent Tortoise from 
working or does it just give you a warning? I suspect it's the later.
Ignoe my last question. I added it after your last post but before I saw it. I 
suspect you will not have problems as Eclipse will handle either line ending. 
I suspect Tortoise will as well.
Np, I did the same with your last post :) Tortoise appears to be handling it 
but just in case I think we'll lay off mixing the two whenever possible. Now 
that we have the compare issue solved, we don't really need to use Tortoise 
alongside Eclipse. Good to know that it's assigned to be fixed, though. 
Thanks! :)

    <WithStack>These are very useful classes.
They are good for use in wizards.
From my point of view, there is no alternative for these APIs.
Especially ResourceTreeAndListGroup is used by Eclipse in the following Export
Wizards: file, jar, JavaDoc, and zip.
The ContainerCheckedTreeViewer class provides the standard behavior of placing 
a grayed checkbox on a parent container which has some but not all of its 
children checked and a solid check on a container that has all its children 
checked. This is the behavior we want in wizards for exporting resources to a 
remote server (FTP or WebDAV). Unfortunately, the class is internal. Is there 
API to give this checking behavior that I missed? If not and this is a 
behavior that we want to advocate, could we consider making the class API (and 
save me from copying it;-)?
*** Bug 50357 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Not planned for 3.0
Reopening now that 3.0 has shipped
any news on this?
I have promoted ContainerCheckedTreeViewer to API in org.eclipse.ui.dialogs. I
am not going to promote ResourceTreeAndListGroup at this time as no one uses it
and it could do with some work. If you still want me to promote
ResourceTreeAndListGroup please log a seperate bug report as we need to track
the completed work in this one.

Adding Dejan as it looks like update copies this.

I will delete this once Team and JDT have update thier references.

Fixed in build &gt;20050315
I have released the changes to Team and RelEng to HEAD. Did you inform JDT of 
the change directly (I don't see them on the CC list)?
Adding Wassim - I am sure PDE has at least one checkbox tree that exhibits 
this behaviour.
Verified in 20050330

Also verified that there are no more internal references.

I am developping for Eclipse 2.1 using a self-hosting 2.1 workspace on top of 
Eclipse SDK 3.0. I wanted to launch Eclipse 2.1 as a runtime workbench so as to 
run some test suites (due to bug 48125); and thus remembered I needed to import 
an extra plug-in: org.eclipse.pde.junit.

In order to do so, I did the following:
- open the file import plug-in wizard
- configured the target platform there to point at a 2.1.2 SDK install
- select import as binary
- press NEXT
- in the list of available plug-ins, org.eclipse.pde.junit isn't available
(ok as it is not part of the 2.1 delivery)
- hit BACK, keep import wizard up,
- outside Eclipse, expand the missing plug-in into the 2.1.2 install
- back inside Eclipse, import wizard is still up, click on target platform 
button
- in target platform wizard, press RELOAD
- observe that org.eclipse.pde.junit is listed, press OK

    <WithStack>Hi!

I can Copy (context menu) an element from navigator, e.g. a class,
but can change to Package explorer and Paste it there!
But I can go back to navigator and paste it still there.
Seems not to be bug, but a missing feature!?

    <WithStack>I think the default for "before prefix operators" should be not checked, i.e. no

It should be handled similar to unary operators which do not have a space before
either.
Fix on my side.
Silvio, do you need to fix anything in the UI?

Silvio,

here an idea how to fix this. We could remember the size of the dialog. When 
we first open it we will use and initial size. After that we use the 
remembered one. We do that with refactorings and other dialogs as well.
Dirk, I have a fix here which does correct resizing and fixes the transparent
flickering. 

Do you think remembering the size is necessary?
Resizing is fixed in HEAD.
The dialog should "remember" its size and location.

    <WithStack>Overview/Steps to reproduce :
Embed .xls file as OLE document in the IEditorPart. If that editor is opened,
the workbench menus are replaced by the .xls menus {Edit, View, Insert, Format,
Tools, Data, Help}. Even if the active editor is changed to something else, the
original workbench menus do not show up. 

The only way to get back the workbench menus is to close the editor that has OLE
document. 


Expected behavior :
When the active editor is say Java Editor, the workbench should show the
original set of menus, and not the OLE document specific menus. When the active
editor is the one embedding the OLE doc, the document specific menus should be
shown.


Additional Information :

VI, not sure if this is OLE or UI.

'File' menu and nothing else on the menu bar.

Are you really using 2.1.1?  If so, please retry with 2.1.2 - some fixes where 
made for hangs in Ole in 2.1.2 which may be causing your problem
Sorry for the confusion, I am indeed using 2.1.1 with Excel 2002 SP-1, the
modified problem statement is explained again here (Note : The following
behavior is same in SWT 2.1.2 as well) :

Case 1:
If I open a .csv (comma separated format) file in the Editor along with a text
editor, we can reproduce the problem I have stated in the original bug report.

Case 2: 
If I open a .xls file in the Editor along with a text editor, then the menus
function properly, though the display process has some flicker.

Case 3: (This is a new addition)
If I open a .xls, a .csv and a text file, then
   (a)  .xls editor has its own Excel specific and Platform menus (appropriate)
   (b)  .csv and text editors both have the menus pertaining to text editor.
and (c)  the .csv editor becomes uneditable sometimes showing row and column
headers and sometimes not.


How do you open the .csv file - are you writing your own editor or embedding 
another Ole object?

The problem is that you must be very careful about the order in which things 
become activated.

See:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17480

When an Ole editor is activated or deactivated it changes the menu shown.  
Therefore, if you are switching between two Ole editors you must deactivate 
the one that you are leaving before activating the one you are going to.  The 
same is true when going between an Ole editor and a non-Ole editor.  You need 
to deactivate the Ole Editor before you activate the text editor.  The Eclipse 
Text editor gets it right and the Eclipse OleEditor gets it right - use those 
as your examples.


Got it, thx!

I was writing my own editor embedding OleFrame and expected OleFrame to take
care of menus. A gross blunder on my part :(!! 

But looks like .csv files can be opened in Excel by double clicking in
WindowsExplorer, but do not get opened in OleEditor by doubleclicking in
ResourceNavigator. 

I can live with that for now... or can open a bug report if you suggest.
Created attachment 7122
screenshot of creating file association

In Window -&gt; Preferences update you file associations to map *.csv to Excel -
see attached screen shot.

After you add *.csv to the top area, click on "Add" in the bototm area to
create the association with Excel.
Closing this bug report since menu is behaving as expected.</WithStack>

I was writing my own editor embedding OleFrame and expected OleFrame to take
care of menus. A gross blunder on my part :(!! 

But looks like .csv files can be opened in Excel by double clicking in
WindowsExplorer, but do not get opened in OleEditor by doubleclicking in
ResourceNavigator. 

I can live with that for now... or can open a bug report if you suggest.
Created attachment 7122
screenshot of creating file association

In Window -&gt; Preferences update you file associations to map *.csv to Excel -
see attached screen shot.

After you add *.csv to the top area, click on "Add" in the bototm area to
create the association with Excel.
Closing this bug report since menu is behaving as expected.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder does not have a label
Created attachment 7074
no label

Version: 3.0.0
Build id: 200312030800
Moving to JDT/Debug for further investigation. I observed this behavior as 
well, but we do define a label in our plugin.xml/plugin.properties.

Any clue ?
Moving to platform ant (external tools support)
I am not able to reproduce the problem.
Is this for all of your projects?
Is the label always missing?
Any particular test case?
Thanks.
I see the same problem.
In the builders properties page of org.eclipse.ant.core, only 'Built Ant Support
JAR' has a label, the other 3 builders have no label.

I see it too (or rather, do not see labels).
OK...I am missing labels in my host but not in my runtime-workbench target?
Something strange afoot...
Pascal the labels that are missing are generated using the code in 
BuilderPropertyPage.getBuildName(String builderID):
----
IExtension extension = Platform.getPluginRegistry().getExtension
(ResourcesPlugin.PI_RESOURCES, ResourcesPlugin.PT_BUILDERS, builderID);

String builderName;
if (extension != null) {
	builderName = extension.getLabel();
} else {
	builderName = MessageFormat.format(ExternalToolsUIMessages.getString
("BuilderPropertyPage.missingBuilder"), new Object[] { builderID }); //$NON-
NLS-1$
}
return builderName;
---------

It would appear that in the host workspace, extension.getLabel() is returning 
an empty string, whereas in a PDE runtime-workbench the correct label of the 
extension is returned. Is this a known issue?
This sounds like a runtime issue...
Moving to equinox-general and renaming.

There were several problems. First some fields were not written by the cache 
writer and second some translation were not saved.

This is all fixed and released in HEAD.

    <WithStack>Often plugins need to maintain state at plugin level or per project. Projects 
allow to save project properties - but it's only possible to save strings 
there. Because I think that saving state is a common task for most plugins, I'd 
appreciate if there's a possibility to save objects for a plugin/project 
without having to implement the persistence mechanism. E.g. the platform could 
support the XML (de-)serialization of objects.
Plugins can obtain a per-project private metadata area with
IProject.getPluginWorkingLocation. 
Yes, I know, but I think it would be useful to have a framework service for 
persisting objects instead of implementing a persistence service in every 
plugin.
JDK 1.4 already includes JAXP APIs for (de)serialization of XML.  I'm going to
mark this as a dup of the user settings plan item, which may include API for
storing richer per-project settings.

Version: 3.0.0
Build id: 200311211210

"Project refresh" and "Package refresh" does not see changes in source files 
made outside the Eclipse.

Exact way to reproduce bug:
- Create empty Java Project
- Create new class "Test" with "main" method
- Create new class "MyClass" (note that both files are now open)
- Add inside "main":
    MyClass object = new MyClass("test");
- Obvious error appears
- Close file "MyClass.java"
- Open file "MyClass.java" in external editor (e.g. Notepad)
- Add new constructor:
    MyClass(String s) {
    }
- Save the file
- Do the "Project Refresh"
- Package tree may be updated correctly, but...
- ... error in "Test.java" is still red-underlined

Probably linked issue:
Sometimes after deleting a class from project (and simultaneously from disk!), 
it still appears in the package tree.


Such behaviour is unique to Eclipse 3.0M5 (it was NOT in 3.0M4)


I work with external UML tool to generate skeleton code for classes. So I need 
to update some classes outside the Eclipse, or possibly add some new classes. 
While everything was fine in Eclipse 3.0M4, something is broken in 3.0M5.
I tested the above scenario in I20031216 (M6 candidate) and wasn't able to 
reproduce. Please not that temporary errors only go away in the editor after 
giving focus to the editor.

Can you please retest it again using M6 and reopen if the problem still exists?</WithStack>

- launch a target
- while it's still getting off the ground, click Terminate
- the progress indicator shows a red box and the progress view indicates an

Simply canceling an operation should not be an error condition.
I was able to reproduce. I noticed the following in the error log when I did

    <WithStack>From Sheldon:

Chris, fyi, I tried again last night on my home PC (yet another machine)  
which is running RH9 and I still get the same problems using the 12-02 
integration driver. I completely uninstalled Mozilla 1.4 packages and 
installed the three RPMS without any dependency problems or complaints, could 
serve from Mozilla 1.5, had the directories created and the gre.conf file 
created. Still I got the "no more handles" exception, identical to what I sent 
you previously running on RH8.
Hi Sheldon,
A few questions: 
which build of SWT are you using?
Are you using the GTK SWT distribution?
Can you confirm a standalone (not a plugin) SWT application fail in the same 
way for you (e.g. 
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-
home/snippits/snippet136.txt


I'm experiencing the same problem trying to instantiate a Browser component 
running on Debian (Sid). The code works fine on Win XP.

The SWT exception is thrown in the ctor of org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser. 
Here's the code that causes the error:

		try {
			Library.loadLibrary ("swt-mozilla"); //$NON-NLS-1$
		} catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
			dispose();
			SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_NO_HANDLES); // &lt;- this happens
		}

Needles to say that the error constant should be a different one. I still have 
no idea what actually causes the error.

I've got Mozilla 1.5 installed. The shared object set-mozilla is in my path 
exactly like the other swt shared objects.

I noticed that the GRE config file was not part of my installation so I made my 
own:

thofmann@knippix:~$ cat /etc/gre
gre.conf       grep-dctrl.rc
thofmann@knippix:~$ cat /etc/gre.conf
1.5
GRE_PATH=/usr/lib/mozilla

I don't think this is the problem though. I'm using the following parameters to 
start my app:

-Djava.library.path="/opt/eclipse 
3/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk_3.0.0/os/linux/x86/:/usr/lib/mozilla/"

The call to Library.loadLibrary tries to load a lib called swt-mozilla-gtk-
3034, which is fine since I'm working with the Milestone 6 build.

		String newName = name + "-" + platform + "-" + version; //$NON-
NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$
		System.loadLibrary (newName);

Now this call fails. This is what my SOs look like:

thofmann@knippix:~$ ll "/opt/eclipse 
3/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk_3.0.0/os/linux/x86"

I'm not sure if trying to load swt-mozilla-gtk-3034 should actually load swt-
mozilla-gtk-3034.so. Is this correct? Is lib prefixed and .so suffixed by the 
VM?

I found out that the call to Library.loadLibrary tries to load a different lib 
in case the first System.loadLibrary call fails. That's why the original (the 
first one) exception is not thrown to the caller.

	try {
		String newName = name + "-" + platform + "-" + version; //$NON-
NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$
		System.loadLibrary (newName);
		return;
	} catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e1) {		
		try {
			String newName = name + "-" + platform; //$NON-NLS-1$
			System.loadLibrary (newName);
			return;
		} catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e2) {
			throw e1;
		}
	}

A little test case sheds some light on the problem:

public class BrowserLoadingTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			System.loadLibrary("swt-mozilla-gtk-3034");
		} catch(UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
			System.out.println("Caught: " + e);
		}
	}
}

Setting the same lib path again executing this test gives me:

Caught: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /opt/eclipse 
3/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk_3.0.0/os/linux/x86/libswt-mozilla-gtk-3034.so: 
libxpcom.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory^

So the answer to my question above about prefixing with "lib" seems to be that 
this is how it must be.


So what about libxpcom.so?

In the spec for IExecutableExtension, it describes two ways in which an 
extension with a class attribute can pass arguments to the new instance.
One of the ways is to append an argument string to the class name, using ':' as 
as separator.  

I'm in the process of changing one of our tests to use this mechanism.
We were previously using a separate "menuType" attribute which was not in the 
schema, so this was getting reported as a compile-time error (we run with all 
the PDE compiler checks set to Error).

The extension in question previously looked like:
      &lt;view
            name="Action Filter Test View 1"
            menuType="static"    
            icon="icons\view.gif"
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IActionFilterTest1"&gt;
      &lt;/view&gt;

It now looks like:
      &lt;view
            name="Action Filter Test View 1"
            icon="icons\view.gif"
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView:-staticMenu"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IActionFilterTest1"&gt;
      &lt;/view&gt;

PDE currently gives an error for this case:
  Referenced class 'org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView:-staticMenu' in 
attribute 'class' cannot be found.

PDE should strip off any arguments before trying to resolve the class.

IExecutableExtension also describes another way of specifying arguments.
You can convert the class-bearing attribute to a separate sub-element of the 
same name, with sub-sub-elements for arguments.  For example, I could specify 
something like:

      &lt;view
            name="Action Filter Test View 1"
            icon="icons\view.gif"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IActionFilterTest1"&gt;
        &lt;class
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView"
            &lt;parameter name="menuType" value="static"&gt;
        &lt;/class&gt;
      &lt;/view&gt;

Note that the element name is whatever the class-bearing attribute name was.  
In this case it happens to be "class", but it could have been something else, 
e.g. "run".

PDE should handle this case as well, without requiring that the schema for each 
extension point declares a subelement corresponding to the class-bearing 
attribute.
I had a couple of syntax errors in the last example above.  It should have been:

      &lt;view
            name="Action Filter Test View 1"
            icon="icons\view.gif"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IActionFilterTest1"&gt;
        &lt;class
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView"&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="menuType" value="static"/&gt;
        &lt;/class&gt;
      &lt;/view&gt;

This currently generates several PDE errors complaining about missing a 
required attribute, and unknown &lt;class&gt; and &lt;parameter&gt; subelements.

Fixed.

      &lt;/view&gt;

It now looks like:
      &lt;view
            name="Action Filter Test View 1"
            icon="icons\view.gif"
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView:-staticMenu"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IActionFilterTest1"&gt;
      &lt;/view&gt;

PDE currently gives an error for this case:
  Referenced class 'org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView:-staticMenu' in 
attribute 'class' cannot be found.

PDE should strip off any arguments before trying to resolve the class.

IExecutableExtension also describes another way of specifying arguments.
You can convert the class-bearing attribute to a separate sub-element of the 
same name, with sub-sub-elements for arguments.  For example, I could specify 
something like:

      &lt;view
            name="Action Filter Test View 1"
            icon="icons\view.gif"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IActionFilterTest1"&gt;
        &lt;class
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView"
            &lt;parameter name="menuType" value="static"&gt;
        &lt;/class&gt;
      &lt;/view&gt;

Note that the element name is whatever the class-bearing attribute name was.  
In this case it happens to be "class", but it could have been something else, 
e.g. "run".

PDE should handle this case as well, without requiring that the schema for each 
extension point declares a subelement corresponding to the class-bearing 
attribute.
I had a couple of syntax errors in the last example above.  It should have been:

      &lt;view
            name="Action Filter Test View 1"
            icon="icons\view.gif"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IActionFilterTest1"&gt;
        &lt;class
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.ListView"&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="menuType" value="static"/&gt;
        &lt;/class&gt;
      &lt;/view&gt;

This currently generates several PDE errors complaining about missing a 
required attribute, and unknown &lt;class&gt; and &lt;parameter&gt; subelements.

Fixed.

    <WithStack>When authoring many of our various *.xml files a content developer/configurer 
needs to provide plugin-ids and class names.  An example of this is hooking in 
actions to a cheat sheet.

However, once you have found a class that performs your desired action, there 
is no easy way to figure out what plug-in that class lives in.  This is 
particularly true for binary projects.

This makes doing relativly easy user level things, like creating a cheat 
sheet, very, very difficult.

I believe there is a big need for tooling to help a user do this.

    <WithStack>I was browsing some classes that have no source available.  The message under 
the Source not found heading in the Class File Editor is entirely unhelpful in 
finding a soltion to the problem.

"The JAR of this classfile belongs to the container "Required plug-in

configuration page (For example for JRE's go to Installed JRE's page in the

The example does not help.  If what is a JRE?  How is the JRE's configuration 
page going to help me.  what is the JRE configuration page.

For that matter.  What jar is this file in?
To different things here: first the naming of the PDE class path container 
should be improved. The name "Required Plug-in entries" is indeed not very 
helpful. Created new bug 48314 for PDE.

For the help message: since the class file editor doesn't know about specific 
class path container it can only present a generic error message or can 
delegate the creation of the message to the class path container itself. 

But we could improve the example wording to: "For example, if the class path 
container is a JRE System Library container go to Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-
&gt;Install JREs"

Asking JDT/Text for coments.
Of course the delegating isn't implemented yet ;-).
The message has been improved and there is now a button that directly allows to set the source.</WithStack>

Would you have a test case to reproduce?
No, sorry - I only got the error message once.  I was doing alot of 
cutting/pasting with the kind of code snippet below.  I may have gotten my 
curly brackets out of sync - I don't remember.  It just happened once, but it 
gave me a scary message asking me if I wanted to exit due to the possibility of 
the workspace crashing.

     item = new MenuItem (topMenu, SWT.PUSH);
     item.setText ("drawPolygon"); 
     item.addListener (SWT.Selection, new Listener () {
          public void handleEvent (Event e) {
               int[] values = (int[])e.widget.getData();
               createGC();
               gc.drawPolygon(new int[] {10,10, 30,30, 10,50});
               disposeGC();
          }
     });

I can not reproduce the problem (with build 20031121 and 20031211).

Could you give the current compilation unit where the problem occured ?
What kind of action did you perform ? (compilation, completion, open on 
selection, ...)
Please reopen once more information is available
Closing as never reproduced in a long time

Sometimes the hints doens't go away. While i'm writing this I have a Close hint

This is fixed in the 3.0 stream.

    <WithStack>While I was commiting a project I wanted to delete another project which was 
not related with the commit. However I had the windows showing that my 
workspace was lock.
It seems to me that the granularity of the lock is too coarse. Maybe it is the 
lock on delete, but I just wanted to make sure that you knew about it too.
Commit in the sync view uses project level locking but commit run via the 
context menu in other views uses workspace locking. We haven't converted all 
of our operations to project locks. This was somewhat intentional. This way we 
can test the UI responsiveness and backwards compatibility. The fact that you 
got a dialog was good.

Changing the title as a reminder that we may want to convert other operations 
too.
Michael, I think this is fixed?
No. Team&gt;Commit and Team&gt;Update still lock the entire workspace. Will address 
in M9.
This was fixed already.</WithStack>

This problem was uncovered by bug 47377.

We had code like so to configure the toolbar in the console view:
protected void configureToolBar(IToolBarManager mgr) {
  mgr.add(new Separator(IConsoleConstants.LAUNCH_GROUP));
  mgr.add(new Separator(IConsoleConstants.OUTPUT_GROUP));
  mgr.add(fPinAction);
  mgr.add(fDisplayConsoleAction);
}

The trouble is that if you add anything to OUTPUT_GROUP, it will actually appear 
after the fPinAction and fDisplayConsoleAction. This behavior comes from 
ContributionManager#addToGroup(groupName, item, append).

This method appends items to the end of a group by looking through the toolbar 
for the group separator. Then it continues iterating until it hits the next 
group separator or the end of the toolbar. In our case, though, we've got two 
items after the group separator that aren't in the group (the two actions that 
are there by default). The code is just looking for the start of the next group, 
so it ends up including these two actions as part of the OUTPUT_GROUP.

From the looks of the ContributionManager code, fixing this would require the 
manager to store more state than it currently does. As it iterates over the 
items after the start of a group, it has no way of knowing when it gets to items 
that aren't in the group (there's no state stored to remember which group an 
item is in).
doug, i think kosta has been doing some work in toolbars recently. (i couldn't 
find a bugzilla use name for him to cc: him though)
I'm adding Kosta to the cc list, however this is a general JFace contribution 
manager issue, not specific to coolbar managers or menu managers.

The grouping mechanism is currently very simplistic.
Recommend adding another group marker before fPinAction.
The way this is handled in workbench code is to add a second separator 
(SEPARATOR_NAME + "-end").  This works. 
 
I believe this bug is a "would be nice" to fix problem.  Correct me if I'm 
wrong.  Lowering to priority 4 ....

Image showing layout problem
Luc if you could spare some time could you take a look at this one and see if 
anything jumps out at...now that you are the SWT layout master :-)
Can't reproduce on Linux-GTK. Darin, do you still get this problem?
Gotta like bugs that fix themselves if we wait long enough :-)</WithStack>

It's a strange use case, but could indicate a problem that's reachable by a 
more conventional path:

- on the Keys preference page:
  -&gt; set Active Configuration to Standard (3.0) - NEW!
  -&gt; select "Help Me With..." on the Advanced Tab, OK
- open a java editor
- put the caret at the end of the last line (this is probably not relevant)
- hold Ctrl+E for &gt; 5 seconds; during this time the help will open up and then 
quickly go away repeatedly
- let go of CTRL+E; if when you do so there isn't a help window popped up then 
no problem happens.  But if there is a help window open at the time then you'll 
get the next attached exception.

trace
doug, this stack trace is in WorkbenchKeyboard..
It is an outside case.  It happens in the shell deactivation listener.  It is 
assumes that the shell still exists, and tries to close it.  However, it is 
possible for the shell to be removed by other events.  I've added a test for 
null before calling close.

Core dump

This is a core dump caused by a segmentation fault in
"org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE".  I get this reliably
while holding "Ctrl+E" with the new key configuration.
The reason from the problem is new, but the triggering steps are the same. 
Since I can't verify this bug until the new problem is fixed, I'm re-opening
this bug....
... and re-assigning to SWT....

I'm not sure that this is a stop ship for M6, but I'm not sure of the scope of
the problem.  Someone should probably look at this before ok'ing the M6 build.

I'm cleaning up some old bugs.

As far as I can tell, these crashes in GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE() are occuring because
key assist dialogs were being leaked.  Version 1.22 fixed one leak and worked
around this problem, but a dialog was still being leaked in
openMultiKeyAssistShell().

As this is no longer a problem in the current version of the code, I am closing
this as WORKSFORME.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When using a TreeViewer in an RCP application, the TreeViewer's Tree gets its
releaseWidget() method called several times, resulting in a flurry of NPEs. The
releaseWidget method ought to check the "items" property for null condition.

There is still a bug somewhere, but this isn't it. The root cause was a NPE 
being thrown by the TreeViewer's model during an invocation of setInput(null). 
Unfortunately, there was no way to tell from the stack traces that this was the 
case.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>When using a TreeViewer in an RCP application, the TreeViewer's Tree gets its
releaseWidget() method called several times, resulting in a flurry of NPEs. The
releaseWidget method ought to check the "items" property for null condition.

There is still a bug somewhere, but this isn't it. The root cause was a NPE 
being thrown by the TreeViewer's model during an invocation of setInput(null). 
Unfortunately, there was no way to tell from the stack traces that this was the 
case.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>The New JUnit Test Case dialog box appears to cut off the widgets after the tearDown() checkbox.
The second time I brought up the dialog, it was drawn correctly
Seems like a duplicate of bug 51009

    <WithStack>In the Package Explorer and related perspectives it should be possible to
specify preferences for file types that should be visible or hidden. Examples
are: (for Java) *.class, (for Python) *.pyc, *.py~ and others, like *.sh or
*.exe. These files should be specified in the preferences and there should be an
option in the Package explorer to see all files or only those (not) listed in

way of doing this is to try to do a code complete on the proposed element. If 
any hits come back, it is valid. 

BG
This is done as well as possible for now using the parser keywords utility. 
But once we get some form of DOM, we'll be able to figure out what's commented 
out or not so I'll leave this as an enhancemement request.
On linux, I try to hyperlink to std when I have #include &lt;iostream&gt;. clocale 
opens up instead of iostream as expected. Would this be fixed with DOM as well?
I moved my comment to a more appropriate defect, 64181.

    <WithStack>Using 200312030800, the key binding Ctrl +  C doesn't work anymore in the
console using the default key bindings. I have to use the popup menu with the mouse.
This seems to be a general problem with this build.

Previous to this build (tested in M4) I could Ctrl-C with a resource selected 
in the package explorer and the Ctrl-V to generate a copy of this resource.

CTRL-C does not work in any view anymore. I tried:

Debug view
variables view
package explorer
console

The edit menu and context menu action works, but the shortcut does not. Paste 
and Cut seem to work though. Moving to workbench for comment -does not appear 
to be a debug issue.
CTRL-C only seems to work in editors.
I believe this is a duplicate of Bug 48024.  Re-open if I'm wrong.

Bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=45506 warrants changing the
Edit_Detail_Formatter to Open_Detail_Formatter, so the Edit action label will
get fixed in that bug fix.

Proposed fix is trivial

This patch updates the text label of the Change Variable Value debug action. It
adds "..." on the end of the existing string value.
Edit Detail Formatter was updated previously.
Change Variable Value was addressed by the attached patch.

In the Variables View within Debug Perspective, select a variable and right
click on the selected variable. Observer that two actions do not have elipses
[...] in their labels that should because they bring up dialogue windows. They
are "Change Variable Value" and "Edit Detail Formatter".

    <WithStack>When a bundle is accessed through the registry API and has already been 
activated, the plugin descriptor returned does not contain the reference to 
the "plugin object". 

The main area where this is exposed is for example in the preference API where 
the exporter run through all the active plugins and ask them to save their 
preferences.

The solution needs to be consistent whatever the entry points being used by the 
user.

The various entry points are:
  - PluginRegistry.getDescriptor()
  - PluginDescriptor.getPlugin()
  - Platform.getPlugin()
  - MyPlugin.getDefault()
A fix has been checked in HEAD.

It consists in automatically registering the bundles that uses Plugin as a 
superclass of their activator and returning an instance of the default plugin 
for all the other bundles.

The issues left over are:
- if the start of the bundle fails, a bogus plugin object is still registered 
in the registry.
- in the default plugin case, the preferences and log values returned needs to 
be aligned with the 3.0 story.
can this be closed?

    <WithStack>When you type class (inside a class) and '.', code completions shows all the
methods of the current class.which are sintaticaly wrong.
Code completion is computed by JDT/Core.
Can you please provide: build number, and exact steps to reproduce ?
I can reproduce this behavior with the following test case
public class A {
  void foo() {
    class.&lt;cursor&gt;
  }
}

In this completion 'class.' is ignored because it is syntaxicaly wrong at this 
location. So the completion engine considered source as
public class A {
  void foo() {
    &lt;cursor&gt;
  }
}
The result is the same with code like
public class A {
  void foo() {
    for.&lt;cursor&gt;
    #.&lt;cursor&gt;
    =.&lt;cursor&gt;
    =&lt;cursor&gt;
  }
}

Currently this behavior is considered as correct. Perhaps it can be improved.
What kind of behavior do you expect with this test case ?
that's ok, I didn't tested with other characters. I thought eclipse couldn't 
show completions for wrong statements.
Thanks for your attention

    <WithStack>I'm using GTK.
if you select any element in any view and click with the right mouse button, the
selected element appears as it's not selecting, returning to normal after the
action.
This is being done by the platform, which visually hides the selection in 
widgets like Tree whenever focus is moved elsewhere (in this case the popup 
menu).  This also happens in Eclipse if you click on another view.  This 
general behaviour can be seen in other native apps like gtk-demo, and I dislike 
it very much, but cannot change it.

There's probably a request in gnome's bugzilla to change this behaviour.  If 
you find one then let me know and I'll vote for it &lt;g&gt;.

But it's new for me, I don't remember this behaviour in previous versions of 
GTK...
When you say "previous versions of gtk", do you mean previous builds of Eclipse-
for-gtk, or have you recently upgraded the gtk libraries on your computer?

If you mean that you have seen this since upgrading your gtk libraries then 
yes, we have seen this change at the gtk level.  If I use gtk 2.0.6 then the 
selections are not hidden, but if I use gtk 2.2.1 then the selections are 
hidden.

Closing since it's a gtk thing.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I'm running Eclipse 3.0 milestone 5 with Sun JDK 1.4.2

I changed a Java class into an interface by hand and renamed it by hand, which 
triggers the error log message: "An internal error occurred during Java AST 
Creation" and the progress message: "ERROR: Java AST Creation: An internal 
error occurred during Java AST Creation".

Once this error is triggered, any attempt to click on the Java editor with the 
changed file triggers another error and defocuses the editor, making the file 
effectively uneditable.  A workaround solution is to copy text (copy/select 
still works), delete the file, and then recreate the file from scratch.

I tried to pinpoint the steps to reproduce this problem, and it appears to be 
the following steps:

1.  create an empty Java class in some package

2.  in the Java editor, change "class" to "interface" by hand and
    rename the name of the class by hand (e.g. add an "I" in front of the name)

3.  JDT immediately shows a red mark and a code-assist suggesting to 
    recompile the compilation unit w/ the new name, or to revert to the old 
    name.  Choose to recompile/refactor w/ the new name.

4.  the Package Explorer and editor updates w/ the new name, and the 
    "Java AST creation" error appears.  The editor loses focus, any attempt

Close as duplicate of bug 47396.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 47396 ***
Verified that this does not happen with build I200312160010.

But, even strictly following described scenario, I didn't succeed to reproduce 
either with 3.0 M5 or 2.1.2 build!?

One question about scenario is: are you sure that code-assist provide 
recompile/refactor actions?
I've used Quick-fix "Rename compilation unit to 'IX.java'" and refactoring in 
package explorer and both actions works without any AST error message.


Apologies - you're correct, I was using Quick-fix ("Rename compilation unit 
to 'IX.java'"), not code-assist.  

Also, for some reason I'm no longer able to reproduce the error either.  
Beyond installing Java Spider on my copy of 3.0 M5, there hasn't been any 
changes to my Eclipse setup.

It's probably best then to close this bug and not worry about it, since it 
appeared to be pretty spurious, and M6 will probably not encounter this 
problem anyhow.  Thanks for looking into this.</WithStack>

Here is a patch to improve the Source Folder Dialog with these things:
- Hides closed projects by default
- Adds a checkbox to control whether to hide or to show closed projects
- Add the ability to open a closed project by double-clicking on it

I hope this covers all your needs :-)

Sorry, I'm a bit tired. Here is another update.
The changes:
- replaced TreeSelection with IStructuredSelection to generalize the selection
Thanks for the patch.
Assigning a 3.3 milestone so that this patch gets reviewed for 3.3
sigh...reassigning for 3.4. I'm only marking a few bugs 3.4 at this time and will get fixes in before triaging the other unmarked bugs.  That way it won't be delayed again.
This is actually a debug dialog change, so moving to debug.  Sorry it sat in platform UI for so long.  ;-(

The patch extends the functionality of the dialog to include a toggle that lets you decide if closed projects should be presented.

A simpler approach would be to disable the apply button when a closed project is selected.  This was approach platform UI took in bug #82541 for the SaveAsDialog.
fixed in HEAD

I did not apply the patch because we do not want to allow the workspace to be altered via the launch dialog (or child dialogs thereof). Since the projects cannot be opened, there is no need for an option to show closed projects because you can't do anything with them either way.

I did however add a simple viewer filter to not show closed projects.

bug report and move it across if you agree...
Let's leave them in bugzilla for now.  But you're right--at some point soon we 
need to decide whether we and the users are better of with one bug db, or with 
seperate dbs for the JBuilder and NetBeans projects.

Mik, shouldn't this bug be raised against the JBuilder AspectJ project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/
aspectj4jbuildr/)? There's nothing we can do in the Aspectj source tree to fix it here.... Let's close this 
bug report and move it across if you agree...
Let's leave them in bugzilla for now.  But you're right--at some point soon we 
need to decide whether we and the users are better of with one bug db, or with 
seperate dbs for the JBuilder and NetBeans projects.  
Moved from: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?

Fix released as part of AspectJ 1.2.1
More precisely, the status of this bug is "moved to sourceforge" and 
not "fixed".</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>as reported in Bug 45956#c5 , I have 16 bugs from an uninstalled plugin, I don't
know how to get rid off.

Worse even, dozens of new Java errors are no longer added to the task list as
they did before - going to add a screenshot next!
Created attachment 7080
screenshot

using Version: 2.1.2
Build id: 200311030802
Is autobuild turned on?  Do you have any filtering turned on in the tasks list?
Is it reproducible?
finally I solved the problem.
easystruts copied the jars in a directory on its own.
When removing plugin manually (a systematic way to remove a plugin would be
great Bug 47959), I removed that directory as well.
What I didn't realize that the plugin also had added all these jars a second
time to the project's java build path.
Due to that, the project wouldn't rebuild anymore and thus the Java errors were
no longer shown.
So, once I realized that every jar was in the build path with two different
paths and removed the outdated entries, it compiled again and the java errors
were visible again.

====&gt; This experience is one more reason to have a plugin uninstall that
automatically removes all its traces - including jars added to the build path
that are no longer needed.
Closing as invalid.</WithStack>
