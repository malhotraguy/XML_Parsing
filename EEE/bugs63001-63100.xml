Possibly important: I saw this on two of our win98 test machines that have not 
been used in a long time, but I did not see this on my everyday win2000 
machine.  Perhaps it only happens if the known_hosts file is not initially 
found?

Steps:
- open a CVS Repositories view
- create a new repository location: extssh connection to 
dev.eclipse.org /home/eclipse, with your username and password, check the Save 
Password box, Finish
- I get the following consecutive dialogs:

#1: The authenticity of host 'dev.eclipse.org' can't be established...Are you 
sure you want to continue connecting? [yes]
#2: c:\windows\ssh\known_hosts does not exist...create it? [yes]
#3: The parent directory c:\windows\ssh does not exist...create it? [yes, but 
seems redundant with #2?]
#4: c:\windows\ssh has been successfully created.  Please check its access 
permission. [ok]
#5: Error validating location: "Authentication error: 
com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Session.connect: java.net.SocketException: 
Connection reset by peer: socket write error".  Keep location anyway? [no]

So the connection is not successfully created as indicated by #5.  But pressing 
Finish again in the wizard does create it once I re-enter my password in the 
subsequent prompter.
I can't duplicate, but there is a problem in that before the location exists the
password isn't cached in the location yet and when ssh2 tried to authenticate it
has to prompt again.

Workaround is to enter the password again.

I get a similar error on winxp, eclipse version 3 RC1. I'm trying to set up a 
new cvs repository location using ssh2. After choosing connection type ext, and 
pressing finish, i get:

Error validating location: ""
Keep location anyway?
... I should also add that when I answer yes on the previous question, the 
location i created. When I expand "HEAD", I get the following message:

Hold down the Ctrl key and try selecting different items in the list in the tree
view.  This seems to be treated as a double-click, which opens one of the
items.  What's worse is that it expands the top-most item in the current
selection that has not already been expanded.  This is sometimes quite distant
from the current selection (e.g., try a "shift" selection and then move
elsewhere and try to add to the selection using "ctrl").
To clarify, you see this iff you're quickly Ctrl-selecting, right?  I see this 
problem in this quick clicking case, but not if it's done more slowly.

Try it on a Solaris box.  It doesn't have to be very quick at all.

When you do a synchronize job the message in the progress view has a percent 
done in it follwed by the string null.

Created attachment 10849
Scrennshot of message
I can't get this to happen. Is this reproducable for you? If so, could you 
provide the steps?
I take it back. It happens when using the sync toolbar button in the sync view.

*** Bug 63399 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The problem was that we were not providing a task name to the monitor. We have 
since fixed the problem (see bug 60844). However, the progress view should not 
display "null" in this situation. Assigning to UI.

    <WithStack>Running I20040519 on Win2K.  

I have created a dummy plugin that contributes a launch configuration.  The 
launch configuration has its own source lookup director and sourcepath 
computer.  Its source path computer makes use of the Java Source Path computer 
to create the defaults.

When I first bring up the Source Lookup Tab and expand the default, the icons 
of the jar files are missing.  The icons will not show up unless the I try to 
modify the source look up path or invoke a java launch configuration.

I will attach my testcase to reproduce the problem.
Created attachment 10851
Testcase to reproduce the problem
Fixed. The source container label provider first checks for a contributed 
IWorkbenchAdapter on containers, and then (if not present) consults the 
associated sourceContainerPresentation extension (if any). Since the when the 
launch dialog was opened without loading the Java Debug plug-in, the 
contributed workbench adapter was not loaded, and returned no image. As well, 
no sourceContainerPresentation was present for "package fragment root" source 
containers.

Fixed by providing a sourceContainerPresentation for "package framgment root" 
source containers, in plugin.xml. Also added the "jar_obj.gif" image to the 
icons directory (same as the one in debug ui). When the workbench adapter is 
not loaded, a default jar image is now provided.
Please verify, Kevin.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Consider the following test case:

------
Instructions:

1. Launch (locally/remotely) HeapJniCarTest.
   ENSURE that the "Show instance-level information" check box IS checked on the
Profiling Options window.

2. Perform a heap dump by clicking the 'Collect object references' button
3. Press enter until the program terminates
4. Open and refresh the 'Object References Table' view.  Use the small triangle
at the TOP of the view to check 'Show References To' option.
5. Verify the following.
	HeapJniCarTest objects-&gt;1 HeapJniCarTest references to -&gt; 2 Door objects, 1
Wheel array (representing the 4 wheels), and an Engine
	Door objects-&gt;2 Door objects, each referencing to -&gt; 1 Window object	
----------

On HP/UX, HeapJniCarTest does not have a reference to the Wheel array
('[Wheel'). (It does still show the 2 door objects and engine object, though). 

In fact, Class Arrays (i.e. non-primitive arrays) are not shown anywhere in the
data collected on HP-UX.
Problem also happens on Solaris. 
Problem still exists in Hyades 3.1(i1) on HP/UX.
No Wheel array show up. Tested using Hyades 3.1 (i2), build 20040920_1414.
No wheel array showed up when tested on HPUX with the build 3.0_20041101_1032 
(Hyades 3.2(i1))
The reason class arrays are not appearing is because of functionality that was
disabled due to a bug in the 1.3 JVM. We should keep the functionality disabled
for the 1.3 JVM, but reenable it for later JVMs (this is the work described
under 64165).

    <WithStack>Have the Console and Display views stacked at the bottom of the perspective
Have the console on top
Debug to a breakpoint

Display view is brought to the top. Why?
Because the Console isn't linked to the Debugging context anymore, but the Display view is.
I understand why this is happening - but it does present a usability problem. 
Even when there is console output, the Display view seems to win, and comes to 
the top. Any ideas, Jared? It means you can't step with the console visible 
all the time (when the display view is stacked with it).
Jared, why do we update the views on every stack frame selection? It seems to 
me we should only change the view activations/visibility when the selected 
debug model(s) changes. For example, the first time a java stack frame is 
selected, activate views. From that point on, we should do nothing until the 
selected frames debug model(s) change. This would mean that if I change the 
view stacking manually, it would remain the same while stepping in a debug 
session.
This behavior made more sense when the view had the "link with selection" style button. Without that, 
the behavior can obviously be really annoying. The updating will only occur when the contexts change 
now.

Please verify change to LaunchViewContextListener, DarinS.

wasn't up yet.
*** Bug 63856 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
nothing more planned for 3.0
This is still annoying. In latest builds, there's no progress reporting at all in the Progress view. The progress bar stays at 0% during the whole compile, although it says "Launching: (100%)" in the lower right corner of the workbench window.

I think the best fix would be that the launch job triggers a separate build job and then blocks on that other job.

let me provide a use case:

User adds a couple of exception breakpoints via the exception breakpoint button
on the breakpoint view. While debugging the user encounters the exception in
many places in framework code he does not intend to debug--he is interested in
debugging only classes in his source project. The user clicks 'resume' over and
over again and continues to do so in future executions. 

A new user might not realize that the step filters function existed. If he were
to go hunting for the feature, he might look first in the debug view (first in
the actions area, then in the view menu), next in the launch configuration, next
in the breakpoints view none of which would allow him to add step filters which
apply to both of the exception breakpoints he set.

Another possible (and partial) solution might be to add another checkbox to the
dialog which pops up when he sets an exception breakpoint: "restrict to source
project" which would add step filters to include only the source associated with
the launch configuration. Perhaps adding a step filters area to a launch
configuration and having it default to "project source only" is a better way to
address this.

However we choose to address this, the bottom line is that step filters should
be more accessible in the UI and should default to breaking only in source of
the project being debugged. Furthermore one should be able to quickly change
these settings while stepping through code--since this is when one is mostly
like to realize that they are needed.
doh. I obviously hadn't read your comments in bug 62998 when I submitted this.
Can we close this one, or is there a feature request "hidden" in it :-)
Most of what I am asking for is already there. The only feature request would be
that we'd expose some of the filter options on the stack trace context menus
(e.g. Filter Type,  Filter Package, Edit Step Filters...) as buttons in the
debug view otherwise new users might never know that they are there. Jared
seemed to be of a similar oppinion in his comment on bug 62998.
OK - defferer though (that toolbar is getting full).
closing - toolbar space issue.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Is the code for reading feature info in IDEWorkbenchAdvisor.preStartup() 
needed during startup?
The code triggers parsing of each feature  about.* files.
Please consider for M9, to help reduce startup time.

The IDEWorkbenchAdvisor is loading the about info to read the welcome 
perspective id.  I heard a rumour welcome pages were going away, is this IDE 
code still needed?

Also, I think that our AboutInfo should use lazy initialization for each value 
(the current behaviour is to load all values in the #readFeatureInfo method).  I 
have a patch to make that change, but I don't think it will impact this 
particular case.  In order for the welcomePerspectiveId to be returned to the 
IDEWorkbenchAdvisor we need to get the product and then iterator through all 
bundleGroupProviders to find the proper one.  Then we need to get the property 
out of that bundleGroup.  I expect this will cause update to read all the .ini 
files.
Iterating over the bundle groups and checking their id should not load the 
about.* files. Once you know which bundle group you need info for, then the 
corresponding files will be loaded.

I don't know much about the welcome page going away, it may be the new Intro 
work that is going on (and will have the same issues :-)
For the old welcome support, the IDE looks for newly installed features, opens
any new welcome pages, and switches to any corresponding welcome perspective(s).

With the new intro support, we can probably just remove this, but it's a
scenario that WSADIE once cared about.  Dejan, do you know how they want the new
intro support to work when laying down WSADIE on top of an existing WSAD?

WSADIE will have its own intro. We provided support that will allow them to 
selectively reach into WSAD intro content and reference selected links and 
other content. Therefore WSADIE has the option of surfacing some WSAD links, 
pages etc. in their own intro but they don't have to. The idea of the new 
intro is that it should focus on the most important features of the top-most 
product, rather than being a mechanical list of 'Welcome to...'. Of course, 
there is always 'About' dialog with a list of features.
The about dialog doesn't require talking to Update Core.
So let's just pull the code from preStartup.

Created attachment 11483
remove feature parsing during #preStartup

This patch changes the #preStartup behaviour to avoid parsing features.  In RC1
the behaviour was to parse the features on startup to build a list of new
welcome perspective ids.  However, this list wouldn't be used unless the new
intro EP was not extended.  This patch changes the startup so that the list is
not built in that case either.

I've tested this on the base eclipse install (an intro extension exists) and
observed in the debugger that the feature parsing does not happen.  I also
modified the platform plugin.xml file to remove the intro extension an observed
the legacy behaviour (features parsed and welcome page opened on first run).
Created attachment 11486
changed line ending

Same content, but I've changed from PC to UNIX line ending to see if that fixes
the format when viewed in my browser.
Created attachment 11487
another attempt at proper line endings

Same content.

This time I'm using a .txt extension to try to fix the format.
Created attachment 11488
final attempt at nice line endings (same content)

This time I didn't click the "patch" box.
The patch has been reviewed by tod and submitted to HEAD.
I've verified that this fix is in the may 7 integration build.</WithStack>

* Pref set to launch *without* waiting for build
* Workspace was building org.eclipse.debug.ui plugin in backgrund
* Launched runtime workbench
* Pressed cancel when progress montior showed "Establishing debug 
connection..."
* Launch job was removed from queue (after a few seconds), and nothing 
appeared in debug view, but the target workbench was still launched - i.e. it 
appeared and was running

Not sure if this is a PDE or JDT debug. Looks like someone is ignoring 
the "cancel" on the progress monitor
Looks like there is a potential for a launch to be cancelled after the 
delegate has completed launching and the time we check for the cancellation. 
This means the delegate has completed, and can no longer cancel the launch, 
but the platform does not know, and removes the launch from the launch manager.
Closing
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I was under the impression that the about info and other places in UI should 
be independent of features, and use IProduct and IBundleGroup instead.
Currently, there are still calls to get the primary feature, etc. which should 
be replaced by Platform.getProduct(), etc.
yes, I saw this too while doing some performance work.  Everything needed 
should be availble from IProduct and IBundleGroup.  Using the feature support 
is duplicating work already done by update.

We only converted UI, not IDE.  But it should be possible to get away from
features in IDE as well.  There was another bug reported about the performance
impact of this, but I'll keep this separate.


See bug 68982 also.

The key issue here is for the UI to define a Product extension.  If it did this 
then 
a) it would be a good example for others
b) it would avoid running a mess of legacy code in Update which ends up reading 
a mess o files etc etc. (i.e., performance gain)
Jeff is particularly interested in having IDEWorkbenchPlugin.getPrimaryInfo 
fixed, as it seems to get called alot.  The method retrieves the current 
platform configuration which causes update to do alot of work.

Even if we don't get all of IDE off the old stuff, it should be possible to 
update the commonly used methods (such as this one).

Template Log File
Problem is an incorrect name for the Associated Events attribute resolvedEvents 
in ICBEPropertyConstants.

The following value:

public static final String ASSOCIATEDEVENT_RESOLVEDEVENT			
	= "resolvedEvent";

should be:

public static final String ASSOCIATEDEVENT_RESOLVEDEVENT			
	= "resolvedEvents";

Because the attribute was not found the CBEFormatter class tries to log a 
message but this throws a null pointer exception.   Here is the code:

CommonBaseEvent event = getEventFactory().createCommonBaseEvent();
							    
event.getMsgDataElement().setMsgCatalogId
("HyadesGA_CBE_Formatter_Invalid_AssociatedEvent_WARN_");
							    
event.getMsgDataElement().setMsgCatalogTokensAsStrings(new String[]{getUniqueID
(),(String)path.get(4)});						
	    
event.setSeverity(CommonBaseEvent.SEVERITY_WARNING);

log(event);

event.getMsgDataElement() is null.
Fixes for these problems:

Fixes:
1) fix the typo in 
org.eclipse.hyades.logging.adapter.ICBEPropertyConstants.ASSOCIATEDEVENT_RESOLVE
DEVENT
2) Component.getEventFactory was fixed by adding a eventFactory.setCompleteEvent
(true); call so that when the CBE is generated the template handler will be run 
to complete the initialization of the CBE.
3) Component.log(CommonBaseEvent event) was fixed by adding || msg.length() == 
0  to the end of  if(msg == null)  This is necessary because the template 
handler sets the CBE msg to an empty string instead of null.  This change will 
cause the msg attribute to be filled with the correct text based on 
msgCatalogId and msgCatalogTokens.
4) Added the following to the Component.clean() method to prevent a 
NullPointerException during Context cleanup.

    <WithStack>I'm trying to setup a Linux PDE Dev Env using the 0506 GTK linux driver.  I'm 
loading my code from a cvs repository and there is one file that eclipse can't 
open; either in an editor or to compile with.  If I open it in the java editor 
the editor shows an Charactor Encoding Problems - This file is unreadable 
using the "UTF-8" character encodng.  

When I right click on the file to look at its properties the Text file 
encoding is set to Default (inherited from container UTF-8).  All the files in 
that package have the same settings and I can open them.  On Windows the same 
file's encoding is set to Default (inherited from container CP1252) and it 
works fine.

Using my windows machine I've tried blasting the file from the repository and 
adding it back by renaming the file and then renaming it back.  I've also 
tried blasting the file and adding it back by creating a new file and pasting 
the contents in it; neither strategies have worked.

Are there any immediate workarounds?  Might there be a fix in a newer eclipse 
driver?
Moving to Platform Text for comments
It seems that File.getCharset does not reliably detect encoding in some cases. 

See comment 0 for one case. 

One other case here:

1. Create a UTF-8 file
(on Linux: echo "abcäöü" | iconv -f LATIN1 -t utf-8 - &gt; UTF8_3.java)

2. In eclipse, create a source folder with ISO 8858-1 encoding
2. Copy the file to some eclipse workspace and refresh it
3. Open the file with the java editor.

Observe: the file has content type ISO 8859-1 encoding inherited from its parent
Expected: UTF-8 encoding detected.

Breakpoint in File.getCharset(boolean) seems to return the default char set (and
ContentDescriptionManager returns the default description) for the file. 
moving to core for comments
The problem originally reported is probably caused due to the fact that the file
happens to have some non-ascii character that was encoded using an encoding
different than UTF-8. For instance, a Windows machine was used to commit the
file, using the default encoding (for instance, Cp1252). On Linux, the default
encoding for the Java VM is usually UTF-8, so you will have problems reading
such a file.

You should ensure clients use the same encoding. You can do that at the
workspace level (Workbench-&gt;Text editors-&gt;Text file encoding), project, folder
(using the properties dialog), or file level (using the properties dialog or the
Edit-&gt;Encoding... action). Let us know if that works.

Tom, the scenario you point out does not work because, for plain text files, we
will only recognize a particular encoding if:
- the file has a Unicode BOM (UTF-16 Big/Little Endian usually have, UTF-8
optionally have)
- the content type defines a default charset for that file. Java files don't
have any implicit default encoding
Dropping severity because it seems we do not even have a bug here and because
those bold red letters scare me.

Seriously, if after reading my comments above somebody still see an issue here,
let me know, otherwise I am going to mark this one as invalid.
Using N200405240010 on Linux/GTK

If I check out jdt.ui:
The project was not built since the source file
/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/ui/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/ui/search/SearchResultUpdater.java
could not be read.

How is one supposed to work around this?  If I look at my list of encodings,
UTF-8 shows up as the only one.  None of the other editors will load the file.

Luckily iconv will tell me the offending character, could we provide a similar
function to at least tell us where in the file?
The list of encodings in the UI for selecting the workspace/resource encoding is
only a list of suggestions, you can enter whatever (valid) encoding you want
there. In previous builds, the list would contain many popular encodings in it
(depending on the locale). Due to bug 62920 in Platform/UI, the only encoding
being shown in M9 seems to be the VM default encoding, but that is just an
annoyance, it should not prevent you from setting the encoding you want.

Telling users where the error the file is might be interesting, just not sure we
have enough infrastructure from Java or we would have to do this magic
ourselves. Anyway, this would look like a feature request against Platform/Text,
since at the  Core level we don't care much about contents.

BTW, what is the problem with the mentioned file? Does it have a non-ascii char?
The character in question wasn't exactly non-ascii but had a different encoding
between CP1252 and UTF-8.  Go blame it on those umlaut'ed characters, guess
people in Europe will have to be careful with their names.
Why would you blame the umlauts? They are normally ASCII chars and should not be
a problem. Can you explain i.e. concretely tell us which character(s) in that
file don't work for you.
I meant they are part of the extended ASCII codes when having 8 bit. I can
remember having problem with some special ' that once got pasted from outside
into a file.
The umlaut (in the case of SearchResultUpdater.java in the @author tag) is
indeed the problem. Umlauts are only part of various extended 8bit ASCII sets
such as Cp1252, but (as Rafael pointed out in comment 4) have a different
representation in UTF8 vs. ISO-8859-1 (or Cp1252). 

If you save this file content:

&lt;pre&gt;
abc
הצ�
&lt;/pre&gt;

In UTF8, you will get this hexdump -c:

a   b   c  \n 303 244 303 266 303 274  \n

As Cp1252, you will get this:

a   b   c  \n 344 366 374  \n

----

The workaround for this bug is to set the project encoding as outlined in comment 4.

However, there are two interesting points:

1) Does the eclipse cvs repository enforce a server-side encoding? Or might we
have various coexisting encodings if people from around the world include their
native names in author tags?

2) This should go into a different PR and might be turned down for performance
reasons: why should we not be able to detect UTF-8 without a BOM? the linux
"file" utility does it quite reliably by looking at the file contents (probably
capped to a certain amount of characters) and searching for multi-byte characters.
re. comment 11:

1) A quick glance at the eclipse repository shows that SearchResultUpdater.java
is saved as ISO-8859-1, not UTF. Sounds like fun.

2) filed bug 63788 for the UTF8 detection.

Tom, AFAIK, CVS treats all files as having binary contents, except for line breaks.

Re: "SearchResultUpdater.java is saved as ISO-8859-1, not UTF"

Not sure I got it... was not that expected? Why?
Thanks for the help; turns out I had a bunch of funny quotes /221 and /222 
instead of plain old '
re comment 13

Since cvs cannot handle encodings really, this is probably expected - however,
if we don't agree on an encoding within the eclipse project, we may end up with
various charsets coexisting or even conflicting. Imagine a Thai commiter adding
his name in a Thai locale below the one by Thomas Mäder in the above file.
no direct relationship with this bug, however. ok to close from my perspective.
This is why setting a project level default encoding is a good idea for even for
teams that are in the same area (since different OSes don't agree on the default
locale). It will be shared so all committers will be using the same settings.

Marking as invalid.
I SOLVED IT AT WSAD.

I was getting the same error message, and I was trying to rebuild
my project all the day, finally here is the solution:

The error message was:

The project was not build since the source file &lt;..project 
name/package/myClassName.java...&gt; could not be read


In fact the java class was not there..It belong to a previous release, it
was deleted already from my workspace.

It was not even listed on the Package explorer.
I restarted WSAD and now it was there at the Package explorer.

I got all the application code again (I am using PVCS) and I got the same 
problem, I was not able the encoding using the right click and selecting 
encoding from the file properties. So I just delete the file from the
Package explorer(this time was not hiden). I was able to delete it and the next 
rebuild was just fine.

I hope it help.

driver?
Moving to Platform Text for comments
It seems that File.getCharset does not reliably detect encoding in some cases. 

See comment 0 for one case. 

One other case here:

1. Create a UTF-8 file
(on Linux: echo "abcäöü" | iconv -f LATIN1 -t utf-8 - &gt; UTF8_3.java)

2. In eclipse, create a source folder with ISO 8858-1 encoding
2. Copy the file to some eclipse workspace and refresh it
3. Open the file with the java editor.

Observe: the file has content type ISO 8859-1 encoding inherited from its parent
Expected: UTF-8 encoding detected.

Breakpoint in File.getCharset(boolean) seems to return the default char set (and
ContentDescriptionManager returns the default description) for the file. 
moving to core for comments
The problem originally reported is probably caused due to the fact that the file
happens to have some non-ascii character that was encoded using an encoding
different than UTF-8. For instance, a Windows machine was used to commit the
file, using the default encoding (for instance, Cp1252). On Linux, the default
encoding for the Java VM is usually UTF-8, so you will have problems reading
such a file.

You should ensure clients use the same encoding. You can do that at the
workspace level (Workbench-&gt;Text editors-&gt;Text file encoding), project, folder
(using the properties dialog), or file level (using the properties dialog or the
Edit-&gt;Encoding... action). Let us know if that works.

Tom, the scenario you point out does not work because, for plain text files, we
will only recognize a particular encoding if:
- the file has a Unicode BOM (UTF-16 Big/Little Endian usually have, UTF-8
optionally have)
- the content type defines a default charset for that file. Java files don't
have any implicit default encoding
Dropping severity because it seems we do not even have a bug here and because
those bold red letters scare me.

Seriously, if after reading my comments above somebody still see an issue here,
let me know, otherwise I am going to mark this one as invalid.
Using N200405240010 on Linux/GTK

If I check out jdt.ui:
The project was not built since the source file
/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/ui/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/ui/search/SearchResultUpdater.java
could not be read.

How is one supposed to work around this?  If I look at my list of encodings,
UTF-8 shows up as the only one.  None of the other editors will load the file.

Luckily iconv will tell me the offending character, could we provide a similar
function to at least tell us where in the file?
The list of encodings in the UI for selecting the workspace/resource encoding is
only a list of suggestions, you can enter whatever (valid) encoding you want
there. In previous builds, the list would contain many popular encodings in it
(depending on the locale). Due to bug 62920 in Platform/UI, the only encoding
being shown in M9 seems to be the VM default encoding, but that is just an
annoyance, it should not prevent you from setting the encoding you want.

Telling users where the error the file is might be interesting, just not sure we
have enough infrastructure from Java or we would have to do this magic
ourselves. Anyway, this would look like a feature request against Platform/Text,
since at the  Core level we don't care much about contents.

BTW, what is the problem with the mentioned file? Does it have a non-ascii char?
The character in question wasn't exactly non-ascii but had a different encoding
between CP1252 and UTF-8.  Go blame it on those umlaut'ed characters, guess
people in Europe will have to be careful with their names.
Why would you blame the umlauts? They are normally ASCII chars and should not be
a problem. Can you explain i.e. concretely tell us which character(s) in that
file don't work for you.
I meant they are part of the extended ASCII codes when having 8 bit. I can
remember having problem with some special ' that once got pasted from outside
into a file.
The umlaut (in the case of SearchResultUpdater.java in the @author tag) is
indeed the problem. Umlauts are only part of various extended 8bit ASCII sets
such as Cp1252, but (as Rafael pointed out in comment 4) have a different
representation in UTF8 vs. ISO-8859-1 (or Cp1252). 

If you save this file content:

&lt;pre&gt;
abc
הצ�
&lt;/pre&gt;

In UTF8, you will get this hexdump -c:

a   b   c  \n 303 244 303 266 303 274  \n

As Cp1252, you will get this:

a   b   c  \n 344 366 374  \n

----

The workaround for this bug is to set the project encoding as outlined in comment 4.

However, there are two interesting points:

1) Does the eclipse cvs repository enforce a server-side encoding? Or might we
have various coexisting encodings if people from around the world include their
native names in author tags?

2) This should go into a different PR and might be turned down for performance
reasons: why should we not be able to detect UTF-8 without a BOM? the linux
"file" utility does it quite reliably by looking at the file contents (probably
capped to a certain amount of characters) and searching for multi-byte characters.
re. comment 11:

1) A quick glance at the eclipse repository shows that SearchResultUpdater.java
is saved as ISO-8859-1, not UTF. Sounds like fun.

2) filed bug 63788 for the UTF8 detection.

Tom, AFAIK, CVS treats all files as having binary contents, except for line breaks.

Re: "SearchResultUpdater.java is saved as ISO-8859-1, not UTF"

Not sure I got it... was not that expected? Why?
Thanks for the help; turns out I had a bunch of funny quotes /221 and /222 
instead of plain old '
re comment 13

Since cvs cannot handle encodings really, this is probably expected - however,
if we don't agree on an encoding within the eclipse project, we may end up with
various charsets coexisting or even conflicting. Imagine a Thai commiter adding
his name in a Thai locale below the one by Thomas Mäder in the above file.
no direct relationship with this bug, however. ok to close from my perspective.
This is why setting a project level default encoding is a good idea for even for
teams that are in the same area (since different OSes don't agree on the default
locale). It will be shared so all committers will be using the same settings.

Marking as invalid.
I SOLVED IT AT WSAD.

I was getting the same error message, and I was trying to rebuild
my project all the day, finally here is the solution:

The error message was:

The project was not build since the source file &lt;..project 
name/package/myClassName.java...&gt; could not be read


In fact the java class was not there..It belong to a previous release, it
was deleted already from my workspace.

It was not even listed on the Package explorer.
I restarted WSAD and now it was there at the Package explorer.

I got all the application code again (I am using PVCS) and I got the same 
problem, I was not able the encoding using the right click and selecting 
encoding from the file properties. So I just delete the file from the
Package explorer(this time was not hiden). I was able to delete it and the next 
rebuild was just fine.

I hope it help.

Darin, isn't this an LCD problem, rather than a PDE problem?
Looks like a Mac issue with a tabbed pane. Moving to SWT.
I don't think we can do any here. On Windows, the tab folder adds two arrows to scroll through the tabs 
when the tab folder is too small to show all tabs. Mac does not. 
This makes the dialog really unusable, particularly for the "Junit Plug-in Test"
configuration. I tried using it today but could never return to the first tab. Try:
- Go to "Run-&gt;Run..."
- Create a new "Junit Plug-in Test"
- The first tab shown is the "Test" tab
- Go to the "Arguments" tab
- Try to return to the "Test" tabs. It's not possible.
This means that for every configuration you create, as soon as you leave the
first tab, you'll never be able to go back to it.

I typed something like TextLayout layout = new TextLayout(); (SWT class) and
pressed CTRL+SPACE when the caret was inside the parenthesis. Normally, I would
expect this to bring up a list of constructor choices. However, TextLayout has
no default constructor (with no params), and thus instead I see on the status
line: The constructor TextLayout() is undefined. However, if I press CTRL+SPACE
when the caret is inbetween the right parenthesis and semi-colon, code assist
comes up, and if I press left arrow, I get the desired constructor code assist.
I tried this out on a object which had a default constructor with no parameters
and another constructor, and the code assist properly appeared when I hit
CTRL+SPACE. Hopefully this isn't a dupe or desired behavior as I searched high
and low:)
I can reproduce the behavior that you describe with

import org.eclipse.swt.graphics.TextLayout;
public class X {
  void foo() {
    TextLayout layout = new TextLayout(); 
  }
}

There is no bug with this test case.
The constructor with no param does not exist but "TextLayout (Device device)" 
exists.
1) When the caret is inside the parenthesis the compile error can be seen in 
the status bar.
2) When you perform codeassist the only one completion is "TextLayout (Device 
device)" and if the option "Insert single proposals automaticaly" is enabled 
then this proposals is inserted without showing you a proposals list.

I close this bug. If my test case is not correct reopen it.

In this case, is there an alternate way to bring up the javadoc that would come
up with code assist for the constructor? Also, this problem occurs when the
option "Insert common prefixes automatically" is checked.
I don't know how to bring up the javadoc when the option "Insert common 
prefixes automatically" is enabled and there is only one proposal. I think 
it's currently not possible.
Then I would argue strongly that in this case CTRL+SPACE should show the code
assist + javadoc.
reopen
move to JDT/UI for comment.
I had this pref disabled and I got content assist that's why I sent it down to J
Core.

I agree that this preference should not affect above test case and context
assist should appear.
Since nothing is actually being inserted, then the "insert xxx" preferences 
should not affect the behavior here.
Works for me using 3.7 M2.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>It would be nice if color and font attributes could be set on a TableColumn.  I have an application in 
development and that is a feature my users are requesting.
To clarify, when you say TableColumn you mean its header, right?  Assuming so, 
moving to SN to consider api request post-3.0.

If you want to set the font/color for all _items_ in a specific column then you 
can currently loop through the TableItems and invoke 
setFont/Foreground/Background(int, ...) on each.

Originally, I meant the items because I didn't think about accessing table items (I've been focused on 
learning jface).  Setting the font / color of all items in a column in one call would be very convenient 
though.  Setting the header color / font would also be a nice enhancement.
Now that table cells can have their own paint event handler, is there any chance we could see the same functionality exposed for column headers?

(I bet you folks anticipated that request.  ;)
There are similiar requests for TableColumn color in bug 153440.

&gt; Not for 3.3.
&gt; 

any news about this bug ? is it planned for the 3.4 version ?

any workarround to customize the header color ?

many thanks,
Anis
I would also like to know if this is planned for 3.4
I'm sorry but the 3.4 boat has sailed.  The release is within the next week or two and we won't change any code now.
Updates?  Currently I'm still stuck putting a colored image in TableColumn to make it appear as thou it has a background color.  
Again, to answer the workaround questions, I've been putting a red image (with the desired text), it a certain TableColumn header.  Then upon sort, I have to swap out that image another image that has an ascending/descending arrow in it?  Basically I mimic the default sorting behavior with the up/down arrow (or no sort arrow at all).  This is a pain at the moment, but it does work for a workaround.  Any further invesitgation or progress with this issue?
Guys, this bug has been around for 4 1/2 years.  Any chance this can happen in the next release?  Not having the ability to control the appearance of the header severely limits the visual appeal of lists we place in our UI.

As an aside, I'm wondering if your recommendation is to use the Nebula Grid ...and simply to quit using Eclipse's tables?

Wow!

We have been building an RCP where we are trying to highly customize colors (reverse-video like). We ran into this glaring ommission pretty early on. Could this be, well, added for 3.5 at this point? :-(
Any updates to this bug, its been a year now
This would be very useful to us.
Does anyone know if this possible on win32, gtk, cocoa, carbon ?
This should be listed as a defect not an enhancement!
Any updates on this?Waiting for the solution/work around. I am setting the same fonts, font size, foreground and background colors to all controls on my composite, BUT unfortunately am not able to set the foreground and background colors for table headers thus table dosen't looks good to user.
Has this problem been resolved?</WithStack>

Found 1 deadlock.
This may be a similar underlying cause as bug 50370
Investigate for RC1.
I have a fix for this problem.
By modifying the code of JDIStackFrame#getUnderlyingStackFrame() (using a local
variable instead of the attribute as a tempory variable), we can remove the
synchronization of JDIStackFrame#setUnderlyingStackFrame().

Changes in JDIStackFrame.
Please verify, Darin(s).
*** Bug 50370 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I think this fix breaks bug 45211.
Kevin has a suggestion that I am experimenting with (so far it works). The 
basic problem is that we want to ensure atomic update of the stack frame 
state. The deadlock is caused by the fact that there are two locks (one on the 
thread, on one the stack frame). Thus, if the stack frame synchronizes on the 
thread, rather than itself, there is only one lock - updates are atomic, and 
there is no deadlock (just potentially slower - but I can't see/feel a 
difference). This makes logical sense - the story is that if anyone wants to 
change thread state (step, resume, drop) they have to have a lock on the 
thread (which they did already), and if anyone wants to update a frame (which 
is really thread state), they have to have a lock on the thread (this is the 
new part of the solution).
... my fix breaks my previous fix ... :/

Synchronizing on the thread should solve the problem.
Released fix - all synch is done on the thread now to avoid two locks.
Please verify, Luc.

    <WithStack>I checked out out an entire repo and then disconnected the project. I
reconnected using dot (.) as the module name. Everything worked fine except that
I have a directory in my repo that ends in dot which is not valid in eclipse.
This failure caused the share to sfail even though the other files where shared
properly. The Sharing wizard was left on the tag seleciton page with Next and
Cancel enabled but Finish disabled. Clickin Next reperformed the share with the
same results. Clicking cancel left the project shared.

Ideally, it would be better if this failure didn't stop the Sahring wizard from
going to the last page. An error dialog could still be shown but the user could
still be shown the results and could then click Finish. Alternatively, the same
behavior could remain but the cancel could prompt to leave the project shared.
Investigate for RC1 in case there is something simple we can do
Added the code but it doesn't fail on Windows. I'll try it on GTK.

I mixed DOM AST nodes and Compiler AST nodes...

Fixed.

Now, binding stored for constructor selector in Javadoc DOM AST node hierarchy
is a type binding instead of a method binding.

[jdt-core-internal]
Change done in class ASTConverter method
recordNodes(org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.Javadoc,TagElement).

No specific test cases added. Change has been done in verifyBindings(TagElement)
method of ASTConverterJavadocTests to verify that new behavior is correctly
implemented.

Finally test case was added in ASTConverterJavadocTest.
Verified in 200405281200</WithStack>

Saving a file whose contents originally had a UTF-16 Little Endian BOM will
always change the BOM to be a UTF-16 Big Endian.



1 - After saving the contents externally (I use Notepad on XP to change the BOM)
with Unicode (= UTF-16 Little Endian BOM), force a refresh on the changed file.
The properties dialog will show the file has a UTF-16 encoding with a Little
Endian BOM. 
2 - Open the file with the text editor. The right encoding will be used to read
the file contents. 
3 - Make some changes in the editor and save. The properties dialog (Notepad as
well) will show the file has a UTF-16 encoding with a Big Endian BOM (should
still be Little Endian).

    <Summery>Proposal:  Add a "runtime-only" tag to all.maps file in order to improve efficiency of packager tool</Summery>

    <WithStack>Currently, there are two tags available as content filters for the packager 
tool, runtime and sdk.  However, some features(CDT, for example) are available 
as runtime only.  Therefore, in order to build a package containing all 
features, one must specify "contentFilter=runtime, sdk".  This necessitates 
downloading all runtime and sdk packages, even when the runtime zips are 
redundant.

A solution is to add a runtime-only tag to the configs in the all.maps file.  
runtime-only would be used in addition to runtime in packages that do not have 
a corresponding sdk.  CDT would be "|runtime, runtime-only|" for example.  This 
would allow users to set their contentFilter variable to "sdk, runtime-only" in 
order to avoid downloading extraneous files.
This is a decision of the IES team.
CC'ing Jeff for comment.
The list of tags has never been limited but I believe it should be a decision
that should be taken with the leaders of IES.</WithStack>

Fixed in VariablesViewContentProvider and LogicalObjectStructureInterfaceType.

The root of the problem as that LogicalObjectStructureInterfaceType was 
returning "null" for a logical structure (not allowed by API). It was doing 
this since the evaluation performed for the "shell" in the selected stack 
frame threw an runtime exception (since it was disposed). The logical 
structure code should have thrown an exception instead (which it now does).

I also fixed up the VariablesViewContentProvider to safeguard against null 
being returned from a logical structure type, even though API says it should 
not happen.
Please verify, Kevin.

Eclipse 200405140800

I have a large (&gt;300 file) project.  When I define a working set that contains a
subset of these files and search for enumeration declarations - search will kill
eclipse after 7 minutes because it has run out of memory.

Please let me know if you want a copy of the project I am using.

Note:  I was unable to reproduce this problem on Windows
Out of interest, does the same problem occur if you start Eclipse w/512MB of 
memory (as compared to the 256 which is default)?
I tried 2 consecutive searches (where the IDE was configured with 512MB) and did
not get the out-of-memory error, but each search took &lt;7 minutes to complete.

Worth noting:  I always get the correct # of results in the first 30 seconds,
but the remainder of the search just drags on.  And when using 256MB, I get the
out-of-memory error.
Bog, we'll need to sit down and debug this post-M9Interesting that .  
I'm pretty sure this is platform related... Do you get a stack trace?
Unfortunately no.
James - Is this reproducible on a M9 build?
I will move this to 2.0.1.  We are targeting 2.0.1 to improve parser 
performance and memory usage.
Andrew, please validate as to whether or not this has been solved.  
James, what project were you using to reproduce this exception?
Thanks in advance
Using the latest from the 2.0.1 branch with default memory size (256?), I was 
able to search for * in a workspace containing approx 800 files of generated 
source.  It took approx 3 minutes to find almost 10k matches with no memory 
problems.</WithStack>

To reproduce:
1. open the synchronize view in your current perspective and ensure that the
views width is small (e.g. width of the navigator).
2. synchronize a project, it should be shown in the synchronize view. notice the
toolbar items, there should be 11!).
3. merge a project (e.g. Team &gt; Merge...) and the merge will be shown in the
sync view, note the toolbar as been updated for the new merge page.
4. using the first toolbar button in the sync view, change to the previous
synchronize by selecting it from the dropdown.
5. notice that the toolbar now only shows 5 items.
6. if you resize the view they will appear.

Expectation: the views toolbar would resize correctly when the page book view
switches to another page. if required the toolbar may have to resize.
I have not rechecked, but this might be a dup of bug 64866.
We have fixed a number of bugs like this in the past. Please reopen with steps to reproduce in 3.3 if this happens again.</WithStack>

Veronika, The defect is in product 'VE', component 'SWT' - basically a VE defect
with regards to SWT.
The problem was happening becuase the snippet update process doesnt take into
account the new code style used for SWT. When the shell title was updated, the
snippet update process thought that the createTable() statement was being
removed, and removes the table completely. 
Added support for the new code style in the class BDMMerger.

    <WithStack>I had several projects in my workspace for which there were serveral incoming
changes that were not yet in the sync view. I then synced with the sync view in
incoming mode using the Commit set layout. I do not have "always run in
background" on so I got several progress dialogs in a row popping up briefly.
Actually I was in both mode. Strange but the second time I did it, I switch to
bugzilla befor eit was done. When I switched back, the view only had a few
entries in it. Swithcing modes showed the proper view contents.
Re comment #1; I tried this again and it appears that the commit set does not
update to new incoming changes

    <WithStack>I created a simple project and added a META-INF folder. When I added a
MANIFEST.MF file (no plugin.xml so far), a PDE editor opened... I thought: "cool!".

To my surprise, I could edit many fields in the JAR manifest using the GUI PDE
provides, except:
- version (Overview tab) - keeps disappearing when I leave the field or press
&lt;enter&gt;
- adding an extension causes a NPE
- adding an extension point causes a NPE

Although it would be great if a plugin.xml were automatically created for me
when I saved the MANIFEST.MF using PDE's editor, I would not go that far (not
for 3.0). I have a problem with the NPEs though. The actions should not be
enabled, or a message should be presented to the user if it does not make sense
in the current context.
Of course, Rafael is the first one to stumble upon this one.
Creating a plugin.xml on the fly is the only missing link remaining..
I got there by accident... I was actually testing our code, creating a bogus
manifest file manually in the text edtor, but was (gladly) surprised to get
PDE's editor instead. Couldn't resist playing a little bit with it...
We have the code in RC2 that does most of the work required here, but there is 
an issue with creating a new extension from a template. We used to make a call 
to ensure that plugin.xml is created (and the required changed made in the 
editor) when 'finish' is pressed in the new extension wizard. However, when we 
enter the template wizard, it takes over and its 'finish' is called first.

The proposed fix is to override WizardDialog and make a call to ensure 
manifest is created in 'okPressed'. This works well in both cases because the 
file is created prior to any wizard using it.

This is important enough to be included in RC3. Wassim?
Created attachment 12186
Patch for fixing the template NPE when manifest file is missing
The attached patch also addresses the problem that the newly created 
plugin.xml did not have schema version == 3.0.
An enthusiastic +1 for RC3
Fixed.

    <WithStack>I am using Build id: 200405190010.

Steps (I tried this on a fresh workspace):
- Open the the Java perspective
- Open the CVS perspective
- Drag the perspective bar to the left, until you see 3 perspectives
- The chevron is still visible
- Select it -&gt; it contains all the open perspectives even though they are
visible in the perspective bar

This is a different behavior than on Windows. On the latter OS, only the
invisible items are listed in the chevron. Once all of the items are visible,
the chevron disappears (unlike on Mac OS X).
This seems to be fixed in 3.0RC1 (on Mac OS 10.3.3).

    <WithStack>We need to have a readme item for the sun jvm bug described in bug 56404. 

Basically, because of a sun jvm bug, when profiling, the jvm may crash. This can
be avoided if the *only* the Execution Analysis mode is used (WITH 'Show
Instance level' info turned OFF), or *only* the Memory Analysis mode is used. If
they are used in combination then the sun jvm bug can arise, or if Execution
Analysis is used with 'Show instance level' info turned on it can also arise.
This occurs in the Sun 1.4.x line of JVM's on Solaris, and potentially with the
1.4.x line of JVM's on HP as well. 
Added to readme.  Will be posted today (June 8, 2004)
As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant enhancements/defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed. If this enhancement/defect is still unresolved and reproducible in the latest TPTP release (http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/), please re-open.</WithStack>

I should clarify, it's the Navigate menu that's not showing any item texts in 
my attachment.

It only happens on Win98 ?
yes, it seems to be fine on win2000

Please check org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Menu.update()
I'm not sure but codes after comment of windows's bug (ll.1294-1305) may be
incorrect.

Steve, the fix for bug#32537 was introduced this problem (as Toshihiro has 
pointed out in comment#3).
I verified that removing the fix for bug#32537 fixes this bug. I've worked 
about one hour trying to find a simple test case to reproduce the problem but I 
didn't get anywhere. Maybe we would look at this problem together tomorrow.
Fixed, the workaround for Bug32537 won't run on Win98 for now.

I have a .log file in my target workspace metadata area. I use the "simulated
startup" self-hosting style. If I run a runtime workbench and an error occurs
early in the startup sequence (way before we try to run the application), the
log is written to the configuration area, but PDE will show me the log in the
workspace metadata area.
We check the timestamps on all the *.log files in the config area and the one 
in the workspace and show you the latest one.

Do you have tangible evidence that the not-so-latest one was picked?
Hmm... I guess somebody it touching the workspace log as well. Both have the
same file system timestamps, although the log in the workspace was not recently
touched (the last session is previous than the last session in the configuration
area's log). Will see if I understand what is going on... 
Please disregard my previous comment... I could actually see that a newer log
file in the config area was been ignored in favour of an older one in the
workspace metadata location. I then deleted the log in the workspace metadata
location, and PDE stopped asking if I wanted to see the log file, even when a
new one was just created in the configuration area.
did you change the location in the config area since I put in that code for M8?
Where would the logs be found?
In the config. area's root: &lt;...&gt;/configuration/&lt;timestamp&gt;.log

&lt;root&gt;
  +- plugins
  +- features
  +- configuration
  |     +- 1084993860761.log
  |     +- config.ini
  |     + ...
  +- .eclipseproduct
Looking at the code, this is definitely a regression.
We used to persist the config area on the launch, so that we could check it 
for logs upon abnormal termination.
At some point during the M8 cycle, we accidentally omitted this step, and that 
is why we are not showing the logs in the config area.
Fixed.
Disaster averted.  Let us put this ugliness behind us.
Unless I am crazy (not unlikely) this is happening again with 200405250800. If I
happen to have a .log in the workspace, that is the file being shown to me, even
when the &lt;timestamp&gt;.log file in the configuration area is newer than that one.
Are you specifying your own configuration area or are you going with the one 
that PDE generates?  
If you specify your own via -configuration, that would be a problem.
I am not specifying -configuration. Still using the "simulated normal startup"
self-hosting style.
ok, that's the problem.  Didn't read the original description carefully.  
Didn't think anybody uses this setup other than the Update team.
This could be fixed.
Fixed in RC1.</WithStack>

This can happen if the viewer has not been created yet? Does it make sense to
add a null check here? Or is there a view creation ordering problem?

This can happen if the viewer has not been created yet? Does it make sense to
add a null check here? Or is there a view creation ordering problem?
Investigate in RC1.
I haven't seen this since. Perhaps it was fixed by UI.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>The label for the compress folder layout is really not needed. We should just
decide on the default and since the layouts are now persisted, we don't need the
preference.
Actually we still need it so that users can decide the default layout to use.
But we may have to add something similar to use commit set layout for CVS
synchronizations.
I'm not going to add the CVS flag since this layout is work-in-progress :)
Changed the preference in Team though. Fixed.</WithStack>

CDT build number: 200405121551
TestCase number: QE_TestCase_P1_I18N211, QE_TestCase_P1_I18N212

Test Case:
1. Change the locale to Spanish from control panel.
2. Restart eclipse &amp; create a Java or C/C++ project. Create a file under the 
project and add code to it such that the file size exceeds 1000 bytes.
3. Right click on file and go to Properties. The file size specified there is 
not formatted according to the locale selected.
4. Go to Windows-&gt;Show view-&gt;Properties. The file size is not number formatted 
in the properties view for the locale as well.
We get this value from the virtual machine (Long.toString(localFile.length()) 
so the issue is with the virtual machine.
Marking WONTFIX as there is nothing we can do.
The way numbers are displayed should pick up on the locale setting using Locale 
sensitive APIs. In Java, there are 2 ways: NumberFormat, or if the number is 
embedded in a string retrieved through a resource bundle, use MessageFormat.

Like this:
public class TestSize {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		File localFile=new File ("test");
		long len = localFile.length();
		
		// use NumberFormat by itself
		NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getInstance();
		String lenStr=nf.format(len);
		System.out.println ("NumberFormat: "+ lenStr);
		
		// or we can mix NumberFormat with MessageFormat
		System.out.println ("MessageFormat: "+getFormattedString("key", 
new Long(len))); //$NON-NLS-1$
		
	}
	public static String getFormattedString(String key, Long arg) {
		return MessageFormat.format(getString(key), new Object[] { 
arg });
	}
	
	public static String getString (String key) {
		return ("The file size is: {0, number, integer} {0, choice, 
1#byte|2#bytes}");
	}
}


The output would then be (for US English locale): 
NumberFormat: 7,360
MessageFormat: The file size is: 7,360 bytes

the ability to create

this function would require that the data be persisted, but Eclipse apparently 
has no mechanism for storing this global information
Are you using Eclipse or an Eclipse-based product? The -setWorkspace commandline
argument is not an Eclipse thing.

In the latest Eclipse builds if you don't specify a -data option then a
workspace chooser prompt appears and you can choose your workspace from there.

I believe it retains a list of recently used workspaces. This information is

bug in J Core: codeSelect is speced to return JME and not IAE
According to spec, IllegalArgumentException can occur, when requestor is null. 
The spec however omits to declare that such an exception can occur when the 
completion/selection positions are out of the buffer bounds.

This is an error on client's end, for which IllegalArgumentException is meant.

Will request PMC approval to fix the spec, and have it match the 
implementation (implementation has been sending this exception since 20030910).

David please attach the proposed change to spec as a patch.

spec update
Requested PMC approval:

Problem is that our spec doesn't mention IllegalArgumentException when 
completion/location is out of the bounds of the unit source. The 
implementation did change on 20030910. It used to be throwing a 
JavaModelException (pre sept. 2003), and now does instead throw an 
IllegalArgumentException, but we did forget to change the spec accordingly. 
This only denotes a situation where client is out of sync with resource 
contents, which is the reason why we did change to IllegalArgumentException.
Note that we had already spec'ed a scenario where IllegalArgumentException
was thrown (if requestor was null), so this isn't an entirely new scenario 
where clients should now be protecting themselves.
The spec for ICodeAssist.codeSelect very clearly states that 
JavaModelException is thrown if the range specified is not within the 
element's source range. The change to the behavior made in 20030910 introduced 
a bug. Changing the API spec as proposed would be a breaking API change for 
2.1 clients.

David did investigate reverting to JavaModelException, and all looks good. We 
will thus proceed to be backward compatible. No need to change the spec any 
longer.

You can share a project with a remote non-root location (e.g. a/b/c) that
doesn't exist, but if you try and share with an existing non-root location an
error occurs in the sharing wizard saying that it can't find a/b/c.
Fixed
*** Bug 63859 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Are you sure that's the same bug? Because you can share just fine if the same 
project does NOT exist at the root.
I think it is a different symptom of the same bug. When we were sharing a non-
root project, we were looking to see if the project existed at the root 
instead of at the proper position in the folder hierarchy. The share works if 
both the root project and nested project of the same name do not exist but 
fails if either already exist.

    <WithStack>This is truly a nit.  I hesitate to even mention it, but hey, it shows up on 
the very first screen.

The checkbox says "Use this as the default and do not ask again."  and 
includes the PERIOID.  This is not consistent with UI guidelines and I've 
never seen another case of it in Eclipse (not that it is the standard of 
consistency).

As far as I know, the general guideline is to use proper english wherever 
possible.  This should include using a period when a full sentence fits into the 
dialog.

Eclipse certainly isn't consistent in the use of periods, but in my random 
poking, the first two dialogs I checked (File -&gt; New -&gt; Package &amp; File -&gt; New -&gt; 
Class) I found 3 periods and a question mark.  After that I found other dialogs 
(e.g., Search -&gt; Search... -&gt; File Search) that didn't use a period.  The worst 
case I found was the Windows Print dialog (the native dialog that appears on XP 
for File -&gt; Print...) which has a two sentence description, the first sentence 
has a period, the second does not; "Enter either a single page number or a 
single page range.  For example, 5-12"

Since eclipse is currently in the middle I think the true fix is to add periods 
to all fragments that form full sentences, but I don't have strong feelings on 
the matter.

I'm marking this bug as invalid since the true fix is a much bigger issue.
My comment applies only to checkboxes, you are referring to instructions.  
Yes, instructions should definitely be full sentences and include 
punctuation.  I don't believe this applies to checkboxes.  The guidelines 
don't really explicitly say this in:

http://eclipse.org/articles/Article-UI-Guidelines/Contents.html

Here's the closest I could find.  You might ask one of the authors their 
opinion.  Me, I've never seen a period ending a checkbox label before (in 
Windows, Office, or anywhere else).

Guideline 1.5 

Use Headline style capitalization for menus, tooltip and all titles, including 
those used for windows, dialogs, tabs, column headings and push buttons. 
Capitalize the first and last words, and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, 
verbs and adverbs.  Do not include ending punctuation.

Guideline 1.6 

Use Sentence style capitalization for all control labels in a dialog or 
window, including those for check boxes, radio buttons, group labels, and 
simple text fields.  Capitalize the first letter of the first word, and any 
proper names such as the word Java.

sentence-style capitalization with no ending punctuation."

    <WithStack>There is a need to better control the eclipse Help menu, and the update ui is 
now contributing menu items to the Software Updates menu.
It is desireable to have these actions owned by the UI team, and have the 
update component provide the appropriate API to launch them. This will allow 
various customizations in the Help menu, that are beyond the update team's 
control.

The new API has low risk and can be contained for M9.
Nick,

There is a new API called org.eclipse.update.ui.UpdateManagerUI with two 
methods:

openConfigurationManger(shell)
openInstaller(shell)

Copy the InstallWizardAction and ConfigurationManagerAction from 
org.eclipse.update.internal.ui into your own package and also the 
corresponding action set entries from the plugin.xml file, as well as the 
icons used by the actions. 

Once you implement the actions in the UI component, please re-assign the bug 
to me so I can delete the old actions classes and the entries from plugin.xml
I've released the changes in org.eclipse.ui.ide.

Looks like you've already removed the action set and corresponding actions from
Update UI.

I notice that the actions now have icons, which weren't showing up in
I20040519-0010.  Are the icons new or were the paths invalid before?

I've also confirmed that Update UI is not getting activated eagerly when the IDE
starts up.

The icons had the wrong path. I received new icons from the graphics designers 
but forgot to correct the path inside plugin.xml.

I need to give Dejan a patch for the Intro, as he was using the install 
wizard, but you can version and release the code for tonight's M9 build.
Update UI still defines preference pages which an RCP app may not want to
appear, but we'll have to live with it.  See bug 63158.

Verified that we are calling the new API in 200405210010.  Nick, is there
anything else that needs to be verified?
No, it looks good, thanks.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I had an unreleased class in its own package.  I deleted the class from the 
packages explorer, and then deleted the package too.  I still have a bogus 
treeitem which appears in the package explorer.  Its icon is a square with a 
QUESTION mark.  The folder and resource no longer exist.

I'm using 0513 build.
After restarting eclipse, the "package" disappears.  I saved screenshot of it 
because I thought this would happen.  Let me know if you need it.  Nothing was 
in the log.
Randy, 

I tried to reproduce it using M9, but I think I am not using the correct 
steps. I did:

- project under version control
- created package p1
- created CU A.java
- deleted A.java
- deleted package p1

This works for me. We fixed two bugs in this area: one with filters and 
hierarchical layout and one with JFace viewer refreshes. 

Are you still seeing the bug under M9 ?
I have no idea how this bug occurred.  There was another bug I reported which 
may be related.  I refactor-&gt;renamed a class, and the old class name stayed 
around in the open-type dialog.  It sounds like these type of model refresh 
problems have been fixed.
We are aware of a bug (see bug 62854) which explains the type cache and update 
problem.

Since I can't reproduce the bug under M9 I wanted to know if you can still 
reproduce it. I didn't want to simply close the bug as a dup since I can not 
verify if it is one ;-).
You can close this.  If I reproduce, I'll reopen.
Resolved as works for me.</WithStack>

    <WithOutStack>To duplicate, do a Team &gt; Synchronize on some locally changed CVS project. In 
the Synchronize view, right click on a file and select Show in Resource 
History. That works ok, but then if you click on some other file in the 
Synchronize view and try to drag that into the CVS Resource History view, it 
won't drag. You also can't drag it into the editor window to edit it.

In the Navigator and Package Explorer view you can right click on a file and 
select Team &gt; Show in Resource History, and you can also click on any file and 
drag it into the CVS Resource History view or the editor area. One would 
expect it to work the same way in the Synchronize view.
Ack, not for 3.0 though :(

During shutdown, having the plug-in registry in the same folder as other view
that is showing up, I get the NPE below.

Steps:

1 - ensure the registry view is open, but hidden by another view stacked on top
of it
2 - shutdown
3 - start Eclipse again
4 - shutdown again - bug: error saving view

If the view is actually made visible between 3 and 4, the NPE does not happen.

    <WithStack>deactivate should only call eraseSizeOnDropFeedback if that feedback is 
actually being shown.  Look for similar approaches in other editpolicies.

Also, the use of null will be unexpected in clients.  I'm not sure what to do 
about that.
The convention (NonResizableEditPolicy, GraphicalNodeEditPolicy) seems to be to
hold onto the feedback figure, and in deactivate call removeFeedback() after a
null check. This is essentially what the erase... method does as well. So, in
this case we could do the same thing (the feedback is held onto in
LayoutEditPolicy, so we'd move the deactivate check to there). This also avoids
the problem regarding a bogus or null request.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>deactivate should only call eraseSizeOnDropFeedback if that feedback is 
actually being shown.  Look for similar approaches in other editpolicies.

Also, the use of null will be unexpected in clients.  I'm not sure what to do 
about that.
The convention (NonResizableEditPolicy, GraphicalNodeEditPolicy) seems to be to
hold onto the feedback figure, and in deactivate call removeFeedback() after a
null check. This is essentially what the erase... method does as well. So, in
this case we could do the same thing (the feedback is held onto in
LayoutEditPolicy, so we'd move the deactivate check to there). This also avoids
the problem regarding a bogus or null request.</WithOutStack>

Billy, I was not able to reproduce this. Does it happen every time? If so, 
could you show me how to get it? Thanks!
Same as Bug#57057.
Silenio, can you reassign this to UI?  There are areas of the UI code where it
assumes that widgets resized to have 0 width or 0 height cannot be visible.
*** Bug 64038 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Sorry for the dumb question, but there is no way to perform a setVisible(false) 
instead of setting the size of a window to 0? 
Done. This is still an issue in SWT, but there are other bug reports about it.
I talked to Silenio and Michael and we agreed this bug should be reassigned back
to Silenio (sorry!).  The cheeze problem should probably be solved in SWT.

Andrea, I think it's more complicated then that.  Changing the visibility rules
would be a dangerous change this close to 3.0 since other things may happen when
the widgets are hidden depending on the view, so a fix must be approached with
caution.  The fix in SWT would probably be to have some fake internal state
where the widget is invisible but still acts as if it is visible.
Billy, please bring this up again post 3.0.  Thanks.

    <WithStack>If you create a simple plugin project that has a bundle manifest file that has 
an Import-Package statement (and no Require-Bundle statements) then the plugin 
dependencies do not get setup correctly for the project.  Here are the steps 
to reproduce:

1.  Create a new plugin project
2.  Check the "Create an OSGi bundle manifest for the plug-in" box
3.  Uncheck the "Generate the Java class that controls the plug-in's ..." box
4.  Click Finish to create the project
5.  Once the project is created you can delete the plugin.xml from the

6.  Edit the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file for the project and add the following 
line:
Import-Package: org.osgi.framework

I would expect the org.eclipse.osgi plug-in to be added to the plug-in 
dependencies, but it is not.  You can demonstrate this by creating a class 
that implements the org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator class.  You will not be 
able to compile this class because the BundleActivator interface cannot be 
resolved.

Note that PDE build seems to handle this correctly.  If you attempt to export 
the plugin project it will get compiled correctly by PDE build.
I forgot to mention that I reproduced this on the I200405190010 build.

    <WithStack>Once I have some feature started that I am working on, it would be great to be 
able to navigate around and see only the changed files which I am working on. 
How about a working set which contains all outgoing resources?

This could also be a filter on top of whatever working set is currently 
selected.  That way I could quickly toggle it, and it could be used in 
conjunction with other working sets.  Or, it could be a working set which is a 
sub-type of the resource working set.

Another type of unrelated mix-in which might be useful would be anything with a 
compile error.  That way, if you touch a file and introduce a compile error, 
you could see both the outgoing change and the problems it would cause if 
released.
How about the following:
1. Create a synchronization for your entire workspace and switch it to outgoing
mode. 
2. The synchronize view shows error/warning markers now so you can see if you
are releasing compile errors.

But as far as using the existing working set mechanism to filter the
packages/navigator view, that would be more involved. One problem with filtering
existing views is that they don't support non-existing resources. We won't be
able to show outgoing deletions.
I don't want to see outgoing deletions.  I just want to see what I am currently 
working on (and any problems, in the case of errors), and outgoing changes is a 
rough approximation of this.  Using the synchronize view is similar, but it's 
not quite the same.
I agree that this feature would be useful but this is not the intended use of 
working sets. To use working sets for this would be clunky at best (i.e. 
working sets are not intended to be dynamic). Therefore, it would be better as 
a filter. Unfortunately, at the current time, their is no mechanism for 
defining general filters that apply to all views. To do this, we would need a 
mechanism similar to the popupMenu objectContribution for registering filters 
with the workbench. This may have been included as part of the generic 
resource navigaotr work. We should investigate post 3.0.
I have created a Package Explorer filter which does exactly what I want.  It 
works great.  In addition to outgoing changes, the filter also shows anything 
with Errors in it (so that you know if your changes affected other classes).  
The main problem is that this is a single "filter" which must recognize both 
compiler errors and outgoing changes.  You cannot create two filters and 
combine them additively.

Also, workbench does not expect Filters to dynamically change, so there is no 
dispose() method on filter. I hooked the Control's dispose event to remove 
listeners added by the filter.  Also, the filter doesn't know when it becomes 
disabled, so when any events are received it has to first check to see if it is 
enabled, and if not remove its listeners.

Filters are a "glass half empty" approach.  We need the opposite which I would 
call "providers".  I'm using "provider" as a UI term and not an implmentation 
term such as Label/ContentProvider.  When the packages view is populated, it 
would start with nothing, and allow providers to additively decide what should 
be viewed, and for filters to then decide what should get screened.  Then, I 
would enable the following providers separately:

1) Outoing CVS changes
2) Compile Errors
3) Unshared projects/resource (local stuff).</WithStack>

I don't have concrete steps to reproduce this (don't you just hate to see 
those words).  I was editting some java files (perspective.java being one of 
them).  I had done numerous change/compile/test cycles where testing usually 
involved firing up a self hosted Eclipse.  Then I tried to create a new plug-
in project.  An Error Log window popped up and notified me of these messages 
in the .log file.  However, it was much later than 15:21 when I created the 
plug-in project so I'm suspicious that something happened quietly earlier.  
Here's the .log file.  I'll add more information if I can reproduce this.

Can you remember deleting class Perspective?
I didn't delete that class but did overwrite it with the latest contents from 
HEAD.  I think I also replaced it with a previous version in my local history 
(but not 100% sure on that).


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 38341 ***</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I20040519
I don't have concrete steps to reproduce this (don't you just hate to see 
those words).  I was editting some java files (perspective.java being one of 
them).  I had done numerous change/compile/test cycles where testing usually 
involved firing up a self hosted Eclipse.  Then I tried to create a new plug-
in project.  An Error Log window popped up and notified me of these messages 
in the .log file.  However, it was much later than 15:21 when I created the 
plug-in project so I'm suspicious that something happened quietly earlier.  
Here's the .log file.  I'll add more information if I can reproduce this.

!MESSAGE Perspective [in [Working copy] Perspective.java [in 
org.eclipse.ui.internal [in Eclipse UI [in org.eclipse.ui.workbench]]]] does 
not exist.
Can you remember deleting class Perspective?
I didn't delete that class but did overwrite it with the latest contents from 
HEAD.  I think I also replaced it with a previous version in my local history 
(but not 100% sure on that).
