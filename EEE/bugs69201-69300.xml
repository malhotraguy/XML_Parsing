    <WithStack>Hi guys, 

  I found that if I try to assign some external folder to be a Java folder for 
my project and use functionality "Add Folder ..." in java build path tab of 
project's proprty dialog and after that click "Create New Folder ..." then I 
can see the button "Advanced" on the pop up dialog. If only I select some 
external folder and click again the button "Create New Folder ..." then the 
button "Advanced" is not shown. Of course it's not bif deal, just a liitle 
nuisance.

Cheers, Andrei
It always appears for me.  Can you describe more clearly the steps you used?
Billy, 

  The bug appears in 3.0.1 as well. You need to perform this sequence of 
actions to see it:
1. Choose a project 
2. Right click of project and select project's properties
3. Select "Java Build Path" in left navigation tree
4. Select "Source" tab in right pane
5. Click "Add Folder...". New dialog "Source Folder Selection" will appear
6. Click "Create New Folder". New dialog "New Folder" will appear 
with "Advanced &gt;&gt;&gt;" button
7. Enter some folder name and click "OK"
8. Repeat steps 5 - 7. Dialog "New Folder" will appear without "Advanced &gt;&gt;" 
button

Cheers, Andrei

    <WithStack>Hi,
I have this problem ever since I upgraded to Eclipse 3.0. The dialog boxes
(especially the delete confirmation) are sometimes ( 1 in 3) incorrect size. The
dialog box cuts off the text. 

I have an LFS 5.0 system running 2.6.5. 
Attached should be 2 images showing one good, and the other bad.

Delete Problem
Created attachment 12942
Good Image.
Just an update... I switched from XFCE 4.0.5 to the newest CVS (First of all..
it ROCKS).. Second.. Eclipse still isn't fixed... :(
Are you using the Motif or GTK version of Eclipse?  What other plugins do you 
have installed on top of the base Eclipse SDK?
Hi There,
I'm using GTK and the only other plugin I *recently* installed is the Tomcat
plugin. But it was still rendering sizes incorrectly before. 

Just to clarify a little bit, the problem isn't only with the delete dialog.
Almost all popup dialog get incorrectly sized @ one point or another. 

Saad. 
Is it an interaction with the window manager?
For some reason I think this problem is only with XFCE Window Manager. The
reason is because I got azureus (torrent client) and it also uses SWT and it
also sometimes incorrectly renders dialogs. 

I tried both of the applications in twm and there is no problem what so ever...
yet..


Saad.
I was investigating a similar issue with Enlightenment in bug 77267.  The
problem is likely that the GTK+ method gdk_window_get_frame_extents() is not
returning correct information under this window manager.
This problem should go away in 3.1RC3 and newer due to the fix for bug 99527. 
Can you test with this release?  If so I will mark this bug as a duplicate.
I'm convinced this is a duplicate.  Please re-open if you can reproduce with
eclipse 3.1.

another screenshot. it's much the same as the first one, tbh :)
I'm afraid I'm still seeing this on 3.1.1.

Things I've noticed which may or may not be relevant:

 - attempting to resize the dialog causes the dialog to move rather than resize
 - When this happens, the dialog always appears to open at the right width to make the title fit nicely.

For all I know, this may be an XFCE bug, but I've not seen it anywhere else.

I'm using xfce 4.2.2
Sorry, the case you're seeing is actually bug 100659 which is finally
(and this time for real) fixed for 3.2M4 and newer.

    <WithStack>Create a new empty visual class in the Java class which has the SWT library 
added.
Drop a Shell on to the canvas followed by a number of SWT components.
Bring up the Customize Layout dialog, and on the Row Options 'Fill', 'Pack' 
and 'Wrap' would be on by default (i.e True).
However, when Fill is the only option ON, it appears to perform no function - 
either with the row orientation is set to vertical or horizontal. 
But when Pack is true as well, some functionality can be then attributed to 
Fill.
This just makes the function of the option very unclear.
Jeff... please provide an explanation
According to the javadoc for Row Layout, pack specifies whether all components
should be given their default size.  Fill specifies that all controls should
have the same height/width (depending on the row orientation)  Fill isn't on by
default.

I just fooled with it a bit and it seems like if pack isn't specified, all the
components are given the largest size possible such that each component is the
same height and width.

I don't know if it's the role of these customization pages to explain the
functions provided by the various options on the layout.  Perhaps we could
include the javadoc explanation on the hover help in the next release.
Since this bug was not reOpened for more than a month, this bug is verified.

    <WithStack>The Middle-click diesn't seem to be used at all in eclipse 3.0.
For instance, It would be nice to be able to close an editor with a Middle-click
in the editor tab.
Do you mean on Windows XP?  Middle-click has a special meaning on Linux, and 
most Mac machines only have one mouse button. 
Yes on Windows. I forgot it had a special meaning on unixes, sorry.
I just thought of it when I tried to close an editor with a middle-click ( which
is the way I close tabbed browsers in Firefox). I really think it would be a nice
feature to have, it's a lot quicker to click anywhere on the tab to close an
editor than to point and click on the cross icon: it doesn't require as much
precision.
Changing Platform and OS to correspond with comment #1 and comment #2.  I'd 
recommend against doing this, as it doesn't seem to be native behaviour on 
Windows XP, and seems to require special functionality for Windows-only. 
 
What does Firefox do on Linux then? 
Firefox 0.8 on Linux does not seem to respond to middle-click on a tab.
... and neither does Firefox 0.9 on Linux.
This seems non-standard based on the comments following the original.  There are
however other options such as Ctrl+W from the keyboard.

I did not find any closeable tabs in bare Windows XP to determine whether that's
"standard" or not.

IMO, Eclipse should also support this useful feature (and offer a preference for
those who don't like it). Let's follow the path of other successful "tabbed
browsing" applications!

&gt; 
&gt; I did not find any closeable tabs in bare Windows XP to determine whether that's

Now it has become standard even in IE7 (in addition to Firefox, Opera, ...).
I would also very much like to see this feature implemented for the Windows version of Eclipse, as I find myself automatically trying to middle-click close tabs in eclipse. I believe the feature is standard in a lot of programs with tabs, the Trillian chat program comes to mind, in addition to the already mentioned Firefox, IE7, and Opera web browsers.

I have just discoverred there is actually already a plugin which does this, but I think it is something which deserves to be done natively within eclipse.

For anyone that wants to get the plugin for this, it can be found here: http://www.hlsoft.com/clickclosestab_eclipse
Looks like this has been implemented for I20071127-0800.

Yes indeed.  Btw, I didn't realize that Firefox (2.0) on Linux does not support middle-click-closing of tabs.  It behaves strangely - some kind of paste operation to the URL field seems to be going on.

If middle-click-closing of tabs in Eclipse bothers Linux people, we should discuss this again.

About the Mac - yes, most Macs only have one mouse button, so I don't think this feature would hurt them. ;-)

While 'Margin Left', and 'Margin Top' do the same function as 'Margin Height' 
and 'Margin Width'.
The reason it appears they don't do anything is because you had a fixed size
shell. Since the size of the shell was fixed you couldn't tell that anything was
happening on the right/bottom.

If instead you did a set size to default on the shell, then the shell will
resize itself to preferred sizes. Then when you did a margin left, you will see
that the margin on the left grows while the margin on the right stays the same.
If you did margin right, then it will grow on the right while the left would
stay the same. If you did margin width then both sides would grow. The same
happens with bottom and height.

    <WithOutStack>Create an empty visual class in a java project that has the SWT libraries added.
Drop a Shell on to the empty canvas and size it appropriatly. And set it to 
Rowlayout.
Then drop an number of SWT widgets on to the Shell amd then set text to the 
components that can take text.
Bring up the Customize layout dialog, and play aound with the 'Spacing' 
controls, or change these in the Properties view or in the Source.

Here, it is really unclear as to what is the functionality of 'Margin 
Bottom', 'Margin Left', 'Margin Right' and 'Margin Top'?

    <WithStack>Hello,
I use Eclipse 3.0 and It seems there are some pbs with .class generation (maybe
;-) ) . On several projects , it seems that when I change a .java file, the
corresponding .class file is not updated/recreated. I've tried "automatic
build", "Build all", "build project"...without success :-( the .class files are
not regenerated... What I 've missed? So I'm not confident anymore in my .class
file :-(
best regards
Xavier
Could you please provide a test case to reproduce?
Add CC'
Please reopen once steps to reproduce are available.
Hello,
I've found the reason of the prbs I encountered. It  was due to the Sysedo
Tomcat plugin. The solution was described by rudolf :
" Problem with Eclipse 3/Sysdeo Tomcat Launcher ("Required library cannot denote
external folder...."):
Open project properties --&gt; Java Build Path --&gt; Libraries and remove
'TOMCAT_HOME' (it's marked with a small, yellow warning sign), because this is
not a java library.
Eclipse 2.12 displays the same warning but ignores the not existing library.
Rudolf"
I don't know if there is something to do in eclipse (maybe have the former
behavior as in 2.1 ?)...
best regards

On reopening, the build.xml was wrongly flagged in error due to a "missing
default compile target", that was simply not true.
The only way to remove the error flag was to close the build.xml editor, close
eclipse, reopen eclipse and edit again build.xml.
As soon as the editor reopened, the error flag disappeared.

The commit was completed since about five minutes when i closed eclipse, so
there was no concurrence between it and the closing.
It is a one time occurrence, and i have not been able to reproduce it again.
Was the Ant editor you made the change in the only Ant editor that was open?
No it wasn't. I had another ant editor opened with a build.xml from another
project, an xml file opened with XMLBuddy and some java editors, may be 5/6, i
don't remember the exact number.
Just to prevent your question, XMLBuddy is still the version 2.0.8 and not the
2.0.10 that is unusable since it breaks the ant editor.
Gabriele I have not seen or been able to reproduce this problem. 
Have you seen it at all recently?
Hi Darin,
it was easily reproduceable, at least for me, with 3.0.0, but i didn't saw it
anymore since going to 3.0.1 and then to 3.1.0.
My be it was an induced problem and that somehow it was solved on the way to
3.0.1, so if you agree, i think we can close the bug, so you can shorten your
list by one :)

Thanks,  Gabriele.
Thank you for reporting back.

Whatever name I choose for the new workspace I get the error :
"Workspace is in use, choose a different one"

Even if i enter a workspace directory that doesn't exist, I get the error.
After the error message I can see that the directory that I specified was
created along with its .metadata subdir and inside the .metadata dir, there was
a .lock file. If I delete that lock file I still get the same error.

The eclipse installation is on /tmp/eclipse because I don't have access to 
other directories on the local hard disk and I don't want it to run from the
network.

If I set the workspace to be on /tmp, it works without a glitch. If I choose a
workspace directory on the network, I get the error described above, and this
even if I chmod the workspace dir to 777.
not sure why this ended up in the Intro bucket.

created along with its .metadata subdir and inside the .metadata dir, there was
a .lock file. If I delete that lock file I still get the same error.

The eclipse installation is on /tmp/eclipse because I don't have access to 
other directories on the local hard disk and I don't want it to run from the
network.

If I set the workspace to be on /tmp, it works without a glitch. If I choose a
workspace directory on the network, I get the error described above, and this
even if I chmod the workspace dir to 777.
not sure why this ended up in the Intro bucket.

    <WithStack>The outliner (silently) leaves off certain valid C functions because they
contain C++ keywords. I guess they break the outliners parser but its still
annoying.

Although I observed to problem is a complex program the following, very simple,
example demonstrates the problem. The function will not be displayed in the
outline view because it uses the C++ reserved word 'this' as the name of its
argument.

static int breakTheOutliner(int this) {
	return this + 1;
}
Is the containing project a C or C++ project? 
What type of file (.h, .C, .cc etc.) contains this declaration?
This problem manifested itself on a 'Standard C Make', the source file ended .c
and I was using Eclipse 3.0 RC3 with CDT 2.0 M9.

The problem no longer manifests itself using the overnight builds (I tested CDT
2.0 I20040628).

Note that there were severe problems storing settings for this type of project
in M9 (see bug 69147). I think it possible that this bug was, in fact, another
manifestation of that problem.
Using the 2.0 release, I created a new Standard C make project with a file 
named t.c, and the given code works fine in the outline view.

The problem would be explained by the project telling the parser the wrong 
language for the file, which now seems to be working.</WithStack>

To reproduce, I right click on the project and select Refresh just to make 
sure everything is in sync (this is optional). Then I edit one .c file in my 
project and save it. Then I do a Search &gt; File and type in the name of some 
string that appears in this and other files. (Note this is the regular file 
search and not the C++ search since C++ search doesn't work for me.) When I 
hit return, I get a dialog that says "Problems encountered during text search" 
with the detail info of "Resource is out of sync with the file system" and 
listing the file I just edited. I'm positive that there is no other process 
besides Eclipse modifying these files. I do not have the Refresh workspace 
automatically option turned on.

It doesn't happen every time. For example as I was writing this it was 
happening ever time. Then I closed the editor and reopened it on the same .c 
file and it would not happen at all. There are many previous errors in the 
log. Here's the tail end of the log including one error about 10 minutes 
previous to the sync error:

    <WithStack>hi,
I am using Eclipse 3.0 on a Windows XP box. When I run a junit test, and the DB
access throws an exception in either the setUp() or tearDown() methods, the test
run just stops without printing out a stack trace. When I debug, and put in a
try-catch block around the offending line of code, I can see what the exception
is. But shouldnt the stack trace be available in the console normally?

Please advice on how this can be corrected if its a user error.
Move to JDT/UI
Erich, can you please comment.
I assume this is a subclass of TestSetup?
If it is then this is a duplicate of bug# 35590 which got fixed for M2.
If it isn't then please reopen the bug with more details for how to reproduce
the problem.

    <WithStack>After some time editing/saving a Java source file with line numbering turned 
on, the ruler becomes "pink", as if all the lines of the file were changed. 
Such behavior seems to appear after version 3.0, because in RC3 it didn't occur.

System configuration is Windows 2000 SP4, with all MS patches until this date 
(but no patch applied since RC3).
Steps to reproduce:

. Open a .java file with more lines than the screen height
. Go to the last line on the screen (not on the file)
. Press ENTER

This will happen when there are too many differences between the document in the
editor and the reference document (e.g. cvs), so that the diff information
cannot be computed using a sane amount of memory. I don't see this when changing
just one single line.

This was introduced late in 3.0 to guard against high memory consumption. 

Works as expected, please reopen if you see this when there is only one single
difference.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>This is a little complex, sorry if the explanation seems incoherent.

WorkbenchPartLabelProvider can be made to generate a NullPointerException if 
someone creates a new IEditorInput and returns null from the getToolTipText 
function.  

The NullPointerException occurs when you try to close Eclipse with dirty editor
(s) whose IEditorInput return null from getToolTipText.  The reason appears to 
be because the workbench tries to compile a list of editors to query the 
user "Should I save these before exit".  When the workbench does this, it's 
LabelProvider.getText function makes the assumption (probably the real bug) 
that getToolTipText on every EditorPart never returns null.  This can result 
because the default implementation of EditorPart uses 
IEditorInput.getToolTipText.

My suggestion is either:

1) specify that getToolTipText on IEditorInput should _never_ return null.
2) OR (better), protect the call in WorkbenchLabelProvider.getText so that if 
an EditorPart.getToolTipText returns null, it just returns some default value.
I think this issue has been resolved.  Stefan?
IEditorInput has never been allowed to return null from getToolTipText.
LabelProvider's assumption is fine. More explicit javadoc has been added, and a
null check has been added to the part conformance test. 

If the workbench detects that an editor input is returning null from
getToolTipText, it will now refuse to create that editor and substitute an error
part instead.

    <WithStack>Hi,
We have already deployed plugin written against the eclipse version 2.x. Our 
plugin has a dependency on the xerces plugin which was part of the installed 
plugins in eclipse 2.x and upto 3.0M8. In eclipse RC3 the xerces plugin has 
being removed from the plugins installed with eclipse. So when we try to 
install and load our pluign into 3.0RC3 it does not load. I ran eclipse with 
the -console option and in the OSGI console i found out that the reason for the 
failure was indeed the missing xerces plugin from 3.0RC3.
 
I know that in 3.0 we are supposed to use the xerces passer from the jdk, but 
this does not solve the situation where you already have deployed 2.x plugins 
with the xerces plugin in there dependency list. Please let me know what needs 
to be done to make my 2.x plugin work in 3.0rc3.

Thanks in Advance
Anthony Candappa
You can either patch the existing plug-ins by removing the dependency on Xerces
(I believe you don't have any explicit dependency on Xerces other than the
plug-in prerequisite), or provide an empty Xerces plug-in (just a placeholder)
to your users.
Hi Rafael,
We have an explicit dependency on the xerces plugin. We have imports for 
import org.apache.xerces.dom.DocumentImpl;
import org.apache.xerces.parsers.DOMParser;

and if we put the stub for the xerces plugin like you are suggesting, the 
plugin loads fine, but when we initiate any operation that uses the xerces 
plugin we get a NoClassDefFound exception. 

I know we can patch our install and compile it to be 3.0 compatible, but we 
have several clients with the old 2.x binaries that might want to move to 
eclipse 3.0 before we ship another version/patch, and the current 2.x binary of 
our plugin will not work out of the box with eclipse 3.0.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks in Advance,
Anthony Candappa

    <WithStack>Hello, I sometimes (often?) get this error message:

C/C++ File Editor

Source not found
Can not find the file 'C:\full\path\to\source.cpp' in the specified source 
locations.
You can attach a new source location by pressing the button below.

[Attach Source...]

However, the file 'C:\full\path\to\source.cpp' actually does exist. If I 
click 'Attach Source', and cut and paste the path, ''C:\full\path\to\' into 
the 'add directory' entry, the editor is able to load the file.

It seems to me the editor can't detect that the file name is an absolute path 
and load it, rather it assumes the full path is simply relative.

This is with Eclipse 3.0 and CDT RC2.
This is an expected behavior. The debugger only looks for files in the source 
locations specified in the launch configuration. Even if the absolute path is 
provided the source location should be added to the list. 
This seems counter-intutitive for non-managed projects. IE, for projects that have Makefiles not 
handled by Eclipse, why should the user have to duplicate all sorts of source path entries in the eclipse 
configuration when its already provided to the debugger explicitly?

If a full path is provided, why can't the Eclipse automatically add the path to launch configuration? It 
seems strange for Eclipse to say "I can't find this file, which is staring me right in the face".

As a last comment, if this is by design and expected behavior, how about enhancing the error message 
to explain that? Could the error message say "File located, but path must be in launch configuration"?
I agree, it is not intuitive. The source location list is also used to filter 
breakpoints that do not belong to the project.
Anyway, the implementation of the source lookup will be changed to adjust it to 
the new approach used by the Eclipse platform. And this comment will be taken 
in account.
For the next release I will modify the message. 
Oh, perhaps that explains why some of my breakpoints were not being fired. Anyway, thank you for 
taking this into consideration.
Fixed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If you Export your Eclipse Preferences on one workstation and then Import them 
on another, any pre-existing classpath variable values on the second 
workstation will be overwritten with the newly-imported values.  This includes 
Reserved variables such as JRE_LIB, which cannot be subsequently corrected by 
the user (hence the Major severity of this bug).

I think the way this should work is that variables which already exist on the 
importing workstation should not be overwritten.  Variables which don't already 
exist may be created, which will give the user a cue that s/he can subsequently 
alter them (their values will probably be different between workstations).  At 
the very least, the Import should ask what to do, but NEVER overwrite Reserved 
variables.
If you still have a backup of a V2 Eclipse workspace, you can work around the 
loss of variables values by copying the 
old ...\workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.core\pref_store.ini file 
to the corresponding V3 workspace directory and restarting Eclipse.
Plug-in preference values are cleared at the destination when importing. This is
designed behaviour. Part of the motivation is that a user who exports
preferences from one machine and then imports them on another machine will have
exactly the same preferences on the same machine.

Moving to JDT/Core for comment w.r.t. the handling of reserved classpath
variables like JRE_LIB.
Yes, but there are important differences between IDE preferences and Project
environment setups.  In this case, it's highly likely that paths will be
different between workstations, so the variables should not be blindly cleared
and/or overwritten.  -This is why the user has factored out the class paths to
environment variables in the first place.  Changing the variable values will
almost certainly break the project.  As it is now, the net effect of the current
behavior is that IDE settings cannot be exchanged between co-workers, or even
the same person between workstations.
Another way to work around this problem (if you know ahead of time), is to
remove the variable definition lines from the exported preferences file before
importing it on the second workstation.
JRE_LIB is reserved by JDT UI. 
Moving to JDT UI for comment.
Some additional comments:

- the new export story we define for 3.0 will allow controlling which settings
  get exported and which don't. So it will be the responibility of the export
  to handle this, not the import. As DJ pointed out importing always means
  importing everything.

The value of the JRE_LIB variable can be controlled via the preference page
"Installed JREs". By selecting a different JRE and reselecting the one you want
should be a better workaround.

Moving to Debug since they own the variable.


In M5, it is possible to specify groups of prefs when exporting/importing 
preferences. However, looking at the support in 
org.eclispe.ui.preferenceTransfer (extension), you can only specify groups of 
prefs to selectively export/import, or export/import all. This does not quite 
allow us to fix this problem - i.e. the user want to say export everything 
except these things (like JRE_LIB, installed JREs, etc). The UI does not allow 
this in its current state.

It's not clear if the preferences should never be exported/imported, of if the 
user should have a chance to export/import them. When exporting the prefs to 
use on a different workstation, it does not make sense to keep them (as 
installation locations will likely be different). However, there are cases 
where it makes sense to keep them (when setting up a new workspace on the same 
machine).

It feels like validating a preference on import and rejecting it if invalid 
could be useful.
Yes, regarding your last comment, I believe that using preferenceTransfer in
combination with the preference apply intercepter should give you what you need
(see bug 88322).
This support from core will allow one to make changes to their preferences
before they get applied (most cases through import but not always).  In your
case you can wipe out the jre if you feel that should be done.  

On export if "Export all" where chosen you have no option to stop this, but you
could re-org preferences slightly or design a preferenceTransfer to export
various preference and not include the node that has the jre if that were
appropriate.
Fixed. Added an org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences extension to 
jdt.launching. Our modify listener merges JREs being imported into the 
existing JRE settings. Invalid JREs are discarded.

    <WithStack>Occasionally, when I merge code from and earlier release of my Java project 
(we use multiple branches in CVS), the comparison window shows conflicts (in 
red) for large parts of the file (often the entire file). This happens even if 
there is a single line change between the file.

When I use a 3rd party tool (ex: WinMerge) it correctly shows the minimal 
difference.

The problem is not predictable but is reproducible once it happens (that is, I 
get the same results each time I attempt to merge the same file using an 
earlier release).

In some instances when I visually pick out the actual differences and manually 
make the changes and save the updated file, the red-marked diffs go away.

This problem has been observed since release 2 of eclipse and is still there 
in release 3.
This can occur if the (invisible) line-separators differ.
Often this is a result of sharing files between Windows and Unix and don't have the files checked into 
CVS correctly marked as "text". You can fix the line delimiters in the Eclipse editor with "Convert Line 
Delimiters to.." and you can fix the incorrect CVS attribute via "Team &gt; Change ASCII/Binary property".

In addition, you can turn the "Ignore Whitespace" option on for Compare.

Let me know if this fixes the problem.
An additional observation:

When a chunk of code shows up as red (conflicting changes), I can sometimes 
visually locate the one line or two out of the entire range of lines marked in 
red. I can then copy and paste them into the merged-into file and save it. The 
red markings then go away.

Somehow, rather than just show the few lines that have changed (from an earlier 
branch), an entire range of lines (often the entire file) shows up as 
conflicting changes.
We can't really do anything to fix this unless we can reprodice the problem. Could you attach the 2 or three file copies involved so we can try and reproduce this?

Depends on what you want to do, the solution is : create only one object, set

    <WithStack>Turning DEBUG logging on in the RAC sometimes causes RAC crashes.  It happens 
when printing out the environment variables in modifyApplicationEnvironment in

ra_logServiceMessage in RAServerConfigBinding.cpp uses fprintf(_logFile, 
_preBuffer) to print out the log message to the file.  But if the log message 
in _preBuffer contains % followed by a valid type specifier character (eg. %l 
or %n), that two character substring will not appear in the log message and 
sometimes causes fprintf to blow up.  I have only noticed this on windows

I suggest to replace fprintf with fwrite.  For example:

fwrite(_preBuffer, 1, strlen(_preBuffer), _logFile)

    <WithStack>Toolbars and tabs are too fat on GTK Linux compared to Windows, leaving too few
space for the editor. Toolbars has unused space above and below buttons, while
tabs has lot of unused space above and below text. I tried different themes, but
it makes no difference.
This is a common observation that bugged me so I did some research.

Toolbar buttons in GTK+ are normal GTK+ buttons.  The border around their
contents consists of the following:

1. GtkWidget border (usually set to 0 by the theme)
2. A hard-coded 1 pixel spacer (not overridable)
3. GtkWidget "thickness", used for the button shadow (usually 2 pixels)
4. Space for the dotted focus line (1 pixel) and some padding (usually 1 pixel)

This usually creates a 5 pixel border at every edge of the button.  Comparing
with Eclipse on Windows XP I see:

1. The button shadow is 1 pixel instead of 2 pixels
2. Toolbar buttons appear raised instead of having a dotted focus border
3. There is a 2-pixel padding around each icon before the button shadow

This gives a total of 3 pixels of border, except for the top and right hand
sides which have an extra padding pixel for a total of 4 pixels.

So the difference is usually 3 pixels in height.  The shadows could be made
thinner by the theme, and the focus padding can also be removed.  It seems that
most GTK+ themes like big buttons, but through google I found a theme called
"Smooth-Professional" that removes the focus padding.
Billy what do you want to do with this bug then?
Close as WONTFIX, we should not override GTK+'s behaviour on this.
 Closing, thank you for taking the time to log this however.  Please confirm 
that you agree with comment #1 as well.
OK, I will submit big toolbars bug to Gtk theme, but what about tabs? &gt;it&lt; is
the main problem. In CDT I have opened editor windows (have tabs) and
console/problems (also have tabs). It means that inapropriate size of tabs (in
height) is multiplyed by 2. In Windows, tabs are cca 3/5 size of Gtk's.
The tabs are made to be tall enough that the toolbar can fit up on the tab area.
 Does this match what you are seeing?
Yes, It fits tab area in both cases. Does it mean tab area in gtk is too big,
and you cannot make it smaller in eclipse itself? Same case as toolbar?
One more note, I looked to Gtk "Notepad" widget at:
http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/sec-notebooks.html

and it looks ok (not over-sized in height at all).
I just mean that Eclipse sets the size of the tabs to be "big enough to fit a
toolbar", since otherwise you would have some tabs taller than others depending
on whether or not they have a toolbar in the tab area and it would not be
visually consistent.
If you look at the tabs in gedit which include a close button (also a GtkButton)
in their tab, they are the same size as the tabs in Eclipse.
I finally get it. I can see that package explorer tab, for example, has
additional toolbar. I suggest improving Preferencies -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Editor Tab
Positions, by adding "None" option to existing "Top" and "Bottom".
Are you saying you don't want there to be Editor/View tabs at all?  
You can also try adding these lines in your gtkrc file or the gtkrc file for
your theme:

  GtkWidget::focus-line-width = 0
  GtkWidget::focus-padding = 0

This works for me to get thin tabs.
OK, this gtkrc tweak works, and it now looks on my Gnome Desktop same/better
then Windows. One of problems was also I was running it from KDE. I don't know
why, but under gnome it looks so much better (Gtk application should look
exactly the same). Anyway, for both Windows/Linux it would be usefull to be able
to disable editor tabs: it is almost useless. You can open files on the left
navigator view, you can see current file opened in main application window
title. KDevelop also has tabs optional, MSVS 6 has no tabs at all, i think. In
low res like 1024x768 it really makes difference. I would even disable it by
default. Please consider this enhancement and, eventually rename this bug (and
mark it as enhancement, not bug).

    <WithStack>Eclipse has always has a small problem in that occaisionally it would show an
error in the editor window (red-squiggly, with a marker) even though the error
had been fixed and no longer appeared in the Tasks/Problem view. I usually just
type "Space-Backspace" and save the file and it goes away.

In 3.0, this is MUCH more frequent.  I'm not 100% sure of the cause, but every
time I've seen in it recently, file A will have a problem, and then I'll change
file B to fix it.  I'll pay more attention, and see if I can obtain any more
details.
I assume you run plain Eclipse SDK without additional plug-ins and open a *.java
file with the Java editor, right?

Is the file big? If so, it can take a while until reconcile thread has done it's
work.

If you see this problem again please check whether there's anything in .log.

Yes to all your assumptions.  The files are not particuarly big (a few hundred
lines at most).  I don't think it's a timing issue, but I'll be glad to
double-check the "progress view" if thw will help to verify.

I'll check the .log.

I saw the problem again today, but there was nothing in the log.  I'm not sure 
(unfortunately) exactly what I did/or the class relationships. 
	 
Did you refresh that file from local file system?
Is the file open in multiple workbench windows?
*** Bug 69449 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I found a bug in that area and fixed it:
- have more than one editor open (say A.java and B.java which refer to each other)
- change A so that B has an error (don't save)
- switch to B ==&gt; error is shown
- switch back to A

- give focus to another application
- give focus back to Eclipse
- switch to B ==&gt; error still shown</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Eclipse has always has a small problem in that occaisionally it would show an
error in the editor window (red-squiggly, with a marker) even though the error
had been fixed and no longer appeared in the Tasks/Problem view. I usually just
type "Space-Backspace" and save the file and it goes away.

In 3.0, this is MUCH more frequent.  I'm not 100% sure of the cause, but every
time I've seen in it recently, file A will have a problem, and then I'll change
file B to fix it.  I'll pay more attention, and see if I can obtain any more
details.
I assume you run plain Eclipse SDK without additional plug-ins and open a *.java
file with the Java editor, right?

Is the file big? If so, it can take a while until reconcile thread has done it's
work.

If you see this problem again please check whether there's anything in .log.

Yes to all your assumptions.  The files are not particuarly big (a few hundred
lines at most).  I don't think it's a timing issue, but I'll be glad to
double-check the "progress view" if thw will help to verify.

I'll check the .log.

I saw the problem again today, but there was nothing in the log.  I'm not sure 
(unfortunately) exactly what I did/or the class relationships. 
	 
Did you refresh that file from local file system?
Is the file open in multiple workbench windows?
*** Bug 69449 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I found a bug in that area and fixed it:
- have more than one editor open (say A.java and B.java which refer to each other)
- change A so that B has an error (don't save)
- switch to B ==&gt; error is shown
- switch back to A
- fix error (don't save)
- give focus to another application
- give focus back to Eclipse
- switch to B ==&gt; error still shown</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Sometimes, when I do a "Change Signature" refactoring, an import that WAS in the
source file, is removed.  I don't know that it's relevant, but the one place
I've seen it for sure, the lost import was ONLY referenced in a call to a
constructor.

Something like this:


public Foo() {
  this(new Bar());
}
public Foo(IBar bar) {
  this.bar = bar; 
}

If I use "Change Signature" to add an additional parameter to the second
constructor, the import for Bar disappeared.

Using build 3.0RC3 Sat, 19 Jun 2004 -- 20:00 (-0400)
What version of OS and Java VM are you using?
Have you tried the final version of Eclipse 3.0?

You can find instructions for how to launch Eclipse on MacOS X from the command line in 
"readme/readme_eclipse.html".

Using Version 10.3.4, java version "1.4.2_01"
The final version of eclipse 3.0 behaves the same way. However all versions work fine on my desktop 
iMac and my desktop g4 with which has the same os and java version. They all fail on my G4 laptop. 
Since I'm running Eclipse on my G4 laptop without problems,  I suspect that there is 
something wrong with your laptop.

Is there any (Eclipse related) output in the MacOS X Console when you double click 
Eclipse?

What exact version of the JVM are you using (execeute a "java -version" in a shell to get 
the version information). On my PowerBook I get:

java version "1.4.2_04"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_04-135)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-36, mixed mode)

My laptop had the following java version for which eclipse failed:
java version "1.4.2_01"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_01-107)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-001-31, mixed mode)

I copied the java that is on my imac to my laptop and now eclipse works fine. 
java version "1.4.2_03"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_03-117.1)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-34, mixed mode)


I don't think that there was a general problem with Eclipse and the version of the Java VM you were 
using (build 1.4.2_01-107).
It was probably a broken installation that got corrected by installing a more recent version on 
top of it.
Please reopen this bug if problem reoccurs.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In some cases the substituted keywords, notably the $Id$-keyword, will exceed
the maximum line width. In this cases the formatter will add a line break which
inhibits CVS from recognizing the keyword.
That means every CVS keyword (in the edited files) has to be checked manually
prior to commiting.

Please add an option to exclude CVS keywords from formatting.

An even better option would be the ability to exclude lines that match a given
pattern.
Those keywords are in the header, right. You can set the formatter not to format
headers. Please reopen if this does not work for you.

Also note that if your header comment starts with
/*-
 *
it will not get formatted by Eclipse and most likely not by any other tool since
this sort of a Java convention.


See also bug 68593.
Those keywords are in the type's Javadoc comment, more precisely after the
@version tag. AFAIK there is no way to exclude a single Javadoc comment from
being formatted except to disable the comment formatting totally which effects
all other comments as well.

So I would like to see a possibility to tell the code formatter not to touch
certain lines (or more general parts of the code) that mach a configurable list
of patterns. I guess that would be really helpfull, for both code and comments.

I'll reopen this bug and set the severity to enhancement.

Couldn't you put it into the header? What do you do if you have &gt;1 type in a file?
Each type has it's own file. Except for some (anonymous) inner classes. For
these it is fine to get the same version id as the enclosing type.

    <WithStack>Eclipse 3.0 w/ Motif GUI seems very unstable. It crashes very quickly. For 
example, the sequence
Window--&gt;Show view--&gt;Navigator
and then 
right click on a project--&gt;Close Project crashes the software every time.
The resulting dialog box says: "JVM terminated. Exit code=6." and then lists the 
arguments that were used in starting the vm.

I have tried this with j2sdk1.4.2_04 and _05 with the same results.

I am using SuSE Linux 8.0. I will gladly provide more information if needed.
Move to Platform/UI
Which version of 3.0 are you using?  Is there anything in the .log file?  What 
non-Eclipse plugins do you have installed?
Which window manager are you using?  Are you using the SUSE 8.0 out-of-the-

I would expect that you are using KDE 3.0 and a linux kernel 2.4.18.
  I am using SuSE 8.0 pretty much out of the package. I have upgraded as
much as the automatic update with YaST Control Center does update. I think
I have updated some additional packages here and there, I can't remember
for sure which ones though.

  I'm using the default window manager for KDE which seems to be sawfish.
karanta@hyperion:~&gt; rpm -q sawfish
sawfish-1.0.1-87

  KDE is version 3.0.5 and:

akaranta@hyperion:~&gt; uname -a
Linux hyperion 2.4.18-4GB #1 Wed Mar 27 13:57:05 UTC 2002 i686 unknown


KDE uses the kwin window manager.  GNOME can use many different window 
managers, of which Sawfish is one.  When you log-in, what "session type" do you 
choose? 
 
Can you attach a screenshot of Eclipse immediately after it has started?

A screenshot of Eclipse 3.0 right after it has started
Ok, I attached the screenshot.

When I log in, I choose KDE as session type. 

I haven't changed my window manager. I assumed I am using sawfish, as when I 
open
SuSE Menu --&gt; System --&gt; WM --&gt; Window Manager
I get a window titled "Control Center" opened under Desktop --&gt; Window Manager 
and on the right it has the following list with the word current in brackets 
after sawfish:

Sawfish (current)
twm
Window Maker

But now that I looked closer, it seems to be the Gnome Control Center. Sorry, my 
mistake...


This is definitely Motif, and it seems from the user has said that they are 
using KDE/kwin. 
 
Could you please the hs_err_pid*.log files from the crashes?  These will likely 
be located in the Eclipse installation directory itself, but might be in your

Doing something like "find ~ -name 'hs_err_pid*.log'" might help you find them.

    <WithOutStack>Eclipse 3.0 w/ Motif GUI seems very unstable. It crashes very quickly. For 
example, the sequence
Window--&gt;Show view--&gt;Navigator
and then 
right click on a project--&gt;Close Project crashes the software every time.
The resulting dialog box says: "JVM terminated. Exit code=6." and then lists the 
arguments that were used in starting the vm.

I have tried this with j2sdk1.4.2_04 and _05 with the same results.

I am using SuSE Linux 8.0. I will gladly provide more information if needed.
Move to Platform/UI
Which version of 3.0 are you using?  Is there anything in the .log file?  What 
non-Eclipse plugins do you have installed?
Which window manager are you using?  Are you using the SUSE 8.0 out-of-the-
box, or have you upgraded certain packages?

    <WithStack>Request a feature so that you can filter the consoles output to lines 
containing a specific phrase. This is useful for debugging when there is a lot 
of output.

Many times developers prefix a specific output line, e.g. "LASTNAME: Smith"

So if you could filter for "LASTNAME:" would be great.

But often you need to see just more than one particular phrase, because data 
is related to each other. So the filter ability should be able to filter to 
lines containing any of a list of Strings.

e.g. filter for "LASTNAME:" and "FIRSTNAME:"
Also, should be able to save these Filter sets for reuse later.

It is often that one is interesting in breaking on an exception after having 
obtained a stack trace. It would be thus interesting to be able to capture 
some of the exception context (from trace) and be able to break on this very 
occurrence. e.g. NullPointerExceptions may occur in quite numerous places, and 
be a pain to track when only interested by its occurrence in a specific 
context.
Note that you can currently scope an exception breakpoint to a class or 
package (or pattern). We do not allow scoping to a method (yet). See 
the "Filters" page on the exception breakpoint properties.
It would be interesting though to automate the definition of appropriate 
filters based on a given stack trace (in the same way as you provide quick 
navigation on these).

createBaselineParagraph which is supposed to render a number of
string fragments (incrementally growing in font size) aligned to a
common baseline, doesn't. It produces an uneven, ragged baseline.

The baseline becomes offset, by 2 or 3 pixels above the baseline, whilst
changing the font size fragments between 10 and 11pts, before the word "have".

There are also other funnies with baseline alignment exhibited in the 
TextFlowExample, namely when changing font or font style within a BlockFlow.
Fixed.  We removed the font leading at some point and now I've put it back in.  
For some fonts such as the default windows font leading is 0, but for bold or 
larger fonts leading starts to have an effect.

The result is that TextFragment.getAscent() actually represents the entire area 
above the baseline, including "leading".  So it's a slightly different 
definition than ascent in FontMetrics.</WithStack>

First issue is due to an extra check for wildcards in invocation, which is no 
longer necessary once bug 69141 got addressed.
The second scenario feels like it should be allowed, as a raw type is always 
compatible with a parameterized type. 

So Map&lt;String,Class&gt; should be assignable to Map&lt;String,Class&lt;? extends 
Object&gt;&gt;.

The following testcase demonstrates this behavior:
public class X {
  class MX&lt;E&gt; {

      void foo(E e) {}

    <WithStack>Many programmers like editing a program with monospace font.
Many programmers like syntax highliting with bold.
However, many monospace fonts have a problems that width of bold gryph is not
same as regular, like MS Gothic in Windows.
Force monospace feature corrects this problem, in  draw time.
I believe that force monospace feature increase user experience.

Principle is simple, if font style of run is not regular,
recalculate position and width of each gryph with regular style, 
and set these position and width to the run.

It is very easy to implement force monospace feature in win32.
You may implement force monospace feature in gtk and carbon, but it is not so

Maybe, it is difficult to implement in motif and emulate(photon), 
because these platform do not have the way to operate the gryph position and width.

monospace font checker. (for J2SE 5.0)

Execute this program, then you will see the output like following.

&gt; monospc | font family name
&gt; --------+------------------
&gt;  not	  | Arial
&gt;  not	  | Arial Black
&gt;  not	  | Batang
&gt;  pseudo | BatangChe
&gt;  not	  | Bitstream Vera Sans
&gt;  true   | Bitstream Vera Sans Mono

"not" intends that it is not monospace font.
"true" intends that it is monospace font and regular width equals bold width.
"pseudo" intends that it is monospace font, however regular width does not
equal bold width.

you can execute this program with encoding names,
then you will see the output like following.

&gt; C:&gt;java MonospaceTest ASCII

This file is output of "java MonospaceTest ASCII JIS BIG5 EUCCN EUCKR" on  my
WindowsXP. It is clearly that WindowsXP has no "true monospace font" which can
use with CJK characters.

If eclipse does not support this force monospace feature, 
1. Seek "true monospace font" at start,
   This solution increases initial cost of Eclipse.
2. Use "Courier New", and do not use their native language.
   This solution decreases user experience.
3. Use "pseudo monospace font", and do not highlight with bold. 
   This solution decreases user experience.
4. Throw away monospace layout.
   This solution decreases user experience.

SSQ and FH to discuss this with SN.  If I read the patches properly, we are 
ignoring then operating system spacing for bold fonts and hammering them to be 
the same as regular fonts?  Although it makes Eclipse look nice, it doesn't 
seem right to do this.

Michel, why don't you just turn bold fonts off in the Eclipse preferences and 
rely on coloring for key words?
&gt; If I read the patches properly, we are ignoring then operating system spacing

Yes, you read patches properly.


&gt; Michel, why don't you just turn bold fonts off in the Eclipse preferences and
rely on coloring for key words?

It is same as solution 3 in #9? I have said that the solution reduces user
experience. If this solution can satisfy everyone, the bold option for key word
highlighting is not needed. So you should eliminate the bold option for key word
highlighting from Eclipse. Steve, why does Eclipse have bold option for key word
highlighting? Of course, many people think it's useful. Many people who uses
'pseudo monospace font' think it's useful too and hope to use it.
&gt; it doesn't seem right to do this.

I can't understand. What's wrong?
*** Bug 70817 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Steve says, "We won't override the operating system behavior, especially when
there is an option in the Eclipse UI to disable bolding".
This feature is expected to all usual editors. So, I think that Eclipse should
support it. (it is unnecessary for people who use only ISO-8859-X, however such
people is not the whole)

The most of japanese editors use more than one operating system API like my
patch when rendering bold font. 
I cannot believe that after so many years this issue is still open. I had the very same problem with Lucida Console. Lucida Typewriter was okay, though. I do think thise patch should make it into the core product.

A little hint for all those who wonder how to work around this problem: As I explained on StackOverflow [1], Microsoft Consolas is a good choice, even in size 8, as long as you activate ClearType. Dina is also okay, but I prefer Consolas.

    <WithOutStack>Many programmers like editing a program with monospace font.
Many programmers like syntax highliting with bold.
However, many monospace fonts have a problems that width of bold gryph is not
same as regular, like MS Gothic in Windows.
Force monospace feature corrects this problem, in  draw time.
I believe that force monospace feature increase user experience.

Principle is simple, if font style of run is not regular,
recalculate position and width of each gryph with regular style, 
and set these position and width to the run.

It is very easy to implement force monospace feature in win32.
You may implement force monospace feature in gtk and carbon, but it is not so
much easy as win32.
Maybe, it is difficult to implement in motif and emulate(photon), 
because these platform do not have the way to operate the gryph position and width.

I have fixed the error in the main method, but typically we don't use the main to run tests (instead: Run As-&gt;JUnit Test or JUnit Plug-in Test).

ComboViewerTest inherits about 25 test methods from its superclass.


We are going to do a widget independant Table for 3.3 - any solution we should do should follow the same route in case there is another Combo in the future that may want to create it's own viewer.
ComboViewer inherits from AbstractListViewer which is already widget-independent.  All we need is a test for the CCombo case (should be very easy - see comments 5,6,7). 
Patch #2 released with minor edits (contribution comment, @since tags, minor change to Javadoc of getCombo and getCCombo). I created a new test class by subclassing StructuredViewerTest. Sebastian, thanks for your patch. See bug 91666 for how to decide between Combo and CCombo.

    <WithStack>Please consider the following scenario:
1      long lNow = System.currentTimeMillis();
2      element.setValuesAsDateAsLong(lNow);
3      long value = element.getValuesAsDateAsLong();
4      assertEquals(lNow, value);

This test fails at line 3 due to this exception :

 java.lang.IllegalStateException: 2004-07-01T09:27:48.773Z is not a valid 
xsd:dateTime
 at 
org.eclipse.hyades.logging.events.cbe.impl.ExtendedDataElementImpl.getValuesAsDa
teAsLong(Line:3)

Also When I use the following code:
1      long lNow = System.currentTimeMillis();
2      element.setValuesAsDateAsLong(lNow);
3      String StringValue = (String)element.getValues().get(0);
4      long value = Date.parse(StringValue);
5      assertEquals(lNow, value);

This test fails at line 4 due to this exception :

 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
 at java.util.Date.parse(Date.java:593)
 at Line 4.

 So:
 extended element can set date value but fails to get it.
Date value listed in values List are represented as String that is unparsable 
by java.util.Date.parse(String) 
How can we parse that value???

Can you point Islam to the proper utility methods for working with datetimes?  
Thanks.

    <WithStack>In Java editor you can push F3 to jump into the definition of the element under
cursor. It will be very convenient to have similar feature for Ant editor:

-- Jump into the property definition (ideally it should also resolve properties
loaded from the external file and allow to choose which one you want to jump to)

-- Target definition (from project/@default, target/@depends, ant/@target,
antcall/@target). This can be even configurable, so user can add custom/optional
tasks into the list, e.g. to support for-each task).

Thank you.
There are several ant tasks that may accept class as one of the parameters (e.g.
"java"), so it would be handy to be able to jump into that class. However
similar functionality is awailable in Any Edit Tools plugin.
http://andrei.gmxhome.de/anyedit/
I am going to break this bug up as the implementation details for the 
enhancements are varied.

This bug will remain for the target definition navigation.

Created bug 75759 for property navigation
Created bug 75760 for Java class navigation
Added F3 navigation for targets in Ant buildfiles.
Changes to AntEditor and AntModel.
Please verify Luc.
Verified.
Please update the build notes, Darin S.
Thanks. Build notes updated.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Ant can handle different types for properties: value, location, refId. It is
strongly recommended to use location to specify any references to the files or
directories and it is also common practice to extend location properties, e.g.
${lib.dir}/log4j.jar. So, completion can recognize location properties and offer
to choice files and directories at given location.
We provide assistance for refId.

You are asking to be provided with all other location properties as possible 
completions when definining the location attribute for a new property?
Actually I'm asking to enable completion for file names. :)
Ok :-) that begs the question...where would I get a list of filenames to 
present to the user?
Well, I guess in the same place where Ant would get the actual files. Usually
build.xml reside in the right place and you can start from the current dir,
unless there is a prefix, that is loaded from external .properties or specified
in another local property...
unfortunately this feature will not be implemented for 3.1
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Please add completion drop-down to the entry fields that requires to type
file/directory name (e.g. Project Import Wizard/Project Content field, New
Project Wizard/ External Location, New file/Advanced/Link to the file system,
etc). It should proide a choice of the files/directories for current location,
so it will be possible to save some time and don't use "Browse" button in most
of the cases. 

This feature is supported natively on Windows 2000/XP in all Open/Choice
directory/Save as... dialogs.
The problem with doing this for import especially is that we would have to 
read a directory every time qwe did it (thats why we only do it when the entry 
field loses focus).

The performance hit outweighs the convenience.
Tod, I'd like to suggest a workarround for this. You can start reading directory
only when user actually typed some char, this will limit the number of matched
files/dirs. 

If you still think that it will hit a performance, then please read directory
and show a drop-down with the result only if user hit a special shorcut (e.g.
Ctrl-Space like in other places). This approach will also work for me. I truly
believe that performance hit of this will be way less then forcing user to open
browse dialog, which could be quite slow by itself. I really hate to wait when
directory chooser on windows walks trough all network drives to capture drive
labels or some other information. :-(
This is exactly what we did and the problem is that we have to populate a 
whole table to do it. The way we could do it is to follw the same population 
algorithm as the table viewer - that is to do it as a background job that can 
be cancelled when anotehr keystroke comes in.

I'll leave this open as with the jobs support the method you suggest is 
possible now and I'll rename the report appropriately.
Thanks Tod. I just want to point out that in most cases it should not be an
issue, because size of the result will be within 5..10 choices, because it is
only per current directory, basically last "\". And if you'll go with a custom
triggerred drop-down (e.g. user hit Ctrl-Space), it will be explicit action that
is called by the user, so performance should not be an issue at all, because
user asked for that action.
The performance issue is actually updating the table when you do get a valid 
entry BTW.
Hmm, it is sound strange. Entire table should be fetched completely at that
moment user hit "/" it will include all files in the directory, so when result
it shown, it can be probably filtered in memory without rereading if from the
disk on the next keystroke. There colud be some logic around that to save some
roundtrips to the disk (if it will be necessary), and again it only happens when
user requested it by hitting a Ctrl-Space it should not be an issue.
The "text field + browse button" metaphor is pervasive within apps built on Eclipse. If someone wants to take a stab at providing the functionality described here, we would be happy to discuss it with them, but it would need to be done in a way that doesn't introduce inconsistencies (e.g. it works in platform dialogs but not in ones provided by the other plug-ins).

In general, we rely on the native dialogs to provide the optimizations that make sense on each platform.

    <WithStack>The method TestSearchEngine.hasSuiteMethod(IType) does not consider the return

class being public and having a public static suite() method.

If you have implemented a class different than a JUnit test suite, but having a 
public static suite() method, you will have the "Run" -&gt; "JUnit Test" action in 
the context menu available. Invoking the action will cause an error (a 
ClassCastException in the 3.0 version?).

Usually this will not be likely to happen, but e.g. when using the JDemo 
framework (www.jdemo.de), there are suite methods like this:
  
  public static IDemo suite() {
    DemoSuite suite = new DemoSuite("Demo for de.jdemo.examples.awt");
    //$JDemo-BEGIN$
    suite.addDemo(new DemoSuite(AwtDemoCaseUsageDemo.class));
    //$JDemo-END$
    return suite;
  }

In the JDemo plugin there are launch shortcuts for demo suites as well as there 
are launch shortcuts for test suites in the JUnit plugin. So the problem is very 
annoying when using both plugins.
TestSearchEngine is defined in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.util.

JDK 1.5 is not yet supported by Eclipse. Do you have the same problem running 
1.4.2?
Cannot reproduce. I can launch Eclipse 3.0 on JDK 1.4.2 and debug on JDK 1.5
beta 2 no problem. Are you getting this problem consistently? If so, have you
tried starting over from scratch with a new Eclipse 3.0 install (as opposed to
installing and then deleting plugins)? It shouldn't make any difference, but it
would be good to try.
From bug 44270 comment 11 and 12, it looks like your VM installation is messed
up such that the debug libraries aren't present. Did you install a JRE instead
of a JDK? If not, you might have got a bad download or something. I'd try
grabbing the JDK again and re-installing.
I uninstalled 1.5 and used the 1.4 install and debugging does again work.   I
thought the use of the -vm should force Eclipse to startup the specified JVM,
with was 1.4.2_04.  Does that not work?</WithStack>

Thanks, Greg! I'll review these and try to get them in this week. I'll also 
turn on Mac builds as part of our nightly builds for 2.1 (off of HEAD). I'll 
also take you up on your offer and fire defects your way.
I have committed the patch. The only change I made was to the default Scanner config to make sure it 
didn't use the Windows version which makes a call to Cygwin's cygpath utility (which, of course, isn't 
there). I'll try this out for a while and fire defects your way as I see them.

    <WithStack>Starting eclipse 3.0 with a JRE, running ant in workbench jre, using the 
default ant classpath which automatically includes what looks like the correct 
tools.jar, I still get this message:

BUILD FAILED: D:\workspace\espresso\build.xml:79: Unable to find a javac 
compiler;
com.sun.tools.javac.Main is not on the classpath.
Perhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK

${java.class.path} is set to "java.class.path = D:\eclipse_3.0\startup.jar"
${project.class.path} is not set.

Adding the same tools.jar as an external jar works, but should not be 
nessesary since it is already listed under "Additional tasks &amp; support".

Starting eclipse with "-vm" and a JDK solves the problem, but should not be 
nessesary.
Move to Platform/Ant
What tools.jar is included on the Ant runtime classpath? Is it resolved from 
the JAVA_HOME environment variable?

I cannot reproduce your problem.
The tools.jar is resolved from the JRE settings of the ANT "External Tools" 
setting.  I have not set the JAVA_HOME environment variable outside Eclipse.  
I run ANT in the same JRE as Eclipse to get console input.

Sorry, now I am confused :-)
You state that you are running Eclipse using a JRE (not a JDK so no tools.jar)
You state that you are running the ant build in the same JRE as Eclipse (still 
no tools.jar). 
I don't see where the tools.jar is coming from?

My apologies :)  I am running Eclipse from a JDK, with a tools.jar.  I am 
running the ant build in the same JRE as Eclipse (the JRE included in the 
JDK).  The tools.jar is automatically discovered from the JDK, but cannot be 
found when using the &lt;javac&gt; ant task.

I cannot reproduce the problem. I get a tools.jar on all classpaths and all 
javacs work as expected.
your report is not consistent: 
comment #1: running Eclipse using a JRE, problem fixed if use -vm to point to 
JDK

comment #5: running Eclipse using a JDK. Are you pointing to a diff JDK 
install when you use -vm as stated in comment #1?

If there is anything else you could add to help in reproduction of the problem 
that would be greatly appreciated.
I just tried it again with Eclipse 3.1M1, and it seems to work fine.  Maybe it 
is fixed or maybe my setup was at fault.  Anyway, you may close the bug as 
fixed :)  I hope I didn't waste your time.
Thanks for reporting back.

    <WithStack>hi,

if a project is stored in cvs in a folder called "abc", and the .project-file
inside that folder says, that the name is "def", than i'd expect the checked out
project to be named "def" and not "abc". instead, the project is always called
like the folder, and i have to override it manually.
I suspect that this has always been the case - since 1.0.
the first point is, that the name of the project, and the .project file aren't
consistent anymore. The project is named "abc", but the .project file says "def". 

In addition, names of projects are important, since they are shared among the
developers of a team, that share their projects via CVS vor example.

Also see Bug 69268.
There is nothing we can do about this from a team/CVS standpoint. I'm moving 
this to Core. The project name is the .project file is ignored so I suspect it 
will be marked as WONTFIX. A workaround is to use the synchronize view and 
perform a Remove from View on the .project file when you check out a project 
using a different name and  aprojetc description change dirties the file. If 
you perform all your future commits from the synchronize view, they will 
always exclude the .project.
If you use "Check Out As..." from the CVS Repositories view, you can use
whatever name you want for the local project.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>It is problematic, that the project-names are referenced in .classpath files.
I'd like random IDs better, since that way project-dependencies could be shared
with other people in a team.
The way it is now, all people in a team have to have the same project-names to
be abled to do that.
What would this random ID be then and how could it be shared amongst 
developpers ?
The Project-ID could be an addition property of a project. It than must be
stored in the .project file and referenced by the .classpath files instead of
the project names.

The Project-ID would be a 32-bit (or longer) integer value, and it would be
chosen by random if a project is created. Even among diffenrent computers, there
shouldn't be much collisions.
BTW: i assume that the .project file is shared among the developers.
I also filed Bug 69267 since the project-name isn't really honoured when a
project is checked out. So the project-names are pretty much the badest thing to
use for a file like .classpath which is shared among many developers in a team.
Then, once you checked out a project. It references subsequent projects, and 
only tells you about unbound IDs. How can you figure the missing ones, do you 
check them all out ? Having the name show up is likely a very good hint for 
your teammates, and you simply agree that people should change the name on 
checkout (unless they want to fixup all dependent project classpaths).
OK, but than Bug 69267 should be "fixed". Either make Eclipse keeping the name
of the project and the project-name in the .project-file consistent, or don't
store the project-name in the .project file, since it isn't necessarily used by
Eclipse.
Comment#4 should have been reading: "[...] you simply agree that people should 
NOT change the name on checkout [...]".

Bug 69267 looks like a real inconsistency, which is misleading I believe.

Closing this one, since no action is planned on the build path.</WithStack>

of the project and the project-name in the .project-file consistent, or don't
store the project-name in the .project file, since it isn't necessarily used by
Eclipse.
Comment#4 should have been reading: "[...] you simply agree that people should 
NOT change the name on checkout [...]".

Bug 69267 looks like a real inconsistency, which is misleading I believe.

Closing this one, since no action is planned on the build path.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Currently there is no way to edit the profiling set description, so when a user 
create a new one, its description are all set to be the same and not editable. 
However, we should disable the edit option if the profiling set are predefine 
ones.
Actually it is possible, but it's in a bad place (click "Rename...") to rename 
the set; it also lets you edit the description.
It seems odd to me that the user has to go to different places to edit 
different parts of the profiling set. That is, the name and description are 
done via Rename, but the content is via Edit. We should consider putting all 
these in the same edit dialog.

An example of integer literal which JLS does not allow

This code, which Eclipse 3.0(Build 200406251208) compiles without complaining
anything, should not be compiled, because decimal literals(10) are written in
full width digits(U+FF10..U+FF19) while JLS(Java Language Specification)
specifies decimal integer literals only consists of 0..9.
[http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html#48282]


Full width digits appear in JIS(Japanese Industrial Standards) X 0208 and
adopted into Unicode for compatibility use only.
Character.isDigit returns true for these digits.
We use Character.isDigit(...) to find out if we have a digit.
I will double-check the specs.
We should replace all calls to Character.isDigit with the following code:
private boolean isDigit(char c) throws InvalidInputException {
	if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
		switch(c) {
			case '0' :
			case '1' :
			case '2' :
			case '3' :
			case '4' :
			case '5' :
			case '6' :
			case '7' :
			case '8' :
			case '9' :
				return true;
		}
		throw new InvalidInputException(Scanner.INVALID_DIGIT);
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
Fixed and released in HEAD.
Regression test added.
Should address in 3.0.1 stream as well. 
The fix is ready to be released in the 3_0_maintenance. In 3.0.1, the error will
be an invalid input. In 3.1, it will be an invalid digit.

If I add a space after the #recycle() no warning is reported:

I think this warning shouldn't be issued.
There must be a white space character after the @see reference otherwise Javadoc
will generate a warning...
But of course compiler should not complain when there's comment end characters
even if there are stuck to reference...
Fixed.

Compiler does not longer complain on this syntax.

Another related problem I'm having repeatedly is that when I cut some text,
nothing is copied to the clipboard.  Copying works ok.  For performing a cut
operation, I must copy and then delete.

A clue to the first behaviour I have observed:
It happens when I edit the code in a view belonging to the "Visual Editor".  If
I edit it in a regular Java View, it doesn't happen.

The 2nd problem also happens with a Java view.
My previous comment isn't true, the bug isn't specific to the Visual Editor.
I tried many times and use the editors on a daily basis and cannot reproduce on
fresh Eclipse SDK 3.0. Please reopen with steps to reproduce if you see this in
a fresh Eclipse SDK environment (comment 4 shows that several non-SDK plug-ins
have been installed).

Think this bug is a duplicated for 57868
I have turned off folding as suggested in the description of that bug.
Well, it cannot be a duplicate since the bug is marked as fixed for 3.0.

You didn't tell us how you select i.e. whether you use Ctrl+ (see comment 0), so
how exactly do you select line 265 to 270?

If folding is disabled then it works but when it is enabled it does not work,
right? Is something folded when opening the attached file?

Best would be to provide exact steps based on plain Eclipse SDK.
Conclusions:

1) It does not depend on the method you use to invoke copy: main menu, Ctrl+C,
Ctrl+insert
2) Happens only with Java editors
3) Happens quite often
4) Cut fails more than the equivalent combination Copy+Delete
5) Cheetah plugin isn't installed.
When I copy some code and paste it in another file, the necessary imports are
pasted, but nothing else.  External programs view the clipboard as empty.

Does this provide any light of what it may be the cause?
Please answer all the questions that I asked before reopening.

Get rid of deprecated state.

    <WithOutStack>In attached file, I have selected from line 265 to 270, both inclusive.
I select Edit | Copy from the menu, but nothing is copied to the clipboard.
If I try to Cut, the text is removed but no copy is either placed in the clipboard.
Created attachment 12961
Sample file where bug happens
Another related problem I'm having repeatedly is that when I cut some text,
nothing is copied to the clipboard.  Copying works ok.  For performing a cut
operation, I must copy and then delete.
You did not specifiy a build id.
Works for me using R3.0. Please reopen if you see this in R3.0 or newer.

I can live with the rearrangement of the @ejb.bean tag. But, placing

Update (workaround): 
If the positions of the @ejb.util and @ejb.remote-facade are swaped formatting
turns out ok. The bug seems to appear when the @tag has no value associated with it.

    <WithStack>When pressing CTRL-SPACE in a java or build.xml file, a list of suggestions 
for text to be inserted appears.  The first line is selected, but only with 
the "inactive" color, a very pale grey.  It should be highlighted properly 
with white text on blue background.

Clicking once on the selected item makes it properly highlighted, but should 
not be nessessary.

As it is, the selected item is practically indistinguisable (sp?) from the 
other items, which makes it hard to use this feature using only the keyboard.

    <WithStack>Eclipse 3.0 diables a keybinding when the same keySequence with the same
contextId is registered more than once. We could do better in such cases:

There should be a defined sequence for trying all of the conflicting handler
submissions (e.g. depth-first traversal in the plugin-dependencies tree). When a
handler submission has set the "handled" attribute to false, the next handler
should be tried, etc., until a handler has handled the shortcut.

[This is part (a) of bug 33161 comment 8.]
Can you give a concrete example? 
I tried to hack a plugin which contributes a "Select All" handler for all Tree
and Table widgets to the keybinding Ctrl+A.

I used ...
      &lt;command
            name="Select All"
            description="Select all items in a Tree or a Table"
            categoryId="org.eclipse.ui.category.widget"
            id="tree.key.selectall"&gt;
      &lt;/command&gt;
      &lt;handlerSubmission
            commandId="tree.key.selectall"
            handler="tree.key.SelectAllHandler" /&gt;
      &lt;keyBinding
            commandId="tree.key.selectall"
            contextId="org.eclipse.ui.contexts.dialogAndWindow"
            keyConfigurationId="org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration"
            keySequence="Ctrl+A"&gt;
      &lt;/keyBinding&gt;

... to contribute my subclass of AbstractHandler. In getAttributeValuesByName(),
I set the attribute "handled" to false iff the current focus control is not a
Table or a Tree.

I expected the keyboard/command service to fall through the first handler and
try the second one iff there are multiple handlers for the same contextId.
The handled attribute is a hack to support the migration of RetargetAction to 
the commands architecture.  It is meant to avoid swallowing the key, but not to 
provide a fallthrough mechanism.  I'm sorry that this isn't better documented. 
 
Why don't you want to use the default select all handler? 
No response.  Closing as WORKSFORME.  Please re-open if this is still a 
problem.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When executing a test using the Test Execution Harness with the default Data
Processor, the traces sent by the tester to the host are printed to the standard
output console. These traces are usually not visible to the user when Eclipse is
launched from a shortcut, but they are if it is launched from a console, as it
is rather common on UNIX systems. They may be huge if the tester runs for a long
time. Another drawback is that theses traces are slowing down the data
processor's job. This is likely a regression since these traces didn't use to
appear until recently.

    <WithStack>With Eclipse 3.0 final

I've got a quite annoying message warning me about an 'AST creation error'.
An error dialog opens about 5 times successively with this message. 

I'm using a plugin, implementors, that produces also an error but i don't know
if this is the cause of the AST issue. 
The file where this error appear contains a reference to an interface that i
have deleted. 

Here is the log of the error:

    <WithOutStack>With Eclipse 3.0 final

I've got a quite annoying message warning me about an 'AST creation error'.
An error dialog opens about 5 times successively with this message. 

I'm using a plugin, implementors, that produces also an error but i don't know
if this is the cause of the AST issue. 
The file where this error appear contains a reference to an interface that i
have deleted. 

Here is the log of the error:

When I edit it with Eclipse, line separator for modified lines are changed for

comparing with the latest version in SourceSafe, differences are reported (the
line separators).

This didn't happen in Eclipse 2.1

Couldn't it use the same line separator used originally in the file?

    <WithStack>Hello open source world,

	I am using the Latest Eclipse build (Build Id:-200406301200) with 
compatible CDT plugins on Linux platform.
When I try debugging a C or C++ project, I am getting the following error.

"Launching (Error: Target request failed: Target is not responding(timed out).)

However, there was no such problem with the earlier releases.

I have the latest version of debugger. May I know what causes this problem.

Please help me to make it work.

Thanks in advance,
Ragav.

Please check your path to make sure you have
a version of gdb that is 5.2.1 or later versions.
You can verify by typing:
# gdb -i mi1

In the CDT FAQ web pages it describes a way to get
the output of gdb via trace logging, I would like
to see this.  So far, I do not have enough information
on what is a problem to be of good help.

Thanks

I've look at the the trace and it seems to work ok.

However, you seem to have the disassembly view on.
Turn this off for the test, i.e. do not use the disassembly view.
that will help us isolate the problem.  Do the normal next/next.

what is of surpise to me is this:

After the print out, the program stop for unknown reason, just
"*stopped" for unknown reasons or it reach the end.

With the disassembly off is it working better ?

  Do you have an HP machine to quickly run hello_world
type of program on the debugger ?
We do not have any HP machine here, so debugging this
is extremmely painfull.  If an hello_world type of program
does not work, could you send me the MI log trace ...

Note: you need gdb-5.2.1 or newer on HP

HP-UX SOM Binary parser patch

HP-UX SOM Binary parser patch
I was not able to make Debugging work in CDT 2.0 GA on HP-UX because there is  
only one Debugger available in the C/C++ Local configuration and that is GDB  
Server. When I was trying to debug the HelloWorld application with this  
debugger I was getting errors (same as Ragav, and some similar ones).  
  
Then I applied a quick fix to the new HP-UX SOM binary parser and got GDB  
Debugger as well, which worked just fine.  
  
Attached are the patch and the GDB trace output of successful debugging  
session. The patch is applicable to both HEAD and the branch.  
Created attachment 13547
GDB session output
I have narrowed down the problem to MIPlugin.java Line No:166 (see the attached 
file). In this code, there are two blocks one if pty == null and other for pty !
=null.

 If pty !=null, then tty and pty.getSlaveName() is sent as parameters  and 
libpty.so comes into action. 

 If pty = null , then tty and pty.getSlaveName() is not available as parameters 
and libpty.so does not come into action. 

 When I encountered this "Target not responding" exception, I drilled down that 
this happens because of the two arguments tty and pty.getSlaveName() and then 
commented them out from the code. The debugger worked perflectly fine. Now I 
got confused , if the debugger works perfectly fine without these tty options 
then why should we have this code. I am sure I am missing something. Can you 
set me the right context?
 I perfectly understand that by setting the "tty", we redirect our gdb output 
to Eclipse console rather than the pseudo terminal or standart input/output. 
Well this problem occurs even in Eclipse 3.0 + CDT 2.0.

&gt; if the debugger works perfectly fine without these tty options

As you pointed out, the PTY support is to redirect the output
to the console(Eclipse) and also some applications __need__
a TTY stream to work/behave etc ...

Some platforms do not have PTY(See org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32)
and do not provide a libpty.so.  It looks like the pty handling
is not working for HP.  We could fix the code or remove
the pty.so completely.

Doug/vlad what do you think ?  Unfortunately we do not have 
HP machines here to commit to fix this code, somebody else will
have to step in.

Thanks Vlad,
 another PR was created to track this down:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=70820


Is there any progress done with this PR.
Ragav, was saying that the PTY handling code is buggy,

We don't have HP here, so it will be up the folks having
HP boxes to provide a fix for this .
I'm pretty sure HP has a lot of HP machines around :-). Guys, please feel free 
to send in patches to make the CDT work better on your platforms. We'll be 
happy to review them and apply them as necessary.

Just for the record, there is no HP version of libpty.so because there is no 
org.eclipse.cdt.core.hpux fragment. Therefore pty is always equal to null so 
tty and pty.getSlaveName() never make it to the argument list. I am not quite 
clear why it was necessary to remove them from the code.

Still I was able to debug an application (even without HP-UX binary parser) 
using GDB Debugger (not Server) launch configuration.

    <WithStack>My Server is behind a firewall
In order for teh client to connect to RAC, I opened the port 10002.
But it seems the client is also opening random port so the server can connect back.
It would be good to be bale to specify a unique port or at least a range of
ports so I can manage my firewall

The AnnotationModel manipulates the document's positions, its annotation map and
its annotation model event unsynchronized. For example in
AnnotationModel#addAnnotation(..), the following calls are not synchronized:

if (!fAnnotations.containsKey(annotation)) {
	addPosition(fDocument, position);
	fAnnotations.put(annotation, position);
	synchronized (getLockObject()) {
		getAnnotationModelEvent().annotationAdded(annotation);
	}
...
Each call itself is using a lock object but some of the calls should be locked
all together to guarantee atomic behavior.

Note: AnnotationModel.cleanup(boolean, boolean) has been changed in one of the
3.0 RCs: it can fire the model changed in a new thread.
Attachments are not accessed in a thread-safe manner either. Found the following

The problem is that
    ProjectionSummary.internalUpdateSummaries(IProgressMonitor) line: 164	
can change the lock object of the AnnotationMap while the lock is already being taken. If another thread then synchronizes on the new lock, it gets free access to the same HashMap.


Steps to reproduce in HEAD:

- Set a breakpoint in ProjectionSummary#internalUpdateSummaries(..) at first call to "sync.setLockObject(..)" (line 164)
- Set a breakpoint in BracketInserterTest#testMultiplePeerEntry() at
'type("((((");' (line 255)

- Debug BracketInserterTest#testMultiplePeerEntry() (only this single test method)

=&gt; One of the suspended threads is in
    ProjectionSummary.internalUpdateSummaries(IProgressMonitor) line: 164	
- Open the local variable 'sync' and write down the id of the field
    fAnnotations= AnnotationMap

- Set breakpoint in AnnotationMap#keySetIterator() inside the synchronized block (line 82)
- Resume the main thread a few times until the 'this' variable has the id you've written down before. WARNING: The Debug view tries sometimes steals your selection and selects the ProjectionSummary thread (bug 229536). Be careful and resume only when you're sure the main thread has focus.

- In the main thread, step INTO the new ArrayList(..) constructor and into "c.toArray(elementData)", and then step over "Iterator it=iterator();" (so that the debug pointer ends up on the next line with the for statement).
- Disable all breakpoints
- Resume the ProjectionSummary thread

- In the main thread, you can now see that the modCount in the HashMap has changed. When you resume, you get this exception:

Fix for ProjectionSummary

Here's a patch that fixes the problem in ProjectionSummary by synchronizing on the original lock object while the summary annotations are being updated. I didn't find problems with it and AllTextTests is still green with the patch.

Dani, could you please have a look? I did not yet look at the performance implications of this fix, but I think any solution needs to hold both locks Maybe we could also just synchronize on the document lock and avoid calling setLockObject(..) at all.
re comment #13: good catch!

&gt;Maybe we could also just synchronize on the document lock and avoid calling
&gt;setLockObject(..) at all.
I think we should even go further and make sure that the visual model uses the same lock as the underlying model since they operate on the same document.

I will try that approach.

The AnnotationModel manipulates the document's positions, its annotation map and
its annotation model event unsynchronized. For example in
AnnotationModel#addAnnotation(..), the following calls are not synchronized:

if (!fAnnotations.containsKey(annotation)) {
	addPosition(fDocument, position);
	fAnnotations.put(annotation, position);
	synchronized (getLockObject()) {
		getAnnotationModelEvent().annotationAdded(annotation);
	}
...
Each call itself is using a lock object but some of the calls should be locked
all together to guarantee atomic behavior.

3.0 RCs: it can fire the model changed in a new thread.

    <WithStack>Checking out some modules in an existing project run well. Updating the project 
in resource view failed with an lock-error because of checking out CVSROOT. In 
our repositories the directory CVSROOT can't and shoudn't be checked out by a 
normal user. 
Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.5 (client/server) on Solaris
drwxrwsr-x   admin-user   admin-group    CVSROOT
drwxrwxr-x   normal-user  normal-group   bin
CVSROOT\Emptydir
drwxrwxr-x   normal-user  admin-group      96 Jul  5 10:45 Emptydir

I think the reason is, that update now, in opposite of eclipse 2.1.x, want to 
check out CVSROOT if the option 'fetch absent directories on update' is set. If 
the option is reset, it works. 

What can be done to 'fetch absent directories on update' belonging to the 
modules checked out in the project but not all the absent modules in the 
repository including CVSROOT.
Could you perform the steps outlined in the following URL to capture a trace 
of the failed update and attch the trace to this bug. This will help us 
understand why the CVSROOT/Emptydir is being updated.

You have included the output in the CVS console in Eclipse. What about the 
output to stdout (i.e. when you run Eclipse with java.exe and the other 
options mentioned in the URL, you should have gotten a DOS console to which 
the stdout of Java would be dumped. Can you attach what appeared there as well?
I've put these output in the last comment, perhaps not easy to see. You find it 
if you search for "c:\jdk1.3.1\jre\bin\java.exe".
Right. I see it now. It looks like the .options file didn't have the right 
debug trace enablement. Did you add the debug enablement lines from the URL to 
file C:/Programme/eclipse 3.0M2/.options? The lines should be:

   org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/debug=true
   org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/cvsprotocol=true

Although you should also be able to enable tracing using the "Display detailed 
protocol output to stdout" option on the Team/CVS preference page.
Sorry, now I started eclipse in the directory where the exe is installed.

C:\Programme\eclipse 3.0M2\eclipse&gt;more .options
org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/debug=true
org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/cvsprotocol=true

C:\Programme\eclipse 3.0M2\eclipse&gt;eclipse -vm C:\jdk1.3.1\jre\bin\java.exe   -d
ata C:\eclipse\workspace -debug -consolelog

Is it now the right output ?

!MESSAGE cvs_sudo_test: cvs [server aborted]: read lock failed - giving up
There is something quite odd about the trac you have provided. You are 
checking out the module "eigener_test" and the checkout seems to have gone 
well. However, the update you are doing seems to be on a project that 
contain "eigener_test" asw a subdirectory. Is this correct? Can you give me 
the details of the operatios you performed so I can match them to the trace
(i.e. the trace doesn't contain that information).
It's right what you said. 
The user check out some modules from a repository to a project (here 
eigener_test from repository cvs_sudo_test in project cvs_sudo_test). After 
some time they want to make an update of all the modules checked out, so they 
make team update of the project, that means update all the modules included in 
the project (here update project cvs_sudo_test - and therefore update module 
eigener_test).
And how did they create the project "cvs_sudo_test"?
Create new project (file - new - project) - simple project - name the project - 
finish.
Sorry, I should have stated my question better. How did the project get 
created and shared with the repository root (as it appears to be from the 
trace). It would be easiest if you gave me a complete explanation of all the 
steps that you take to cause the problem to happen and provide as much detail 
as possible. I could then match this up with the trace to determine where the 
problem is.
There are only a few steps

cvs-view:           - add a new cvs-repository (/cm/cvsstst/cvs_sudo_test)
resource-view:      - create a simple project (cvs_sudo_test)
                      in my tests the project is named as the repository
cvs-view:           - expand the head (from cvs_sudo_test)
                    - mark a module (eigener_test)
                    - check out as - in an existing project 
                      this is checkout 
                      /cm/cvsstst/cvs_sudo_test/eigener_test
                      in project cvs_sudo_test)
resource-view:      - mark project cvs_sudo_test
                    - team update 
that's all


OK, I've figured out what is going wrong. The repository you are using is 
configured to provide a top level admin directory (i.e. the 
line "TopLevelAdmin=yes" appears in your CVSROOT/config file). When you do a 
checkout of the "eigener_test" module into the simple project, Eclipse is 
receiving the top level admin directory and assigning it to the parent 
project. Eclipse CVS does ignore the top-level-admin when it is checking out a 
project (i.e. when the admin directory is the root of the repository). 
However, it does not when the top-level-admin folder is a project or 
subfolder. 

It's not clear to me what, if anything, we want to do here. The implication of 
configuring a repository to use topLevelAdmin is that the users will be able 
to perform an update on multiple projects but will not be able to use the -d 
option to fetch the absent directories. The current workarounds are to turn 
off topLevelAdmins, turn off fetch absent directories for the project or only 
perform updates on the subfolder that was checked out. Alternatively, the user 
could define a module in the CVSROOT/modules file that created a project that 
had the proper structure.

The problem would be lessened if the update command itself allowed the user to 
decide whether to fetch absent directories or not.
I'm a litle late, but last week I wasn't here. First thank you for your answer. 
Now I need to discuss the situation here. For this, please can you tell me the 
reason why eclipse version 3... handles the situation in another way as version 
2.1.x. Perhaps this will help us to find the right solution. 
Improvments were made to CVS checkout in 3.0. Unfortunately, these 
improvements had the unforseen consequences you are experiencing.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Checking out some modules in an existing project run well. Updating the project 
in resource view failed with an lock-error because of checking out CVSROOT. In 
our repositories the directory CVSROOT can't and shoudn't be checked out by a 
normal user. 
Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.5 (client/server) on Solaris
drwxrwsr-x   admin-user   admin-group    CVSROOT
drwxrwxr-x   normal-user  normal-group   bin
CVSROOT\Emptydir
drwxrwxr-x   normal-user  admin-group      96 Jul  5 10:45 Emptydir

I think the reason is, that update now, in opposite of eclipse 2.1.x, want to 
check out CVSROOT if the option 'fetch absent directories on update' is set. If 
the option is reset, it works. 

What can be done to 'fetch absent directories on update' belonging to the 
modules checked out in the project but not all the absent modules in the 
repository including CVSROOT.
Could you perform the steps outlined in the following URL to capture a trace 
of the failed update and attch the trace to this bug. This will help us 
understand why the CVSROOT/Emptydir is being updated.

You have included the output in the CVS console in Eclipse. What about the 
output to stdout (i.e. when you run Eclipse with java.exe and the other 
options mentioned in the URL, you should have gotten a DOS console to which 
the stdout of Java would be dumped. Can you attach what appeared there as well?
I've put these output in the last comment, perhaps not easy to see. You find it 
if you search for "c:\jdk1.3.1\jre\bin\java.exe".
Right. I see it now. It looks like the .options file didn't have the right 
debug trace enablement. Did you add the debug enablement lines from the URL to 
file C:/Programme/eclipse 3.0M2/.options? The lines should be:

   org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/debug=true
   org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/cvsprotocol=true

Although you should also be able to enable tracing using the "Display detailed 
protocol output to stdout" option on the Team/CVS preference page.
Sorry, now I started eclipse in the directory where the exe is installed.

C:\Programme\eclipse 3.0M2\eclipse&gt;more .options
org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/debug=true
org.eclipse.team.cvs.core/cvsprotocol=true

C:\Programme\eclipse 3.0M2\eclipse&gt;eclipse -vm C:\jdk1.3.1\jre\bin\java.exe   -d
ata C:\eclipse\workspace -debug -consolelog

Is it now the right output ?

There is something quite odd about the trac you have provided. You are 
checking out the module "eigener_test" and the checkout seems to have gone 
well. However, the update you are doing seems to be on a project that 
contain "eigener_test" asw a subdirectory. Is this correct? Can you give me 
the details of the operatios you performed so I can match them to the trace
(i.e. the trace doesn't contain that information).
It's right what you said. 
The user check out some modules from a repository to a project (here 
eigener_test from repository cvs_sudo_test in project cvs_sudo_test). After 
some time they want to make an update of all the modules checked out, so they 
make team update of the project, that means update all the modules included in 
the project (here update project cvs_sudo_test - and therefore update module 
eigener_test).
And how did they create the project "cvs_sudo_test"?
Create new project (file - new - project) - simple project - name the project - 
finish.
Sorry, I should have stated my question better. How did the project get 
created and shared with the repository root (as it appears to be from the 
trace). It would be easiest if you gave me a complete explanation of all the 
steps that you take to cause the problem to happen and provide as much detail 
as possible. I could then match this up with the trace to determine where the 
problem is.
There are only a few steps

cvs-view:           - add a new cvs-repository (/cm/cvsstst/cvs_sudo_test)
resource-view:      - create a simple project (cvs_sudo_test)
                      in my tests the project is named as the repository
cvs-view:           - expand the head (from cvs_sudo_test)
                    - mark a module (eigener_test)
                    - check out as - in an existing project 
                      this is checkout 
                      /cm/cvsstst/cvs_sudo_test/eigener_test
                      in project cvs_sudo_test)
resource-view:      - mark project cvs_sudo_test
                    - team update 
that's all


OK, I've figured out what is going wrong. The repository you are using is 
configured to provide a top level admin directory (i.e. the 
line "TopLevelAdmin=yes" appears in your CVSROOT/config file). When you do a 
checkout of the "eigener_test" module into the simple project, Eclipse is 
receiving the top level admin directory and assigning it to the parent 
project. Eclipse CVS does ignore the top-level-admin when it is checking out a 
project (i.e. when the admin directory is the root of the repository). 
However, it does not when the top-level-admin folder is a project or 
subfolder. 

It's not clear to me what, if anything, we want to do here. The implication of 
configuring a repository to use topLevelAdmin is that the users will be able 
to perform an update on multiple projects but will not be able to use the -d 
option to fetch the absent directories. The current workarounds are to turn 
off topLevelAdmins, turn off fetch absent directories for the project or only 
perform updates on the subfolder that was checked out. Alternatively, the user 
could define a module in the CVSROOT/modules file that created a project that 
had the proper structure.

The problem would be lessened if the update command itself allowed the user to 
decide whether to fetch absent directories or not.
I'm a litle late, but last week I wasn't here. First thank you for your answer. 
Now I need to discuss the situation here. For this, please can you tell me the 
reason why eclipse version 3... handles the situation in another way as version 
2.1.x. Perhaps this will help us to find the right solution. 
Improvments were made to CVS checkout in 3.0. Unfortunately, these 
improvements had the unforseen consequences you are experiencing.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>If the Java &gt; Installed JREs preference page is active, any changes made by 
other preference pages to the JREs are lost even if no changes were made to 
the Installed JREs page. This scenario can occur when higher level tools need 
to make changes to JREs. For example, a preference page for a Java server 
runtime might provide a setting to change where the server is installed - if 
the server contains it's own JRE, then the underlying IVMInstall location 
should also be changed.

To reproduce, the scenario would be:

1. Go to Window &gt; Preferences.
2. Go to the Java &gt; Installed JREs preference page.
3. Go to another preference page that will make changes to the JREs.
4. Make some changes and click Ok. (Underlying page will make changes to one 
or more IVMInstalls and call JavaRuntime.saveVMConfiguration()).
5. Reopen preferences - the IVMInstall changes are lost.

Doing the same thing without step 2 will allow the changes to apply correctly.
The #performOK() method is called on the page even if no changes were made. We 
likely need to do two things:

(1) only save changes if changes were made
(2) look to see if someone else made changes to the installed VMs (i.e. when 
the page is opened, it should note the state. If changes were made on the 
page, but when we go to save, the original state is no longer the same, then 
saving should abort/report error?). We may be able to use 
the "IVMInstallChangedListener" mechanism to note there were changes, and if 
the changes are compatible with the changes we are going to make.

As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

    <WithStack>I input in the editor a call to a non-existing function in a inner class.
Code assist offers me 2 possibilities:
 1) create method mymethod()
 2) create method mymethod() in enclosing class (Main in the example below).

2nd choice doesn't work.  It does nothing

class Main {
    class Nested {
          void a() {
               mymethod();
          }
    }
}
It also fails in non-nested scenarios.
Steps to reproduce:

Include a call to a non-existant function.
Call code assist and select the correction: created method.
Nothing is done.
what build are you using? I can't reproduce this with 3.0
I think you are refereing to quick fix, not code assist.

For the given example the only quick fix I get is 'create method'. Note 
that 'create methid in enclosing class' is only available for methods in 
anonymous classes.

can you also check the .log file? Also have a look if something is shown in 
the status line.


Sorry, it was quick fix (Ctrl+1).
I'm using Eclipse 3.0 final.
No message in the status line.
If the method to be created resides in another class, Eclipse correctly switches
to that editor, but no new method is appended to the source code.

Hope this info is useful.
It seems you installed the 1.5 preview. quick fix and refactoring from 3.0 do 
not support this yet, but you can get an updated version, cheetah 6 it is

    <WithStack>Using Eclipse 3.0GA I did:
* Create a project to import stuff into.
* File -&gt; Import... -&gt; File system
* Choose any directory containing backup files (file names ending in ~).

Current behaviour:
The pane listing available files includes backup files.  The Filter Types...
button makes it possible to include files by type, but excluding backup files
isn't possible AFAICT.

Expected behaviour:
Backup files should be filtered out by default.
~ is not always a backup file but it might be useful to filter directory types 
as well as file types.
Just out of curiosity, can you come up with an example of when a file would be
named something ending in ~ but without being a backup file?

Not offhand but we could not assume that someone would not choose to use that 
as a prefix for something in thier product - as a framework we have to be 
pretty confident of the meaning of something to force everyone to use it.
Sounds reasonable, even though I'd find it pretty stupid to use foo~ for naming
something other than a backup.  Stranger things have happened.

Just to be sure that it was a typo and not a mis-understanding btw, when you
said "prefix", you really meant "suffix", right?

A backup file is a file named "whatever~", i.e. one whose name *ends* in "~".

Actually the answer is "both" - as a framework we can't make this decision - I 
have seen prodicts that use the ~ as a prefix or a suffix.
There's a related issue: On the Mac, every file has an associated metadata file that begins with ".". I'd like to see these hidden as well.

The problem is, the meaning of these files -- both metadata files and backup files -- is not specific to the platform you are running on, but is actually specific to the platform/tool that was used to create the file. Since we can't detect this, there's no way we can decide when it is appropriate to filter them out.

Given that we are using the platform dialogs, we also don't have an opportunity to add a "show hidden" button (or the like) to them, so there doesn't seem to be any simple way to provide this behavior, except perhaps adding a global preference something like the "Java -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Type Filters" preference. (/em gags.)

Having said that, if someone wants to take a stab at fixing this, we can definitely discuss the issues. For now, marking as WONTFIX.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In the 3.0, the code completion provides method stubs proposal, but also getter
and setters
(http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/R-3.0-200406251208/eclipse-news-part4-R3.html
; "Create getters and setters with code assist"). I would like to disable these
proposals, for example in code assist preferences :)
Is it all method subs and getter/setters or do you also want to hide code templates?

Do you want to enable them per category or all at once?

Disabling by category would be fine, but, in my case, disabling all at once is
sufficient.

I want to keep code template. Indeed, I have a custom method template, and when
I call it (the cursor is in a class, but out of method context), the code
completion proposes my custom template AND the corresponding method stub. I have
then to select the template. As I am a lazy boy, if the method stub is not
activated, my custom would be applied directly :)

An intermediate solution would be to order completion proposals, not only in
alphabetical order, with for example, code templates before method
stub/getter/setter.
Martin,
please comment as well (especially explain the current ordering).

the ordering for the method stubs is defined by jdt.core (relevance value), 
template relevance is defined by us

see bug 88213 for better sorting of sub proposals.

While the stubs currently can't be disabled separately, we have introduced content assist categories that may be disabled via the user preferences. Also, the fact that stubs and override proposals are never auto-inserted make them less annoying.

Marking as fixed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>This should be done, this abomination has lived on too long.
This will require cleaning up of some of the special tests in the parser 
package.  I would suggest adding IParser.getLastErrorLine() and removing 
getLastErrorOffset() to keep these tests working.

From bug 64347:

Key bindings are on the numpad which is not available (or difficult to access
with additional modifier key) on notebooks. It's also counter-intuitive to have
key bindings on the numpad different from those on the main keyboard.
No plans to change this.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In the project properties, adding a project in Java Build Project no longer adds
a Project Reference entry.  This is a shame since our ant build uses this as
dependancy information.

Rob
We are now setting project dynamic references, instead of static ones. 

These should be visible still through API: IProject.getReferencedProjects()
but no longer persisted in .project file, as no longer necessary. Dynamic 
project references allow to compute classpath dynamically, and not resulting 
in outgoing changes on .project file as a side-effect.

Please reopen if you found a case where the above API did not work correctly, 
and then provide steps to reproduce.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I have a dialog, and for some controls, I don't get any property shown 
In the attached file, this happens for the "cmpHayPuerto" and "cmpPrefijoArea"
controls.

VE version S20040628
Created attachment 12964
File where bug happens
Peter, or your help look at this one
I am not able to compile the  attached class as it has dependancies on other 
classes that are missing. (fcc.ima.gui.PanelListaTexto.java )

Also, by some reason the attached source is wrong; the class code is 
duplicated and many literals contain native characters, and my eclipse doen't 
like it at all.

Peter, i can't reproduce the problem due to those facts. I wonder, if this is 
the case, maybe we need to ask David check if this is the case? 

Hi David,
could you please try to change all literals and method names in your class to 
use non native characters to see if problem still exists?
Thanks you
