    <WithStack>preamble:
Testing CoolBar first on win32 and gtk, it seems that DragDetect is fired 
whenever a CoolItem is dragged, but it is NOT fired if a drag is initiated on a 
part of a CoolBar that is not a gripper.  I'm therefore assuming that the 
intent of DragDetect for CoolBars is to notify listeners precisely whenever a 
CoolItem drag begins.

steps for motif:
- run the ControlExample, select the CoolBar tab
- listen for DragDetect
- drag a CoolItem within the example CoolBar and note that no DragDetect is 
fired, so this is inconsistent with the behaviour that I assumed to be correct 
above and hence with the other platforms
- however, try to drag a CoolItem in the example CoolBar by using the correct 
motif drag trigger (either middle mouse button or a mouse chord) and note that 
DragDetect IS fired in this case, but the CoolItem will not become draggable 
since this isn't the trigger that the control wants
- so the platform trigger for DragDetect is being respected here, but in this 
case it doesn't match the semantics of the emulated widget, which uses button 1 
for dragging
DragDetect is intended to indicate that drag &amp; drop operation should start, 
not that a cool item has been dragged.  However, there seems to be a platform 
difference.
If the meaning of DragDetect is no different for CoolBar than for other 
widgets, then this is working correctly.  It's unfortunate that the trigger for 
dragging a CoolItem matches the usual drag trigger on some platforms but not on 
others (ie.- motif), because as a result there are probably clients that are 
hooking drag detect with the assumption that it behaves like the preamble from 
comment 0, and are failing on motif as a result of this not being true.

There is a platform difference that still needs to be addressed.

Closing report, platform is discontinued.</WithStack>

Probably true in Tree and Table as well.  I tried to work around this once. 
GTK is actually issuing two events.  The only way to fix this is to remember 
that a selection happened in mouse down and issue the selection in mouse up 
but only if a default selection has not happened.  Since this would be 
changing GTK platform behavior, I didn't attempt it.

Need to verify that GTK is in fact doing this and it's not an obvious bug in 
SWT.
I think GTK is doing it (there is no obvious bug in SWT in this part).
Changing the selection to happen on mouse up instead of using gtk_changed is
gonna cause trouble: the selection can be changed by keyboard input.

The problem is that GtkTreeView is using mouse down to implement the
gtk_changed, so a double click consist:
- mouse click -&gt; selection
- mouse click -&gt; selection
- mouse double click -&gt; default selection.

we can try to detect we are in the second mouse click with
" if ((event-&gt;button.time &lt; (display-&gt;button_click_time[0] +
display-&gt;double_click_time)) &amp;&amp;
           (event-&gt;button.window == display-&gt;button_window[0]) &amp;&amp;
           (event-&gt;button.button == display-&gt;button_number[0]) &amp;&amp;
           (ABS (event-&gt;button.x - display-&gt;button_x[0]) &lt;=
display-&gt;double_click_distance) &amp;&amp;
           (ABS (event-&gt;button.y - display-&gt;button_y[0]) &lt;=
display-&gt;double_click_distance))"


It means you must remember the time, the window, the button, and the x,y
position for every button down in the toolkit.







Some other possible solution is to use gtk_change when the event type is
keyboard and use mouse up to implement our own selection (as steve suggested).
I think it is too hacky.

Any other ideas ?

    <WithStack>I have built a data structure of binary tree by constructing a new class of
treenode containing an Object item and two treenode pointers.

Since I need to save this binary tree in a file, I use Serializable class of
Java to do that.

The strange thing is that I can run the program properly under eclipse but if I
invoke the debug mode and trace the program step by step, I've found that
eclipse fail to finishing tracing the program because it throws IOException
error when it read back the object from the file I have saved.

Do you need me to supply the source code for verification?

Source Code for demonstrating the bug

Please use the debug mode to run the TestBinaryTree.java and you should have
noticed the errors I have pointed out.
The example works for me in both run and debug modes.
May be I should elaborate more.

Please switch to debug mode and put a break point right before the line the
program read back the object, i.e.

h = (BinarySearchTree)in.readObject();

Then let's trace it step by step. When the program has just finishing processing
this line, it would jump to the Catch clause "IOException" instead of completing
the remaining steps.

Please comment whether it is a bug or not.

When I do this, the program steps over the line successfully and continues 
with the next lines. What VM version are you using?
I'm using version 1.4.2_04.

I have attached a screen capture of the error for your reference.

I have asked one of my programmers to test it using other machine and there was
no t any problem running it on that machine.

So it is a bit strange that my machine has this problem

Screen Capture when error occurs

Here comes the attachment of the screen capture when the error occurs
It looks like you have the program invoked twice. Does it fail if you 
only "debug" it once? (i.e. only debug one instance at a time)? (I cannot make 
it fail even with two).
Marking as works for me.</WithStack>

The context menu of the source tabs of the schema and plugin manifest editors
contain team-submenus Team, Replace With, and Compare With.

All three submenus contain each action twice.
Michael, how are these Team submenus added?  We never signed up for one, let 
alone two :-)
I believe that Doug did some magic that will add the menu to an editor on an 
IFile. Perhaps he was a bit to magical in this case.

    <WithStack>Anonymous inner classes are Java's kludge to almost get closures, and the Java
runtime libraries use them this way all over the place.

When I'm writing code that uses anonymous inner classes this way, I almost never
want JavaDoc for either the class itself or for the method(s) inside the class.

Since the intention for a method created inside an anonymous inner class is
different from the intention for a regular method, it would be nice if the
template the generates a method inside an anonymous inner class were different.

Then the template could omit JavaDoc, but I could get my JavaDoc by default for
regular methods.
we should add a new options to enable/disable the generation of comment in
annonymous classes
not for 3.1
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

It would be cool if the plugin manifest editor could retain the context when
switching tabs. I.e. when I'm editing an Extension Element Detail on the
"Extensions" tab and then switch to the plugin.xml tab, the selection should be
in the xml element corresponding to the field I was editing just before (and
vice versa).


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 61522 ***
The way bug 61522 was solved, this is not a complete duplicate any more.

In 3.3M1, GUI selections are mapped to text selections on the source pages (only at the element level, not for individual attributes, but I can live with that).

But the other way 'round, this still does not work. I'm sometimes editing on a source tab and then decide that some Form UI would be more helpful to solve the task. Currently, I always have to search the element again after switching to the GUI pages, since neither the "selected" element nor the Outline selection are taken over.

Could you reopen this bug or shall I file a new one?
You can reopen this one since the (vice versa) part was missed.  
Reopening and adjusting summary for remaining request.
hey JLB, how much work is it to do the other direction?
This may cause some unwanted behaviour for some users (that don't want their tree selections to be reset).  Maybe we should have a toggle for this functionality, possibly as a button in the form toolbar. What do you think Markus?
I'd vote against another toggle unless people really start asking for it.
I don't see a clear use case where users ...
- are on a form page
- switch to a source page
- change the selection on the source page
- switch back to the form page
... and expect the selection of the form page to remain constant.

If they just switch to a source page, scroll around, and then go back, the selection should not be affected. If they are e.g. on the Extensions page and then switch to the MANIFEST.MF page, the selection on the Extensions page should also not be affected (there's nothing on the Extensions page to match the source selection, hence the form's selection should not be changed).
Thanks for your input Markus.. I would however like to petition with the following as I believe it could be a common case.

When a user arrives at a source page (with the intent to inspect some xml) and a lot of text is selected, it would seem like a natural reaction to deselect the selection as inverted text is difficult to read. 
This would pose a problem of new elements being selected... it could be avoided if the user deselects within the element (but NOT within one of its children). 

We could work around this feature by introducing a context menu action (on the source page) which would bring focus to the appropriate element (and even attribute field) on the extensions page.

Markus and Wassim, what are your thoughts?
The "huge selection" is a bug in itself that I just didn't file so far (it's bug 154030 now;-). A "Show In" action would be better than nothing, but I still don't think it's necessary.

After all, the multi-page editor is just one editor, and having one selection shared across pages is the most natural behavior, IMO. Users who want two separate editors can always choose Window &gt; New Editor.
Janek, if we resolve bug 154030, we would address the valid issue you bring up in comment 8.

I was playing around with DreamWeaver today.  When you switch between the raw html and the design page, the cursor does retain the context.  However, they have an easier problem since they have no trees and no multipage editors.

However, I do believe that bug 154030 is the obstacle here to a reasonable solution to PDE.
Thanks for the feedback, after closing bug 154030 this behaviour is definiltey worthwhile.  Selections are now retained between the xml source page &lt;-&gt; Extensions/ExtensionPoints pages.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>org.eclipse.gef.internal.ui.properties.PropertySheetEntry doesn't apply property
changes for org.eclipse.jface.viewers.CheckboxCellEditor, since the
CheckboxCellEditor doesn't have a Control, and
PropertySheetEntry.applyEditorValue() returns at line 120 if the editor's
control is null.

This behaviour is not consistent with
org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.PropertySheetEntry, which appears to work
properly with CheckboxCellEditor.
Defect found in 3.1M3
Randy, why was this moved to Platform-UI?  David seems to be describing a
problem in GEF's implementation of PropertySheetEntry.
correct, this is a GEF-specific issue.
He is referring to our copy of the jface class.  JFace has the same bug.  
Anyway, we will subclassing the jface class soon so our copy of the bug is 
irrelevant.
Please clarify, I'm not seeing the problem.

From the opening comment:
"org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.PropertySheetEntry ... appears to work
properly with CheckboxCellEditor."

Also, what do you mean by "the jface class"?  The properties view is in
org.eclipse.ui.views, not JFace.

To be clear: org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.PropertySheetEntry functions
correctly, whereas org.eclipse.gef.internal.ui.properties.PropertySheetEntry
does not.  This is a GEF-specific defect that only occurs when a GEF selection
is made and the property sheet is thusly populated with GEF-based
PropertySheetEntry instances.
My mistake, I suppose our copy is way out of sync with the one in 
eclipse.ui.views. It looks like we were doing a check to avoid multiple 
applications of the same value.  This would go unnoticed in the platform, but 
in GEF causes two redundant commands to be executed.

So, the class that actually has the bug is being deleted soon. This means if we 
were working around something the workaround is going away too.

Sorry for the confusion. I'll open another bug if I see duplicate calls to 
applyEditorValue().

    <WithStack>In this scenario customer had applied and update against WSAD v512/Exclipse
2.1.3 and it resulted in some correuptiobn of the workspace in which the update
was done. Specifically Search-&gt;File only showed 2 tabs and the Customize button
only offerred those same choices....ther should be 5 choices.


The customer asked for this feature:


1. Function/Option to reset a workspace wrt meta-data for               
base/core  eclipse plug-ins to their default                            
values/settings (e.g. Search-&gt;File should show 4 tabs and                
offer 5 "custom" choices) on startup or after startup.                  
This is to accommodate a workspace that has been corrupted.             
This not to be confused with Perspective reset to default               
values.                                                                 
                                                                        
2. Extend 1. to be an api/capability available for all                  
plug-in developers                                                      
                                                                        
3. "1." should be extended to a validator for checking                  
workspace that have or may be corrupt, and offer the option             
to re-set core meta-data/setting to the base default                    
settings
Moving to runtime. This seems to be an issue of the plugin registry being stale
or not properly reflecting the update (search dialog tabs are contributed via
extension point).  I suspect the "-clean" argument in Eclipse 3.0 accomplishes
what is being asked for here.
Using the -clean command line argument has the effect you are looking for in
Eclipse 3.0 or greater.  There is no plan to backport such functionality to
earlier releases.  Please open a new bug report if you find a case where
metadata is still corrupt after starting with -clean.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>an error with a connection arises during an update although everything is ok 
with network and update site; moreover, my workstation is disconnected from 
intranet for cca 1 minute (i.e. you can not ping from the station to some 
neighbor). Local network works Ok (i.e. other stations does not have any 
problem with connection). 
 
We do not have exact case to reproduce or describe the problem configuration, 
unfortunately - the problem has been observed at different PC's or networks (at 
our customer's side). 
 
Mode: 
- Local network update site: 1/ Apache httpd (2.0.49-4) + Apache Tomcat 
(5.0.28), OS: Linux, Windows2000, where Apache httpd is used for download of 
the upgrades, 2/ (other customer =&gt; other network &amp; server node) Apache Tomcat 
(4.1.27), OS: Windows2000 
 
Platform:
- Eclipse3.0
- Java 1.4
- MS Windows 2000 as well as XP
- PC, 10/100MBit Ethernet
Another issue: we have switched to Eclipse3.0.1 &amp; made some changes in our 
code; now, it spent cca 1min with a verification of random plugin, let say 
plugin-X: ping returns time less than 1ms, no interruption during pinging 
arises, processor utilization: less than 1%, network utilization: less than 1% -
 at both: at client as well as at server side; download of next plugin-Y fails 
because of: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out. Results from test 
with local update site (directly from filesystem) using same build of an 
application: it works well including no pause during the plugin-X verification. 
 
Web Server:
Single Apache (2.0.52) used on local network, no proxy is used.
 
Note that update site contains 138 plugins.
Roman, what do you mean by "verification" ? Is it the string that you see in 
the progress monitor ("Verifying blah blah...") ?

Because there are many connections being created (one for each plugin), 
perhaps there is something in the network layer that can't handle. What jre 
are you using? (you only mention 1.4, but not the exact version and provider)

Have you tried a different http server for windows? How about apache/tomcat on 
an xp server?
Dorian,

   about verification: yes, you are right - it means the string in context of 
progress bar.

about JVM: 1/ Sun JVM build 1.4.2_05-b04, 2/ (other test) Sun JVM build 1.5.0-
b64

about http server: I've tested issue no.2 (pause during 
verification/installation =&gt; SocketTimeoutException) with Apache on Linux 
successfully !!? Note that updating using Apache on Win2000 doesn't work yet 
and produces issue no.2 still. Note that I can not say any progress about first 
issue, because it did not indicate regular occurrence.

I should try other http server for windows but I can't see any reason why 
proofed solution like apache doesn't work.
Result of test with Tomcat on Windows: successful. But I can find exceptions in 
context of catalina.log:

Thanks.
The apache server works best on linux (even though it is multiplatform, the 
windows version is probably not as good iis).
The error from Tomcat maybe something that happened, but the server recovered.
You may want to post some question or check the archives at the apache's 
jakarta project to get more info on tomcat errors.

There may be a hidden bug in update, or in the jre itself (some network 
streams not properly closed, etc.), but it is hard to pinpoint what's 
happening. I tried updating the entire eclipse from my local apache http 
server and I had no problems. At some point, I was also copying another very 
large file into the same DocumentRoot folder for the apache http server, in 
which case the whole local network download became very slow. This is no 
related to what you do, but just fyi.
Ok, thanks. I have write Summary of the problem below. If you have any idea 
what should I do next or if you can answer my questions in context of it, would 
be very helpful.  

Summary:
Issue no. 1: 
- description: problem during update leading to complete disconnection of a 
client (when system can do that ??)
- occurrence: unknown (different networks, different clients)

Issue no. 2: 
- description: problem during installation of some plugin, download of the next 
plugin fails with Read timed out.
- occurrence: 
- it doesn't work with a client on Windows XP (2 stations tested)
- it doesn't work on platform SDK 3.0 as well as 3.0.1
- automatic update as well as update made by hand (feature-by-feature) doesn't 
work
- local update site (file system) does work without any problem 
- it doesn't work with Apache on Windows, it does work with Apache on Linux and 
Tomcat on Windows (but: Software caused connection abort: socket write error; 
Q: when such kind of error occurres ?)
- ping between client and server does work on 100% (without any break)
- tested on JVM 1.4 as well as 1.5
- tested on local network
- processor utilization: less than 1%, network utilization: less than 1% 
On issue 2: if feasible, use the os and server (linux/apache) that works, or 
causes the fewest problems

Issue 1: it isn't clear whether the problem still occurs when using 
linux/apache
Dorian,

   the issue no.1 occurred in all tested cases, unfortunately - i.e. 
Apache/Linux as well as Tomcat/Windows. Client for all cases: WindowsXP 

News about issue no.1: it seems there is problem with too many connections - 
remove of one of handles pointing to \Device\Tcp =&gt; ping and other connections 
to local network started to work.
  
I'm not familiar with windows socket I can't tell you information about that in 
detail. 

it seems to me there is a problem with the concept: a download connection per 
plugin (does it mean: 138 plugins =&gt; 138 connections ?). my question: is there 
any possibility to disable that ? (=&gt; only one connection for all.) If it is 
not, then: is there any chance to change it simply in context of source code ? 

All these connections should be happening in a serial fashion. I wonder if 
anything is left open, the so the network layer does not release those 
connection. I will investigate this.
Created attachment 16124
netstat log during an update

there you can see info produced by netstat tool I executed in different states
of an update
Created attachment 16125
an error dialog I can see when an update fails
Thanks for the extra info, that should help.
You may also play with the http server, they usually have settings for the 
number of connections allowed.
Some download code in update is done via threads, but only to be able to 
cancel, in which case the connection dies by itself. I may need to revisit 
that code to see if it can cause your problems.
I would also recommend trying various jdk's, to see if things improve.
I did it, I played with the params like no. of connections - no effect. Then I 
had changed param KeepAlive On -&gt; Off and result was: 1/ the connections in 
state ESTABLISHED erlier was in state CLOSE_WAIT then (represents waiting for a 
connection termination request from the local user) but stay there till 
application close 2/ the error occurred later than in case of the previous set-
up.

I'm worry about long ongoing in state FIN_WAIT_2 you can see in previous log as 
well.

So, it seems to me there is realy hard-core problem at low network level about 
connection finnalization.

I'm going to send other log.

I assume you're running with the latest fix packs, right ?
(or at least as far as networking fixes goes).
do you mean windows service packs or jvm fixes or ?
sorry, meant OS fixes
yes, I do have latest pack, my current OS: Microsoft Windows XP - Professional, 
Version 2002, Service Pack 2.
given all the discussions around service pack 2 for xp, I would have blamed 
that, but you see the problem on win2k, so there must be something else.
I wouldn't rule out bugs in update code, but so far, this is the first time 
we've heard this problem report.
Anyway, I will investigate more, but there are some competing issues that I 
also need to look at, so don't expect a very quick resolution.
thanks!

Without dragging this for too long, so far it looks like the http server does 
not work well on windows, but the update client needs a bit more investigation 
to check that it closes connections. 

Did some searches and found a few interesting docs:
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/README.html#xpbug
http://www.auburn.edu/docs/apache/misc/fin_wait_2.html
I'm also seeing this when trying to install official eclipse.org plugins (like
EMF). I'm running Eclipse 3.1.0 on WinXP/SP2. I tried different mirrors
(SunSITE, eclipse.org, 100MB mirror) to no avail. The update process hangs at
some random point into verifying the downloads.

Is there anything I can do to help track this down?
Hi

I noticed the same bug after installing Eclipse 3.1. Eclipse 3.0 went fine, but
now with Eclipse 3.1 when I want to install new features through the update
manager, my complete network connection hangs after a certain time. That means
that my pc can't connect to anything in the web or the local lan.

The difference to the problem of the bug reporter is, that it happens when im
updating official features like EMF from the official update site. A workaround
is to only update one feature at once, but this works only for small features,
not for EMF. If the network connection is broken I have to kill eclipse and the
connection returns.

Facts:
Eclipse 3.1
Java(TM) 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0 Update 2
WinXP with SP2

Yours sincerely
Michael Reitz
I can also confirm this bug on Windows XP SP2 when searching for updates for all 
features. The network stops working about one minute after starting the update 
process. A connection returns when Eclipse is exited. Both local area 
connections (to shares on local Windows XP and Linux computers) and the Internet 
are lost during this period.

Using Eclipse 3.1.1, Windows XP Service Pack 2, JDK 1.5.0_05. Ethernet 
controller is a Gigabit Marvell Yukon 88E8001/8003/8010 with latest manufacturer 
drivers. Same behavior occurs with Gigabit nVidia nForce NIC. 

I recently bought my current new computer. Before I had the new machine, I never 
had this problem. I have attached my computer's full specs in case it helps.

I think, as mentioned before, this is a problem with too many concurrent open 
connections. Windows XP SP2 restricts the number of TCP connections per second 
to 10. If I recall correctly, I had installed an unoffical patch on my old 
computer that restored the SP1 number of connections per second. I believe this 
was before I started using Eclipse (3.1 betas) on that machine.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 144876 ***
I can also confirm this bug on Windows XP SP2 when performing auto updates using Eclipse SDK 3.2. The network stops working for at least one minute, sometimes longer.

Interesstingly, SSH sessions seem to survive as long as there is no actual traffic going on (dormant shell session).

After reading comment #25 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=79212#c25) in this bug report, I tryed to diagnose something along these lines.

netstat showed, that Eclipse had 25 connections open to our web proxy, with the 25th remaining in SYNC state.

After disabling "Deterministic Network Enhancer" and "QoS Packet Scheduler" in the network connection's properties dialog, Eclipse was able to open at least 50 connections (probably as many as there were feature/plugin jars mentioned in the site.xml for timestamp checks or something) and everything worked like a charm. 

I can't tell, which of the two services/protocols/drivers blocks connection attempts, as I didn't have the time to rule out one of them, but at least it works now. I already thought, I had a hardware failure, phuh....</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>an error with a connection arises during an update although everything is ok 
with network and update site; moreover, my workstation is disconnected from 
intranet for cca 1 minute (i.e. you can not ping from the station to some 
neighbor). Local network works Ok (i.e. other stations does not have any 
problem with connection). 
 
We do not have exact case to reproduce or describe the problem configuration, 
unfortunately - the problem has been observed at different PC's or networks (at 
our customer's side). 
 
Mode: 
- Local network update site: 1/ Apache httpd (2.0.49-4) + Apache Tomcat 
(5.0.28), OS: Linux, Windows2000, where Apache httpd is used for download of 
the upgrades, 2/ (other customer =&gt; other network &amp; server node) Apache Tomcat 
(4.1.27), OS: Windows2000 
 
Platform:
- Eclipse3.0
- Java 1.4
- MS Windows 2000 as well as XP
- PC, 10/100MBit Ethernet
Another issue: we have switched to Eclipse3.0.1 &amp; made some changes in our 
code; now, it spent cca 1min with a verification of random plugin, let say 
plugin-X: ping returns time less than 1ms, no interruption during pinging 
arises, processor utilization: less than 1%, network utilization: less than 1% -
 at both: at client as well as at server side; download of next plugin-Y fails 
because of: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out. Results from test 
with local update site (directly from filesystem) using same build of an 
application: it works well including no pause during the plugin-X verification. 
 
Web Server:
Single Apache (2.0.52) used on local network, no proxy is used.
 
Note that update site contains 138 plugins.
Roman, what do you mean by "verification" ? Is it the string that you see in 
the progress monitor ("Verifying blah blah...") ?

Because there are many connections being created (one for each plugin), 
perhaps there is something in the network layer that can't handle. What jre 
are you using? (you only mention 1.4, but not the exact version and provider)

Have you tried a different http server for windows? How about apache/tomcat on 
an xp server?
Dorian,

   about verification: yes, you are right - it means the string in context of 
progress bar.

about JVM: 1/ Sun JVM build 1.4.2_05-b04, 2/ (other test) Sun JVM build 1.5.0-
b64

about http server: I've tested issue no.2 (pause during 
verification/installation =&gt; SocketTimeoutException) with Apache on Linux 
successfully !!? Note that updating using Apache on Win2000 doesn't work yet 
and produces issue no.2 still. Note that I can not say any progress about first 
issue, because it did not indicate regular occurrence.

I should try other http server for windows but I can't see any reason why 
proofed solution like apache doesn't work.
Result of test with Tomcat on Windows: successful. But I can find exceptions in 
context of catalina.log:

StandardWrapperValve[default]: Servlet.service() for servlet default threw 
exception


Thanks.
The apache server works best on linux (even though it is multiplatform, the 
windows version is probably not as good iis).

    <WithStack>Bug 41840 tells how to hack SWT for 2.1.1 to use Mozilla as browser widget on
Windows. This PR requests that Mozilla becomes officially supported on Windows
(or at least available via a commandline switch).

The instructions from bug 41840 don't work any more, since the files have been
removed in HEAD.

Bug 71301 is related to this (requests that Mozilla is supported in Eclipse SDK).
It would be really great to support mozilla (and/or firefox) in Eclipse. I'm
really used to using "Find as you type", tabs, and other great fetures. Every
time I start the Eclipse Help, I have to deal with the limited functionality of IE.
 
The Windows IE Browser widget and the Linux Mozilla one behave differently. For 
developing real multi platform application with SWT, Mozilla support for 
Windows would be really really interesting for us.

I think a Firefox binding would be even better than the existing Mozilla 
binding.
See bug 72487 for Firefox request

Georgi: regarding tabs, are you referring to the possibility to bring up a 
popup menu when the user right clicks on a hyperlink, with the item "Open Link 
in new Tab" ?
Georgi: a workaround for the Eclipse Help problem: Preferences &gt; Help:
- check "Always use external browsers"
- check "Custom Browser"
- choose your favorite
The Windows Internet Explorer Browser Widged has the following disadvantages 
compared to the Mozilla Widget under Linux:

* it allows right mouse button context menu

* it always shows a grey border around the displayed HTML page (this makes it 
impossible to hide the fact that an application uses HTML internally); if you 
use two Browser widgets next to each other, you will get at least three pixels 
border between the two widgets

* it is possible to drop a "foreign file" to the widget - IE will try to open 
the dropped file - this is very bad if you're using HTML for designing parts of 
the GUI of your application

Janosch,

* simply disable the context Menu with calling 
  browser.setMenu(new Menu(shell, SWT.NONE));

* the gray border may result from the SWT.BORDER stylebit, just call
  the constructor of the Browser widget with "SWT.NONE"

Regards,
Ben
Hi Ben,

* I could disable the context menu the way you described. Thank you very much.

* I am not able to remove the border of the IE browser widget. I'm now trying to
draw it without any layout manager (using setBounds()) and I'm adding the
browser widget with 'new Browser(parent, SWT.NONE)'.

Regards and thanks for your reply,
Janosch
* it is possible to drop a "foreign file" to the widget - IE will try to open 
the dropped file - this is very bad if you're using HTML for designing parts 
of 
the GUI of your application

This was fixed recently. This should not happen with a recent integration 
build.
Janosh, if you still have problems with the border, please attach a 
screenshot. Try a recent integration build - the SWT.BORDER style to 
add/remove the IE 3D border was added sometimes in SWT 3.1.
When using the current version of the MS IE Browser Widget under Windows, the
following problems ARE SOLVED:
* Right mouse button menu can be disabled by browser.setMenu(new Menu(shell,
SWT.NONE));
* No border will be drawn for the browser widget if SWT.BORDER stylebit is not set
* Drag and drop support is not working (which is good because it is often not
wanted - see above)

 =&gt; About IE: This makes the SWT Browser Widget with IE under Windows much more
usable.

 =&gt; About Mozilla-Support on Windows: I still want to vote for the Mozilla
support because Mozilla is "free" and it is "multiplatform". To be able to use a
Mozilla-based Browser widget under Linux and Windows would save development time
because the rendering and JavaScript engine is (almost) equal then.
Concurrent instances of Mozilla and IE embedded browsers should be supported on
Windows. 
I don't know if this is the correct way to influence the development of a more 
robust Browser implementation in SWT or not.  I suspect that I ought to be 
providing some formal enhancement request, but having reviewed the various 
postings concerning *some* of the issues, it is clear that you and the other 
people monitoring this forum are aware of and thinking about the issues. So, I 
would like to add a perspective.

Simply having the ability to embed a Mozilla- or Foxfire-based browser instance 
is not enough.  Most of us are on the trail of 'the rich client' and that means 
integrating a lot of nice capability beyond the rendering of &lt;html&gt; pages.  The 
very first level of integration requirement is that all the javascript that we 
have used to enhance those &lt;html&gt; pages has to communicate -- forwards and 
backwards -- with the SWT application.  Granted the present &lt;form&gt; has 
limitations, but the drop-down boxes are there and the calls to our functions 
to modify a selection prior to a submit() are there.  Sometimes we need to grab 
that selection in the SWT application and interceping the StatusText string and 
parsing name-value pairs is just plain wrong.  We need a proper protocol for 
binding data from the embedded scripting language into our java code.

The second level of integration is that we really want to embedd &lt;svg&gt;&lt;script&gt; 
in that &lt;xhtml&gt; page and now I need to be sure that I can communicate -- in 
both directions -- with those controls, those events and those functions.  
Forgetting SWT, today there is no cross-platform way to get the parent script 
engine to properly communicate with the embedded script engine.  We want to 
activate a SWT button and have the action percolate all the way down to 
altering the animation behavior of the &lt;circle&gt; inside the &lt;svg&gt;.  As nice as 
SWT's widgets look, I'm sorry, they are not what you can do with &lt;svg&gt; in terms 
of really energizing your current web applications.

I have been working on trying to solve the &lt;svg&gt; embedding so the absurdities 
of not having standards and protocols is fresh in my mind, but I really should 
be doing the same thing with &lt;xforms&gt; -- they are here now, you know.  We 
really should be doing the same separation of model, view and control of our 
forms with this better solution, but it introduces the same problem.  How do I 
populate &lt;xform&gt; content from my SWT application code; how do I retrieve 
&lt;xform&gt; content in my SWT application?

So, don't get me wrong; I wouldn't want to do anything to impede any progress 
towards improving on what you have given us with the current Browser. But, once 
or twice, your reply to a posting has been "... can you tell us what you want 
to do that for ..."  So, what 'I want to do this stuff for' is that the ASP.NET 
Longhorn army is marching right down on our J2EE Servlets with answers to the 
question of how best to partition between client-side and server-side, how best 
to capitalize on the User Interface by enabling images, videos and audio to 
engage the end-user.  The Mozilla army has infrastructure for doing most of 
the 'good things' that we need to do, but it is a lot more than simply tickling 
the rendering engine to get better looking stuff on the screen.  I would like 
to see the SWT.Browser project address full-function, two-way data and control 
flow between the application and the 'contained browser'.
&gt; I don't know if this is the correct way to influence
Feedback and use cases are always good. You can open a bugzilla report with 
the 'enhancement' flag. They always influence developers working in these 
components - even if we all understand each new feature has a specific 
implementation and maintainance cost attached to it and may not make it when 
these are considered versus the benefits. Another way if you have already 
invested massive amounts of work producing solid extensions to existing 
components is to contribute them to the Eclipse project.

So in your case, I'd recommend you open a separate bug report (just paste your 
comment) and provide details on the SVG and XForm cases. We can pursue from 
there. You can also mention there if you'd rather have specific 
IE/longhorn/.NET extensions to the Windows Browser implementation (a little 
bit like SWT OLE) and lose these features on Linux and the Mac, ie. in 
addition to the portable SWT Browser API, have specific extensions for 
IE/Mozilla/Safari - which would trade portability for functionality.

If/when you open the new PR, please paste its number here so that people 
interested here can follow up to the new PR. Thanks!
I'm adding myself to the cc list because I was also looking for an option to use
the mozilla/firefox/gecko browser widget under Windows. I have two reasons,
first I just like some of the rendering and security benefits, and second
(probably more importantly), I don't have convenient access to a Linux machine
and would like to be able to easily switch back and forth for testing. For that
second reason it "would be nice" that, if there was an option, it didn't require
the workbench to be restarted when you change it. Also it "would be nice" if I
could bind the switch to a key. I don't mind if I have to close and reopen any
existing windows that use the browser widget.

I also am intrigued by the possiblities in comment #11 so if there is a new
bugzilla opened to track that please post the number.

Yes, Yes, Yes!! I've been searching for months for the proper solution to use 
as a "Rich Client".  I've bounced back and forth between what I WANTED to do 
initially (SVG + XForms), to straight web apps, and I think I've finally 
settled on giving Eclipse RCP a go. Using the browser widget will get me back 
to some of the simple form rendering I wanted to do, but the idea of using 
Mozilla, with its support for XUL, soon to come SVG, etc. might open the door 
back up for some really interesting rich clients.  Having part of the client 
be SWT when custom code is warranted, but many other aspects of the client be 
simply "open up a browser window, and get an interface rendered by the server 
using [put your favorite XML based technology here]" would make for quite the 
robust app.  I've added myself to the cc list also.  As I progress further 
with this experiment, I may find myself joining in to make this happen.

*** Bug 83065 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
See bug 58360.  The last attachment there is an Eclipse fragment for
org.eclpse.swt that provides a MozillaBrowser widget for Windows.  It is based
on the Eclipse 3.0.2 version of the gtk Browser widget.  It works only with
Mozilla 1.4.x.  
Is this a dup of bug 58360? Or vice-versa?
*** Bug 58360 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 120422 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
By definition, the Browser widget of SWT is the native browser widget for the
platform.  For example, on Windows it is IE.  So, I am converting this request into one for a new widget based only on Mozilla.

Probably the best design would be to have a minimal SWT Mozilla binding
control, allowing clients to then speak directly to a generic XPCOM Java
binding.

Note that this would be dependent on a XULRunner or other embeddable Mozilla installed on each platform.  Firefox as shipped from mozilla.org is statically linked and not usable for embedding.
I fully support this. As long as the binding is done in such a way that it would allow much greater control than the current SWT Browser widget.

The main features I'd like to see would be:
* Full control over browser content. Including access to browser DOM tree and event model.
* Full control over browser internals (preferences, extensions, window spawning/blocking, coockie handling, etc.)

It might not come all at once but the separate support for Mozilla component would *only* make sense if it would provide more features and control than a native browser component support.


Having the same rendering engine for all platforms would ease cross-platform portability for html-based RCP applications.
Note that Bug 120422 is not a dup of this bug and that has been corrected:

- Bug 79213 (this bug) would require the user to have Mozilla (or possibly Firefox) already installed in order to access it.

- Bug 120422 would ship enough of Mozilla/Firefox in a plug-in so the user would not have to install anything else.
Ed, why push this point if there isn't even an implementation yet for all platforms?
Sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy. I just want to make sure people are clear on what the bugzilla entries mean so there won't be a repeat of what happened to bug 72487 .

Mozilla SWT fragment

This should be a good starting point for you guys.  This is an SWT fragment project that embeds Mozilla in an SWT widget.

* Code is based on existing SWT/Linux Mozilla code, and the old SWT/Win32 Mozilla code, before it was removed.  It's based on an older version, so missing many changes that went into CVS towards the end of 2005.
* Makes use of JavaXPCOM component (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaXPCOM) and XULRunner (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner).  XULRunner is the new "GRE" for Mozilla, and registers itself with the platform.  JavaXPCOM is a Java API for Mozilla, which makes the embedding code much cleaner, and gets rid of JNI code in the embedding code.
* Right now, supports Linux and Win32; haven't had time to work on Mac OS X.
* Platform specific code is split into separate files, so you need to copy the appropriate ".classpath_XXX" file to ".classpath".  If anyone can think of a better way to do this, please let me know.

I wrote the JavaXPCOM code, so if you have suggestions, please let me know.

I don't work with SWT or Eclipse code often, so it would be best if someone here who is more knowledgable could take this code and start working with it.  I'd be happy to help out with the JavaXPCOM and Mozilla interactions.
I'd like to get this to work and can help you with the Eclipse-side stuff.

It would be very helpful for me if I could just get some jars from you that contain whatever else I need from the Mozilla projects.
As mentioned previously, this code depends on XULRunner and its JavaXPCOM component.  The XULRunner releases can be found here: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.0.1.  This needs to be installed according to the release notes (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner_1.8.0.1_Release_Notes).  You will then need to add the MozillaInterfaces.jar file to your build path;  this jar is available in the xulrunner/sdk/lib directory.  If you prefer, the jar is available as a plugin here: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.0.1/eclipse/org.mozilla.xpcom_1.8.0.1.jar.
How is the Ajax toolkit going to handle this? Supposedly it will come with "an embedded Mozilla web browser" (http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/atf/).
The AJAX Toolkit Framework is currently using this code to embed Mozilla on Win32 and Linux.  But that project isn't the correct place for this code; it should be its own project.
OK Javier, it looks like I've got this to work.  After installing the plugins and installing and registering XULRunner, I am able to create an SWT shell, embed a MozillaBrowser in it, and navigate to a URL.

I'd like to try to use tabs, and I was hoping that there would be a simple interface for me to use them.  But is that something I should be doing by writing some XUL?
No, tabs are a "front end" construct, and as such, the MozillaBrowser class would need to be extended to support tabs.
(In reply to comment #26)

Hello,

This is another version of the mozilla-swt widget over javaxpcom bindings.

*) I've created it from one of the earlier snapshots of the Javier's code.
*) During implementation I've compared it with the 3.0.x version of the 
   Mozilla/Linux Browser SWT widget and merged all new fixes.
*) Among others, I've added also profiles support and fixed https support.
*) It does not use yet the xul-runner, but mozilla binaries (1.7.x)

We've agreed with Javier to merge our implementations. Once completed
I'll reattach the merged code.

I'm working on a project that is heavily using this mozilla/swt integration,
so our interest is to maintain/support the widget for a long period.

Therefore, we are hoping to get the CVS home for the widget soon :)

Mozilla SWT fragment (alternative)
(In reply to comment #34)

the related javaxpcom patches have been posted in Mozilla CVS as Bug #332869
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332869)

(In reply to comment #14) and hoping I'm on the right Bug discussion

Our compagny would like to have a Browser plugin based on Firefox or Gecko. And we'll work on it. Help is welcome ! The reasons follows :
- We're looking for a rich client platform to integrate our existing web based solutions and provide more user experience in our future products, so, 
- We want a unique browser implementation through all platforms
- We want Java/Eclipse to interact with DOM to simulate user interaction on the web pages
- We also want Java/Eclipse to listen to DOM events to react to user input and monitor what's happening
- Have a full support for browser preferences
- We do not want the user to be forced to have a particular software on their computer other than Java (no Firefox/Mozilla installation is needed)

Thus we should provide a way to do the following :
- Implement automated test case tools to test our web based solutions by simulating web user interaction with Java
- Cut down development costs with graphical design ( CSS, Javascript and co. does not have to care about IE but just follow standards )
- Focus on a particular version of the browser so we do not need to handle all differences between browsers (version of CSS or Javascript supported for example) and so reducing compatibility tests and development costs
- Extend the time between new browser versions so we can rely on a stable/choosen releases (so we are not dependent on a new IE release, a Windows update, custom installed browser...)
- use most of the technology provided by mozilla/firefox that IE can not handle (SVG, best XML/XSLT support...)
- force client side graphical issues by locking browser preferences towards our web based products so that browser extreme user configurations have no consequences on rendering and usage (so reducing maintenance and hotline)
- tightly integrate our new Rich Client products with existing web based applications by providing hot interaction between the browser and the rest of the application
- ship a package that we are known to work on every platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) without thinking about OS differences and OS installation related stuff
- have multiple Views in Eclipse based on a same opened session on a web application (nowadays, each view is another browser instance, so we can't share sessions for example, in a clean way)

Hope that'll help to understand our motivations and give you an idea of what an embbeded browser component can provide (more that displaying web pages).

Help is needed for this. Hope some of you will understand. Please contribute to this discussion, and forgive me for my so bad english !
As a follow-up to comment 36, and all of the other requests for this, this is something that SWT is planning for the 3.3 timeframe.

(In reply to comment #37)

Is there some public (even if halfway done) spec of planned features for this Mozilla/Fx component? Or some public space (like wiki) where ideas and requirements for it would be fleshed out by community?

(This bug is getting rather long)
There's nothing formally written on this.  Informally, the plan is to base it on the attachments in comment 26 and comment 34.  JavaXPCOM will be used and exposed so that a client can make XPCOM calls from java in order to use mozilla's available facilities.

&gt; As a follow-up to comment 36, and all of the other requests for this, this is
&gt; something that SWT is planning for the 3.3 timeframe.
Grany:
I saw that in the plan that excellent.
May I ask if MacOS will be supported too?
Traditionally all the work I have here, on ATF and elsewhere was focused on Win32 and Linux/GTK only.

MacOS support would be important.


Yes, OS X support is mandatory if this is going to join the swt project proper, which is the plan currently.

*** Bug 57477 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The first part of this work is released, the Mozilla GRE can now be used to render Browser contents on win32 and OS X if a XULRunner is installed and registered on the machine.  To specify that this should be used just create your Browser with style SWT.MOZILLA.

Note that there are some specific version requirements to run this on OS X that do not apply to windows or linux:

- on OS X your jre must be "Java for Mac OS X 10.4, Release 5 Developer Preview 2", which is available on Apple Developer Connection ( http://connect.apple.com/ ) (registration is free)

- on OS X your XULRunner must currently be a 1.9 stream build, such as http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/nightly/latest-trunk/xulrunner-1.9a2pre.en-US.mac-pkg.dmg
  -&gt; note that a future 1.8.x stream build of XULRunner may have support for this on OS X; if this build becomes available then a comment will be added here with a link to it

- on windows and linux you can use any jre and XULRunner version

We are actively investigating bug 162942 which prevents focus from being given to a text field by clicking on it.  The user workaround for now is to tab into the text field.

The second part of this work (binding JavaXPCOM to a Browser instance) is logged as bug 173117.

Shouldn't General / Web Browser preference page allow to choose between IE and Mozilla as an internal web browser?
sure, I've logged bug 173128

If you're on Linux/GTK and seeing the browser take excessive memory with M5, see bug 173782 for comments on the problem and a work-around.
I forgot to update this report, OSX users no longer need to use a 1.9 stream build of xulrunner, they can use xulrunner 1.8.1.3 (this is a real release). It's available at http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.1.3/contrib/</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Bug 41840 tells how to hack SWT for 2.1.1 to use Mozilla as browser widget on
Windows. This PR requests that Mozilla becomes officially supported on Windows
(or at least available via a commandline switch).

The instructions from bug 41840 don't work any more, since the files have been
removed in HEAD.

Bug 71301 is related to this (requests that Mozilla is supported in Eclipse SDK).
It would be really great to support mozilla (and/or firefox) in Eclipse. I'm
really used to using "Find as you type", tabs, and other great fetures. Every
time I start the Eclipse Help, I have to deal with the limited functionality of IE.
 
The Windows IE Browser widget and the Linux Mozilla one behave differently. For 
developing real multi platform application with SWT, Mozilla support for 
Windows would be really really interesting for us.

I think a Firefox binding would be even better than the existing Mozilla 
binding.
See bug 72487 for Firefox request

Georgi: regarding tabs, are you referring to the possibility to bring up a 
popup menu when the user right clicks on a hyperlink, with the item "Open Link 
in new Tab" ?
Georgi: a workaround for the Eclipse Help problem: Preferences &gt; Help:
- check "Always use external browsers"
- check "Custom Browser"
- choose your favorite
The Windows Internet Explorer Browser Widged has the following disadvantages 
compared to the Mozilla Widget under Linux:

* it allows right mouse button context menu

* it always shows a grey border around the displayed HTML page (this makes it 
impossible to hide the fact that an application uses HTML internally); if you 
use two Browser widgets next to each other, you will get at least three pixels 
border between the two widgets

* it is possible to drop a "foreign file" to the widget - IE will try to open 
the dropped file - this is very bad if you're using HTML for designing parts of 
the GUI of your application

Janosch,

* simply disable the context Menu with calling 
  browser.setMenu(new Menu(shell, SWT.NONE));

* the gray border may result from the SWT.BORDER stylebit, just call
  the constructor of the Browser widget with "SWT.NONE"

Regards,
Ben
Hi Ben,

* I could disable the context menu the way you described. Thank you very much.

* I am not able to remove the border of the IE browser widget. I'm now trying to
draw it without any layout manager (using setBounds()) and I'm adding the
browser widget with 'new Browser(parent, SWT.NONE)'.

Regards and thanks for your reply,
Janosch
* it is possible to drop a "foreign file" to the widget - IE will try to open 
the dropped file - this is very bad if you're using HTML for designing parts 
of 
the GUI of your application

This was fixed recently. This should not happen with a recent integration 
build.
Janosh, if you still have problems with the border, please attach a 
screenshot. Try a recent integration build - the SWT.BORDER style to 
add/remove the IE 3D border was added sometimes in SWT 3.1.
When using the current version of the MS IE Browser Widget under Windows, the
following problems ARE SOLVED:
* Right mouse button menu can be disabled by browser.setMenu(new Menu(shell,
SWT.NONE));
* No border will be drawn for the browser widget if SWT.BORDER stylebit is not set
* Drag and drop support is not working (which is good because it is often not
wanted - see above)

 =&gt; About IE: This makes the SWT Browser Widget with IE under Windows much more
usable.

 =&gt; About Mozilla-Support on Windows: I still want to vote for the Mozilla
support because Mozilla is "free" and it is "multiplatform". To be able to use a
Mozilla-based Browser widget under Linux and Windows would save development time
because the rendering and JavaScript engine is (almost) equal then.
Concurrent instances of Mozilla and IE embedded browsers should be supported on
Windows. 
I don't know if this is the correct way to influence the development of a more 
robust Browser implementation in SWT or not.  I suspect that I ought to be 
providing some formal enhancement request, but having reviewed the various 
postings concerning *some* of the issues, it is clear that you and the other 
people monitoring this forum are aware of and thinking about the issues. So, I 
would like to add a perspective.

Simply having the ability to embed a Mozilla- or Foxfire-based browser instance 
is not enough.  Most of us are on the trail of 'the rich client' and that means 
integrating a lot of nice capability beyond the rendering of &lt;html&gt; pages.  The 
very first level of integration requirement is that all the javascript that we 
have used to enhance those &lt;html&gt; pages has to communicate -- forwards and 
backwards -- with the SWT application.  Granted the present &lt;form&gt; has 
limitations, but the drop-down boxes are there and the calls to our functions 
to modify a selection prior to a submit() are there.  Sometimes we need to grab 
that selection in the SWT application and interceping the StatusText string and 
parsing name-value pairs is just plain wrong.  We need a proper protocol for 
binding data from the embedded scripting language into our java code.

The second level of integration is that we really want to embedd &lt;svg&gt;&lt;script&gt; 
in that &lt;xhtml&gt; page and now I need to be sure that I can communicate -- in 
both directions -- with those controls, those events and those functions.  
Forgetting SWT, today there is no cross-platform way to get the parent script 
engine to properly communicate with the embedded script engine.  We want to 
activate a SWT button and have the action percolate all the way down to 
altering the animation behavior of the &lt;circle&gt; inside the &lt;svg&gt;.  As nice as 
SWT's widgets look, I'm sorry, they are not what you can do with &lt;svg&gt; in terms 
of really energizing your current web applications.

I have been working on trying to solve the &lt;svg&gt; embedding so the absurdities 
of not having standards and protocols is fresh in my mind, but I really should 
be doing the same thing with &lt;xforms&gt; -- they are here now, you know.  We 
really should be doing the same separation of model, view and control of our 
forms with this better solution, but it introduces the same problem.  How do I 
populate &lt;xform&gt; content from my SWT application code; how do I retrieve 
&lt;xform&gt; content in my SWT application?

So, don't get me wrong; I wouldn't want to do anything to impede any progress 
towards improving on what you have given us with the current Browser. But, once 
or twice, your reply to a posting has been "... can you tell us what you want 
to do that for ..."  So, what 'I want to do this stuff for' is that the ASP.NET 
Longhorn army is marching right down on our J2EE Servlets with answers to the 
question of how best to partition between client-side and server-side, how best 
to capitalize on the User Interface by enabling images, videos and audio to 
engage the end-user.  The Mozilla army has infrastructure for doing most of 
the 'good things' that we need to do, but it is a lot more than simply tickling 
the rendering engine to get better looking stuff on the screen.  I would like 
to see the SWT.Browser project address full-function, two-way data and control 
flow between the application and the 'contained browser'.
&gt; I don't know if this is the correct way to influence
Feedback and use cases are always good. You can open a bugzilla report with 
the 'enhancement' flag. They always influence developers working in these 
components - even if we all understand each new feature has a specific 
implementation and maintainance cost attached to it and may not make it when 
these are considered versus the benefits. Another way if you have already 
invested massive amounts of work producing solid extensions to existing 
components is to contribute them to the Eclipse project.

So in your case, I'd recommend you open a separate bug report (just paste your 
comment) and provide details on the SVG and XForm cases. We can pursue from 
there. You can also mention there if you'd rather have specific 
IE/longhorn/.NET extensions to the Windows Browser implementation (a little 
bit like SWT OLE) and lose these features on Linux and the Mac, ie. in 
addition to the portable SWT Browser API, have specific extensions for 
IE/Mozilla/Safari - which would trade portability for functionality.

If/when you open the new PR, please paste its number here so that people 
interested here can follow up to the new PR. Thanks!
I'm adding myself to the cc list because I was also looking for an option to use
the mozilla/firefox/gecko browser widget under Windows. I have two reasons,
first I just like some of the rendering and security benefits, and second
(probably more importantly), I don't have convenient access to a Linux machine
and would like to be able to easily switch back and forth for testing. For that
second reason it "would be nice" that, if there was an option, it didn't require
the workbench to be restarted when you change it. Also it "would be nice" if I
could bind the switch to a key. I don't mind if I have to close and reopen any
existing windows that use the browser widget.

I also am intrigued by the possiblities in comment #11 so if there is a new
bugzilla opened to track that please post the number.

Yes, Yes, Yes!! I've been searching for months for the proper solution to use 
as a "Rich Client".  I've bounced back and forth between what I WANTED to do 
initially (SVG + XForms), to straight web apps, and I think I've finally 
settled on giving Eclipse RCP a go. Using the browser widget will get me back 
to some of the simple form rendering I wanted to do, but the idea of using 
Mozilla, with its support for XUL, soon to come SVG, etc. might open the door 
back up for some really interesting rich clients.  Having part of the client 
be SWT when custom code is warranted, but many other aspects of the client be 
simply "open up a browser window, and get an interface rendered by the server 
using [put your favorite XML based technology here]" would make for quite the 
robust app.  I've added myself to the cc list also.  As I progress further 
with this experiment, I may find myself joining in to make this happen.

See bug 58360.  The last attachment there is an Eclipse fragment for
org.eclpse.swt that provides a MozillaBrowser widget for Windows.  It is based
on the Eclipse 3.0.2 version of the gtk Browser widget.  It works only with
Mozilla 1.4.x.  
Is this a dup of bug 58360? Or vice-versa?
*** Bug 58360 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 120422 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
By definition, the Browser widget of SWT is the native browser widget for the
platform.  For example, on Windows it is IE.  So, I am converting this request into one for a new widget based only on Mozilla.

Probably the best design would be to have a minimal SWT Mozilla binding
control, allowing clients to then speak directly to a generic XPCOM Java
binding.

Note that this would be dependent on a XULRunner or other embeddable Mozilla installed on each platform.  Firefox as shipped from mozilla.org is statically linked and not usable for embedding.
I fully support this. As long as the binding is done in such a way that it would allow much greater control than the current SWT Browser widget.

The main features I'd like to see would be:
* Full control over browser content. Including access to browser DOM tree and event model.
* Full control over browser internals (preferences, extensions, window spawning/blocking, coockie handling, etc.)

It might not come all at once but the separate support for Mozilla component would *only* make sense if it would provide more features and control than a native browser component support.


Having the same rendering engine for all platforms would ease cross-platform portability for html-based RCP applications.
Note that Bug 120422 is not a dup of this bug and that has been corrected:

- Bug 79213 (this bug) would require the user to have Mozilla (or possibly Firefox) already installed in order to access it.

- Bug 120422 would ship enough of Mozilla/Firefox in a plug-in so the user would not have to install anything else.
Ed, why push this point if there isn't even an implementation yet for all platforms?
Sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy. I just want to make sure people are clear on what the bugzilla entries mean so there won't be a repeat of what happened to bug 72487 .

Mozilla SWT fragment

This should be a good starting point for you guys.  This is an SWT fragment project that embeds Mozilla in an SWT widget.

* Code is based on existing SWT/Linux Mozilla code, and the old SWT/Win32 Mozilla code, before it was removed.  It's based on an older version, so missing many changes that went into CVS towards the end of 2005.
* Makes use of JavaXPCOM component (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaXPCOM) and XULRunner (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner).  XULRunner is the new "GRE" for Mozilla, and registers itself with the platform.  JavaXPCOM is a Java API for Mozilla, which makes the embedding code much cleaner, and gets rid of JNI code in the embedding code.
* Right now, supports Linux and Win32; haven't had time to work on Mac OS X.
* Platform specific code is split into separate files, so you need to copy the appropriate ".classpath_XXX" file to ".classpath".  If anyone can think of a better way to do this, please let me know.

I wrote the JavaXPCOM code, so if you have suggestions, please let me know.

I don't work with SWT or Eclipse code often, so it would be best if someone here who is more knowledgable could take this code and start working with it.  I'd be happy to help out with the JavaXPCOM and Mozilla interactions.
I'd like to get this to work and can help you with the Eclipse-side stuff.

It would be very helpful for me if I could just get some jars from you that contain whatever else I need from the Mozilla projects.
As mentioned previously, this code depends on XULRunner and its JavaXPCOM component.  The XULRunner releases can be found here: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.0.1.  This needs to be installed according to the release notes (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner_1.8.0.1_Release_Notes).  You will then need to add the MozillaInterfaces.jar file to your build path;  this jar is available in the xulrunner/sdk/lib directory.  If you prefer, the jar is available as a plugin here: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.0.1/eclipse/org.mozilla.xpcom_1.8.0.1.jar.
How is the Ajax toolkit going to handle this? Supposedly it will come with "an embedded Mozilla web browser" (http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/atf/).
The AJAX Toolkit Framework is currently using this code to embed Mozilla on Win32 and Linux.  But that project isn't the correct place for this code; it should be its own project.
OK Javier, it looks like I've got this to work.  After installing the plugins and installing and registering XULRunner, I am able to create an SWT shell, embed a MozillaBrowser in it, and navigate to a URL.

I'd like to try to use tabs, and I was hoping that there would be a simple interface for me to use them.  But is that something I should be doing by writing some XUL?
No, tabs are a "front end" construct, and as such, the MozillaBrowser class would need to be extended to support tabs.
(In reply to comment #26)

Hello,

This is another version of the mozilla-swt widget over javaxpcom bindings.

*) I've created it from one of the earlier snapshots of the Javier's code.
*) During implementation I've compared it with the 3.0.x version of the 
   Mozilla/Linux Browser SWT widget and merged all new fixes.
*) Among others, I've added also profiles support and fixed https support.
*) It does not use yet the xul-runner, but mozilla binaries (1.7.x)

We've agreed with Javier to merge our implementations. Once completed
I'll reattach the merged code.

I'm working on a project that is heavily using this mozilla/swt integration,
so our interest is to maintain/support the widget for a long period.

Therefore, we are hoping to get the CVS home for the widget soon :)

Mozilla SWT fragment (alternative)
(In reply to comment #34)

the related javaxpcom patches have been posted in Mozilla CVS as Bug #332869
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332869)

(In reply to comment #14) and hoping I'm on the right Bug discussion

Our compagny would like to have a Browser plugin based on Firefox or Gecko. And we'll work on it. Help is welcome ! The reasons follows :
- We're looking for a rich client platform to integrate our existing web based solutions and provide more user experience in our future products, so, 
- We want a unique browser implementation through all platforms
- We want Java/Eclipse to interact with DOM to simulate user interaction on the web pages
- We also want Java/Eclipse to listen to DOM events to react to user input and monitor what's happening
- Have a full support for browser preferences
- We do not want the user to be forced to have a particular software on their computer other than Java (no Firefox/Mozilla installation is needed)

Thus we should provide a way to do the following :
- Implement automated test case tools to test our web based solutions by simulating web user interaction with Java
- Cut down development costs with graphical design ( CSS, Javascript and co. does not have to care about IE but just follow standards )
- Focus on a particular version of the browser so we do not need to handle all differences between browsers (version of CSS or Javascript supported for example) and so reducing compatibility tests and development costs
- Extend the time between new browser versions so we can rely on a stable/choosen releases (so we are not dependent on a new IE release, a Windows update, custom installed browser...)
- use most of the technology provided by mozilla/firefox that IE can not handle (SVG, best XML/XSLT support...)
- force client side graphical issues by locking browser preferences towards our web based products so that browser extreme user configurations have no consequences on rendering and usage (so reducing maintenance and hotline)
- tightly integrate our new Rich Client products with existing web based applications by providing hot interaction between the browser and the rest of the application
- ship a package that we are known to work on every platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) without thinking about OS differences and OS installation related stuff
- have multiple Views in Eclipse based on a same opened session on a web application (nowadays, each view is another browser instance, so we can't share sessions for example, in a clean way)

Hope that'll help to understand our motivations and give you an idea of what an embbeded browser component can provide (more that displaying web pages).

Help is needed for this. Hope some of you will understand. Please contribute to this discussion, and forgive me for my so bad english !
As a follow-up to comment 36, and all of the other requests for this, this is something that SWT is planning for the 3.3 timeframe.

(In reply to comment #37)

Is there some public (even if halfway done) spec of planned features for this Mozilla/Fx component? Or some public space (like wiki) where ideas and requirements for it would be fleshed out by community?

(This bug is getting rather long)
There's nothing formally written on this.  Informally, the plan is to base it on the attachments in comment 26 and comment 34.  JavaXPCOM will be used and exposed so that a client can make XPCOM calls from java in order to use mozilla's available facilities.

I have try to the "java.library.path" property to the xulrunner folder where there is file "javaxpcom.jar". But it does not help. Of crouse I dont have "javaxpcom.dll" (I even can not find it on internet).

I have your "javaxpcom" patch. But I dont know how to compile it.

Could you please help me to make it work.

&gt; As a follow-up to comment 36, and all of the other requests for this, this is
&gt; something that SWT is planning for the 3.3 timeframe.
Grany:
I saw that in the plan that excellent.
May I ask if MacOS will be supported too?
Traditionally all the work I have here, on ATF and elsewhere was focused on Win32 and Linux/GTK only.

MacOS support would be important.


Yes, OS X support is mandatory if this is going to join the swt project proper, which is the plan currently.

*** Bug 57477 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The first part of this work is released, the Mozilla GRE can now be used to render Browser contents on win32 and OS X if a XULRunner is installed and registered on the machine.  To specify that this should be used just create your Browser with style SWT.MOZILLA.

Note that there are some specific version requirements to run this on OS X that do not apply to windows or linux:

- on OS X your jre must be "Java for Mac OS X 10.4, Release 5 Developer Preview 2", which is available on Apple Developer Connection ( http://connect.apple.com/ ) (registration is free)

- on OS X your XULRunner must currently be a 1.9 stream build, such as http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/nightly/latest-trunk/xulrunner-1.9a2pre.en-US.mac-pkg.dmg
  -&gt; note that a future 1.8.x stream build of XULRunner may have support for this on OS X; if this build becomes available then a comment will be added here with a link to it

- on windows and linux you can use any jre and XULRunner version

We are actively investigating bug 162942 which prevents focus from being given to a text field by clicking on it.  The user workaround for now is to tab into the text field.

The second part of this work (binding JavaXPCOM to a Browser instance) is logged as bug 173117.

Shouldn't General / Web Browser preference page allow to choose between IE and Mozilla as an internal web browser?
sure, I've logged bug 173128

*** Bug 78048 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
If you're on Linux/GTK and seeing the browser take excessive memory with M5, see bug 173782 for comments on the problem and a work-around.
I forgot to update this report, OSX users no longer need to use a 1.9 stream build of xulrunner, they can use xulrunner 1.8.1.3 (this is a real release). It's available at http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.1.3/contrib/</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>1. Open two workbenches running at the same time.
2. Attach to an agent in one of the workbenches.
3. Go to the attach wizard in the other workbench, the agent shows up, but 
should not.

The agent does not show up if we go to the attach wizard in the same workbench 
where we attached to the agent.

I also tested this with an older Hyades driver (20040830_2107).  I saw the same 
issue.
This is causing crashing in higher products when two users attempt to monitor 
the same agent. This is a must-fix.

One question, can you go ahead to attach to the agent inside the 2nd workbench? 
It should throw back an exception saying that it is already attached and the 
workbnech is properly handling the exception (except that it should not show 
the "Attached" icon in the Profiling Monitor view. it should show 
the "Detached" icon instead). The listAgents() call by design is to show all 
agents, both attached or detached ones.
I remember this behaviour.  I was not actually able to attach to an allready 
attached agent.  The problem was with the agent being visible, to be selected, 
to attempt an attach.
Terry, since this duo-attach scenario is being correctly handled by the 
RAC/workbench (you can't attach from the 2nd workbench since an exception was 
thrown) I will return this as "working as designed".

Since you can't attach twice, you will not be able to start monioring from both 
workbenches as described by Curtis. I hope the workbench side should not allow 
the "start monitoring" operation when an agent is not attached.
My earlier post was a little misleading. Currently it does let you attach two 
workbenches to the same user, but it *shouldn't*. The query to the agent to see 
if it was attached or not (isAttached() ?) was returning false, while it was 
actually true. So the workbench has no way to know whether it should let the 
user attach or not.
The AgentImpl.isAttach() will return a local copy of the isAttached flag. 
Please use the AgentImpl.isAttached(boolean remote) to perform a remote query 
of the isAttached status. So you can call AgentImpl.isAttached(true) to get the 
most up-to-date status of the agent. For legacy support, we cannot change the 
null arg isAttach() method to use the remote query.
Please investigate, Terry.
Terry, if the workaround specified by Terry fixes the problem please go ahead 
and implement it.
After that move the defect back to Samson. The problem is still valid and needs 
to be addressed by the agent controller layer
Fix submitted.

    <WithOutStack>1. Open two workbenches running at the same time.
2. Attach to an agent in one of the workbenches.
3. Go to the attach wizard in the other workbench, the agent shows up, but 
should not.

The agent does not show up if we go to the attach wizard in the same workbench 
where we attached to the agent.

I also tested this with an older Hyades driver (20040830_2107).  I saw the same 
issue.
This is causing crashing in higher products when two users attempt to monitor 
the same agent. This is a must-fix.

One question, can you go ahead to attach to the agent inside the 2nd workbench? 
It should throw back an exception saying that it is already attached and the 
workbnech is properly handling the exception (except that it should not show 
the "Attached" icon in the Profiling Monitor view. it should show 
the "Detached" icon instead). The listAgents() call by design is to show all 
agents, both attached or detached ones.
I remember this behaviour.  I was not actually able to attach to an allready 
attached agent.  The problem was with the agent being visible, to be selected, 
to attempt an attach.
Terry, since this duo-attach scenario is being correctly handled by the 
RAC/workbench (you can't attach from the 2nd workbench since an exception was 
thrown) I will return this as "working as designed".

    <WithStack>on Windows, if you attach a dragdetect listener, you'll get one fewer selection 
event.

In control example, go to the sash tab
- attach mousedown, mouseup, and selection listeners.
- press down and up on a sash.
you'll get the following events:

Selection: SelectionEvent{Sash {} time=604321406 data=null item=null detail=1 
x=0 y=144 width=563 height=3 stateMask=0 doit=true}
MouseDown: MouseEvent{Sash {} time=604321406 data=null button=1 stateMask=0 
x=180 y=2}
Selection: SelectionEvent{Sash {} time=604321484 data=null item=null detail=0 
x=0 y=144 width=563 height=3 stateMask=0 doit=true}
MouseUp: MouseEvent{Sash {} time=604321484 data=null button=1 stateMask=524288 
x=180 y=2}

Now attach a dragdetect listener, in addition to the ones above and again click 
on the sash
You'll get the following events:
Selection: SelectionEvent{Sash {} time=604335578 data=null item=null detail=1 
x=0 y=144 width=563 height=3 stateMask=0 doit=true}
MouseDown: MouseEvent{Sash {} time=604335578 data=null button=1 stateMask=0 
x=251 y=2}
MouseUp: MouseEvent{Sash {} time=604335578 data=null button=1 stateMask=524288 
x=251 y=2}

Notice the second selection is missing. Gtk and motif record the same events as 
the first case whether dragdetect is attached or not.
A similar things happens for scale.
With mousedown, mouseup and selection attached, click on the thumb

You'll get the following events:
Selection: SelectionEvent{Scale {} time=608545937 data=null item=null detail=0 
x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0 stateMask=0 doit=true}
MouseDown: MouseEvent{Scale {} time=608545937 data=null button=1 stateMask=0 
x=72 y=18}
Selection: SelectionEvent{Scale {} time=608546046 data=null item=null detail=0 
x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0 stateMask=0 doit=true}
MouseUp: MouseEvent{Scale {} time=608546046 data=null button=1 stateMask=524288 
x=72 y=18}

If dragdetect is also attached, and the thumb clicked, you'll get the following 
events:
Selection: SelectionEvent{Scale {} time=608591921 data=null item=null detail=0 
x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0 stateMask=0 doit=true}
Selection: SelectionEvent{Scale {} time=608591921 data=null item=null detail=0 
x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0 stateMask=0 doit=true}
MouseDown: MouseEvent{Scale {} time=608591921 data=null button=1 stateMask=0 
x=72 y=17}
MouseUp: MouseEvent{Scale {} time=608591921 data=null button=1 stateMask=524288 
x=72 y=17}

Though an event isn't lost, the order of events is switched.

fake mouseup in Widget.wm_lbuttondown is now sent using OS.PostMessage
This caused bug 81759.
Grant to prioritize.
I've verified that this is working now, it should have been marked as FIXED 
just before Christmas.

I don't remember fixing this, especially for a sash ... and we put back the 
SendMessage() in WM_LBUTTONUP because this broke tool bars.  Billy?
I see the original problem again, and now cheese is left on the sash once the 
DragDetect has been hooked.
Possible fix: On most widgets, this can easily be fixed by NOT using OS.DragDetect, but rather emulating the drag-detection from WM_LBUTTONDOWN/UP, WM_MOUSEMOVE and WM_KEYDOWN. In fact, this is fairly simple to do, since all that has to be done is detect WM_MOUSEMOVE outside of a GetSystemMetrix(SM_CX/YDRAG) box between a WM_LBUTTONDOWN and WM_LBUTTONUP/WM_KEYDOWN(wParam=VK_ESC), then send the dragdetect to the position where the WM_LBUTTONDOWN occurred.

Two possible issues:
1. I don't have WinCE, so I can't be sure, is the behavior there the same?
2. Some widgets call DragDetect from the window proc, so some prevention may be in order there. Alternately, allow these to be handled as they are, since they use a completely overridden WM_LBUTTONDOWN anyway, and don't bare the same functionality as a Sash.</WithStack>

can find to modify the natures assigned to a project.

As a result, most plugins that use natures tack an action on to IProject's popup

It would be good in my opinion to have a page on the property page of a project
that allows the user to modify the natures assigned to a project.

    <WithStack>org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferencePage.setMessage() does not seem to wrap 
the message if the message is long. If you resize the preference window, you 
can see the whole message. But it would be nice to see the whole message 
without the need to resize it. 

From what I have seen, this happens when you call setMessage() to change the 
message from a short/blank one to a long one.
This is by design so as not to force a resize of the preference page due to an 
over long message.
We saw this problem during globalization. The message is very short in 
English, but after translated into different languages, the message became 
longer. We have seen this problem with 6 languages out of 9. Also, some Asian 
characters are much wider than Latin characters. Eclipse should make the 
effort to hold longer/wider messages in preference page. It is easy to 
maintain a short English message, but it is very hard to control the length 
after translated into other languages.
This is a general issue with anything translated. The only possible compromise 
is to shorten the message with an ellipsis if it is going to be truncated.

Message suppliers and translators should be aware of this issue and should 
endeavour to not create over long messages.

Be aware that the message is intended to indicate an error in a field in the 
dialog so it should be short and clear anyways.

- Used the template extension wizard from the manifest editor to generate a new
preference page.
- It generated not only an extension for the preference page, but also a
preference initializer extension (runtime).
- The referenced preference initializer class (PreferenceInitializer) was not
generated.

I would expect it to generate all classes referenced by the generated XML.
Konrad, tell me it isn't so ;-)
Generation of preference initializer extension is triggered by 
 IPluginBase.getSchemaVersion() != null
while generation of the class is triggered by
 PluginModelManager.isOSGiRuntime()

I would think they both need to be true to generate extsnsion and class.
I will attach a patch that does it.
Created attachment 16058
PreferencePageTemplate.patch
looks good.

- Used the PDE manfest editor's template extension support to generate a
preference page.
- It also generated a preference initializer.
- This is a 3.0 concept, but my plug-in does not have the 3.0 processing
instruction.  I'm trying to write a plug-in that is portable between 2.1 and 3.0.

Ideally, PDE would not generate 3.0 content for pre-3.0 plug-ins.
I realize that this is probably tricky to achieve though, requiring maintaining
multiple templates.
The preference template is the only tricky one.  For all other templates, we 
provide two versions.

Konrad, I'll leave it to you to decide whether we should invest in 2.1 stuff 
when we're in the 3.1 cycle.
Wassim,
I have no plan to invest in 2.1 templates, besides ensuring that correct 
template is used.

Other than this being caused by the same issue as bug 79222, I see it is 
sometimes possible for schema version being noticed incorrect from template 
generation code.
To reproduce: checkout org.eclipse.help.ui.  Open plugin.xml, delete 
processing instruction using source page, save, add extension - the preference 
page from the template.  The model.getPluginBase().getSchemaVersion() still 
returns 3.0, and generates wrong code.  Creating another preference extension, 
the schema version is reported correctly.

Nick,
Has the plug-in never had the 3.0 processing instruction, or have you deleted 
the line from the plug-in in the workspace?
sounds like we are forgetting to null the schema version field upon your first 
save.
It originally had the 3.0 tag, and I removed it.

Is it possible to update the state incrementally?  I wouldn't expect to have to
do a save between removing the 3.0 tag and adding a new extension?

Created attachment 16072
AbstractPluginDocumentHandler

It should fix determining the schema version after a change.
It will not be necessary to save.
Marking as fixed.  thanks Konrad.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In order to better interact with the community on technical issues or other
questions, it would be very useful to offer an infrastructure so teams can
easily poll the community.

In my opinion a multiple-choice question system is good enough. If people are
being asked to make comments, then the text should be stored in bugzilla because
it is the main place where we are used to retrieve info.
*** Bug 88804 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bug 68684 comment 30 explains why bugzilla voting is not sufficient.

Sorry, that should have been: Bug 68684 comment 40.

+1 here. This would allow us to make progress on contraversial bugs when the dev
teams cannot reach a consensus and bug ownership is unclear (or spans components).

Suggest raising severity to blocker. There are several highly visible PRs open
which are unlikely to be resolved without this.
Polling software is coming with Project Phoenix.
I have a working installation of PHPSurveyor. Would this fit your requirements?

http://phpsurveyor.sourceforge.net/index.php



Looks good to me.
PHPSurveyor is now an available tool to Eclipse committers. I will discuss it's
availablility shortly in a WebMaster update.  If you need it, please let me know.

- Generated a preference page using the PDE manifest editor's extension template.
- it generated an initializeDefaults() method like the following, called from
the constructor of the page:

	/**
	 * Sets the default values of the preferences.
	 */
	private void initializeDefaults() {
		IPreferenceStore store = getPreferenceStore();
		store.setDefault(P_BOOLEAN, true);
		store.setDefault(P_CHOICE, "choice2");
		store.setDefault(P_STRING, "Default value");
	}

This is setting the default values in the preference store.
This is not the responsibility of the preference page, but rather the plugin or
its preference initializer.  The page should never affect the default values
(although it should handle resetting the current values to the defaults).
I'm pretty certain the 3.0 template does not set defaults in the constructor 
of the page.  

Is this the 2.1 template, Nick?
Although it is certainly not the job of the preference page to set defaults, 
it's not that simple in 2.1 (ie. prior to the introduction of the preference 
initializer extension point).
The user can choose to create a plugin that has no top-level Java class, what 
do we do in this case?
Also, templates are decoupled and separate entities, having the initializer 
code in the plugin Java class requires some internal knowledge, etc.

All those problems no longer exist with the new 3.0 preference initializer 
extension point.
I'm pretty sure I tried this from 3.1, since it also tried to generate the
preference initializer.

Yes, in 3.1, I still get the initializeDefaults(), and no PreferenceInitializer.

It is caused by same issue as bug 79222 - wrong template used.

My guess here is that the motif behaviour is "correct" since it most closely

On some platforms and in certain widgets, space doesn't select an item.  Need 
to check the various controls.

    <WithStack>Hello,

I have a real problem. I started developing the new Version of an
Seatingmap-editor based on GEF 3.1 and the project is nearly complete. 
But today I realized that neither SWT nor Draw2D supports Rotation of Figures,
but this is an essential Feature, as I have to be backwards-compatible to the
old File-Format. I thought that this could be done, with the help of the Class
org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Transform, but I as I saw today this is not the case.
Because I think that Rotation is an essential feature in an Graphical Framework,
it would be really nice, if this feature could be somehow integrated into the
final release of the GEF 3.1. 

Thank you very much in advance
Daniel
Rotation doesn't exist in SWT. You'll have to fake it in your layout manager 
and figure hierarchy.  If you are just drawing primitive shapes, you could 
write utilities for transforming the different calls.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>We need to be able to determine if the user set thier locale using the -nl 
command line parameter or if it was determined by querying the default Locale.

I am happy with a system property (e.g. "osgi.nl.user") if you want to do it 
that way so as not to change any current behaviour.
Given the nature of the initial problem that we are trying to fix, a very low 
disturbance fix has been implemented.

The osgi.nl.user is set to the osgi.nl value if one of -nl or osgi.nl.user has 
been specified. The fix is made in EnvironmentInfo.java.
How does this handle the case where the user does -Dosgi.nl or puts it in their 
config.ini file (where I would expect an installer to write it)

Every case is handled in the EnvironmentInfo#setupSystemContext().

This API is not public.
The code for the fix is in #setupSystemContext, but the fix itself consists in
setting the  osgi.nl.user property. See comment #1.

So what public API can I use to get this value?
java.lang.System.getProperty("osgi.nl.user")</WithStack>

Similar to bug 79229, not firing Selection on Space may be a valid platform 
difference.

Same behaviour in cocoa.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>- run the ControlExample, go to the Tree tab
- listen for KeyUp, KeyDown, Selection and Default Selection
- give focus to an item in the example Tree on the page
- press Space
  -&gt; on mac you'll get KeyDown - KeyUp
  -&gt; on win32 and motif you'll get KeyDown, Selection, KeyUp
I believe this is platform behavior.  Need to check this.
-&gt; on win32 and motif you'll get KeyDown, Selection, KeyUp
on XP (with and without manifest) I observe:
selection, key down, key up

1. on the Mac, pressing space bar on a currently selected item does not seem to trigger a notification.

3. The Selection event upon keyboard 'selection' is sent from the stack trace below. However, the OS 
only fires it the first time it enters an item. As a result, we don't send the event for every space key even 
though we send selection for every mouse down.

Currently, breakpoint icons in the vertical ruler look the same when they are
a) not installed yet
b) skipped since the 'Skip all breakpoints' toggle is engaged

The icons should be different for these two cases. About every other week, I am
puzzled why my breakpoints are not hit, until I realize that I have 'Skip all
breakpoints' active and don't remember it.

Breakpoints could be rendered gray when 'Skip all breakpoints' is active. Gray
could be generated out of the blue icon with SWT.IMAGE_GRAY.


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 71149 ***
We should also probably put up a warning whenever the user creates a new launch in debug mode 
with the breakpoint manager disabled.
Re comment 2: If you do this, then the user should be able to disable the
warning. My most common use case for 'Skip All Breakpoints' is to start up
without breakpoints and enable them when everything's up &amp; running.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The Create project wizard will create the project folder and .project file 
after hitting next on the first page of the project creation wizard. If you 
then hit back the project folder and .project file are deleted. This will 
cause problems with SCM providers since once the files are created, users are 
prompted to add them to source control. If the user has added files to source 
control we don’t want to then remove them.
Could the Create Project wizard run in a workspace operation so resource 
creation events are delivered after the user has completed all of the steps?
The issue here is that it is likely other wizards are relying on that 
behaviour to determine other things (I can't say for sure as we only supply 
the base wizard) so changing that behaviour will likely be a breaking change.

The problem with doing a workbench operation is that you will lock the 
workbench for the duration of the wizard invocation - if someone then does 
something in a different Thread using the same wizard it could dealock itself.

What is SCM? There might be a solution we can find that is non breaking.
SCM stands for "Software Configuration Management".  Thus, we could substitute 
the term "Team providers" in place of "SCM providers" in the original bug 
description.

I checked this on 3.3.0 and the problem is not with the base wizard or the plug-in project wizard. It is with the java project wizard. Anders, can you confirm this? Were you talking about the java project wizard in comment #0?
After testing it does seem that the Java Project is the one with the problem. General/base Projects and feature/plugin projects don't seem to have a problem. I don't honestly remember if in 2004 other projects had a similar problem but since they don't anymore, if we can fix the Java Project creation wizard that would be great. 
The real problem is in any wizzard that adds files and then removes them.

&gt; since they don't anymore, if we can fix the Java Project creation wizard that
&gt; would be great.

We should probably move this to JDT/UI then. Though, as comment 2 noted, some adopters of JDT may be relying on that behaviour.

&gt; The real problem is in any wizzard that adds files and then removes them.

Well, the Platform team really has no control over this bit, as you can imagine.
(In reply to comment #5)
&gt; After testing it does seem that the Java Project is the one with the problem.

Is this still an issue? Existing team providers don't seem to have problems with this.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>The Create project wizard will create the project folder and .project file 
after hitting next on the first page of the project creation wizard. If you 
then hit back the project folder and .project file are deleted. This will 
cause problems with SCM providers since once the files are created, users are 
prompted to add them to source control. If the user has added files to source 
control we don’t want to then remove them.
Could the Create Project wizard run in a workspace operation so resource 
creation events are delivered after the user has completed all of the steps?
The issue here is that it is likely other wizards are relying on that 
behaviour to determine other things (I can't say for sure as we only supply 
the base wizard) so changing that behaviour will likely be a breaking change.

The problem with doing a workbench operation is that you will lock the 
workbench for the duration of the wizard invocation - if someone then does 
something in a different Thread using the same wizard it could dealock itself.

What is SCM? There might be a solution we can find that is non breaking.
SCM stands for "Software Configuration Management".  Thus, we could substitute 
the term "Team providers" in place of "SCM providers" in the original bug 
description.

I checked this on 3.3.0 and the problem is not with the base wizard or the plug-in project wizard. It is with the java project wizard. Anders, can you confirm this? Were you talking about the java project wizard in comment #0?

    <WithStack>I am having quite a bit of trouble trying to use either the ant task or the
WSDLValidate command line tool along with the WS-I Basic Profile validation.  I
am using version 1.2.0 of WSVT. 
  
First, I had to grunge through the code to discover that the proper command line
to validate for WS-I was this: 
  
-wsiv org.eclipse.wsdl.validate.wsi.bp10.WSIValidator
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/ validatewsi 
-schemaDir plugins/org.eclipse.wsdl.validate/xsd 
 &lt;path to wsdl&gt; 
  
The syntax of the -wsiv switch was not documented.  Actually the whole existence
of the command line tool isn't documented.  In fact in the CVS code, the syntax
has changed for generic external validators.  Once I figured that out, I am
currently stuck because there does not seem to be any way to define the location
of the WS-I test assertion document.  There are several APIs to do this,
although only one, WSITestToolsProperties.setTADFile(), is used and the only
thing that actually calls the setTADFile() API is the eclipse plugin.  Looks
like there is a missing call in WSDLValidate.java: 
            else if(param.equalsIgnoreCase(WSDLValidate.PARAM_WSIVAL)) 
            { 
              WSDLConfigurator.registerWSIValidator(namespace, validatorClass,
propertiesFile, null); 
NEW è 
WSITestToolsProperties.setTADFile(WSIConstants.DEFAULT_TEST_ASSERTIONS_DOCUMENT_URI);

            } 
  
  
As for the ant task (which is what I actually want to use), I can see no way to
configure the WS-I validator class event though WSI validation defaults to
WSI_REQUIRE.  The registration is missing, so the validation prints the message: 
   [WSDLValidate] WARNING 1:1:There is no WS-I Compliance validator registered
for namespace http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/. 
  
Looks like a register and setTADFile() call should be added in ant.WSDLValidate
on line 278: 
    // Register WS-I validator 
    WSDLConfigurator.registerWSIValidator("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/",
"org.eclipse.wsdl.validate.wsi.bp10.WSIValidator", "validatewsi", null); 
  
  
I haven't managed to rebuild with these changes to verify them, which is my next
step.  I have to download eclipse first... 
  
I checked the CVS source, but I didn't see any indication that the ant task
would actually do the WS-I validation there either, although it looks like
things have changed a great deal since the last (1.2) release.
Changing component to Web Tools -&gt; WSDL
The Ant task part of this defect is a duplicate of 66004. I will leave this
defect open to deal with the command line UI.
Tom, I've cc'ed you on 66004.
I'm downgrading the severity of this defect as it is not a mainstream WTP scenario.
The WS-I WSDL validator extension has been updated and can now run as part of the command line WSDL validation task. (See bug 66004 for more information about the task.)

To specify the compliance level the WSDLValidate task has been updated to accept properties in the form of -Dname=value. To specify the compliance level one of the following should be set

WS-I validation with the attachments profile
http://ws-i.org/profiles/BasicWithAttachments/ComplianceLevel
WS-I validation with the simple soap basic profile (SSBP_
http://ws-i.org/profiles/Basic/ComplianceLevel

The following values are defined for each: REQUIRE, SUGGEST, IGNORE.

For example, to specify that WS-I SSBP compliance is required specify
-Dhttp://ws-i.org/profiles/Basic/ComplianceLevel=REQUIRE

note: The WS-I WSDL validator currently has dependencies on ICU4J, the WTP WST URI resolution framework and UDDI4J. All of these libraries plus WSDL4J and Xerces (required by the WSDL validator) must be located on the classpath. More work needs to be done to reduce the number of requirements.
Released to WTP 1.5RC2.
I will mark this as verified just to avoid the Email spam, but I will not that I have not had a chance to test this in any way.
OK Tom. I did test this on WTP 1.5. Feel free to reopen if you have a chance/need to use this functionality in the future and find that it is not working as you'd expect.

Closing bug.</WithStack>

To reproduce:
Open ErrorLog view, ensure it is closed in other perspectives.
Change some of the view settings, like log filters or column width.
Close the view, and reopen.  Settings are lost.

The view uses IMemento provided by the workbench to save/restore setting.  The 
settings should rather be kept in the plugin workspace preferences.
This can be a small break in Cherie's activities to keep in touch.
Don't worry -- I've been putting code in here and there because I miss you all 
so much ;-)

I'll fix up this one too :)
Filter dialog state now saved to plug-in's dialog settings.
Other view states (i.e. column widths, sorting order of columns,
activate-on-new-events flag) are saved to plug-in preferences.

Fixed and released to head :)

Also of note is that the sort-by-date functionality was not working due to an
incompatible date pattern.  This has also been fixed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I have modified the code formatting defaults slightly, mostly just to columnar
tabulation of arguments. In certain cases, I am getting truly bizarre
formatting, for example, the code:

public class TestFormatting {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            while (true) {
                if (true) {
                    if (true) {
                        TestFormatting.longNamedMethod(true, true, 
                                                       "Some very long " + 
                                                       true + 
                                                       " String to break");
                    }
                }
            }
        } finally {
        }
    }

    public static void longNamedMethod(boolean aBoolean,
                                       boolean anotherBoolean, String aString) {
    }
}

reformats to this:

public class TestFormatting {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            while (true) {
                if (true) {
                    if (true) {
                        TestFormatting
                                .longNamedMethod(
                                                 true,
                                                 true,
                                                 "Some very long "
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                    + true
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                    + " String to break");
                    }
                }
            }
        } finally {
        }
    }

    public static void longNamedMethod(boolean aBoolean,
                                       boolean anotherBoolean, String aString) {

Ownership has changed for the formatter, but I surely will not have enough time to fix your bug during the 3.5 development process, hence set its priority to P5.
Please provide a patch if you definitely need the bug to be fixed in this version and I'll have a look at it...
TIA

This works fine for me using N20130110-2000.
Verified for  4.3 M6 with build I20130310-2000

Note: The current output with the given formatter looks like the following and does not contain the additional blank lines as reported originally,(I believe this is the expected output):


                        TestFormatting
                                .longNamedMethod(true, true,
                                                 "Some very long " + true
                                                         + " String to break");</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I have modified the code formatting defaults slightly, mostly just to columnar
tabulation of arguments. In certain cases, I am getting truly bizarre
formatting, for example, the code:

public class TestFormatting {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            while (true) {
                if (true) {
                    if (true) {
                        TestFormatting.longNamedMethod(true, true, 
                                                       "Some very long " + 
                                                       true + 
                                                       " String to break");
                    }
                }
            }
        } finally {
        }
    }

    public static void longNamedMethod(boolean aBoolean,
                                       boolean anotherBoolean, String aString) {
    }
}

reformats to this:

public class TestFormatting {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            while (true) {
                if (true) {
                    if (true) {
                        TestFormatting
                                .longNamedMethod(
                                                 true,
                                                 true,
                                                 "Some very long "
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                    + true
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                    + " String to break");
                    }
                }
            }
        } finally {
        }
    }

    public static void longNamedMethod(boolean aBoolean,
                                       boolean anotherBoolean, String aString) {

Ownership has changed for the formatter, but I surely will not have enough time to fix your bug during the 3.5 development process, hence set its priority to P5.
Please provide a patch if you definitely need the bug to be fixed in this version and I'll have a look at it...
TIA

This works fine for me using N20130110-2000.
Verified for  4.3 M6 with build I20130310-2000

Note: The current output with the given formatter looks like the following and does not contain the additional blank lines as reported originally,(I believe this is the expected output):


                        TestFormatting

    <WithStack>I would like to toggle 'Show only proposals visible in the invocation context'
on and off upon subsequent pushes of ctrl+space.

Sometimes I have methods that take string for example, but the first invocation
is going to be a URL, the second would be a String.  Example

class X{
void giveInfo(String value);
}

X x;
URL url;

Step 1
x.giveInfo(url. 

At this point only methods of URL which return String are visible, but I need to
change to file first.

x.giveInfo(url.getFile()

But I can not see URL.getFile without turning off this feature.  but i like to
keep it on most of the time.  So it would be nice if I could toggle it on and
off with each push.  Hope I explained it correctly.
Move to JDT/UI. This might required a diffent keybinding. I don't know if this
is doable.
I can't reproduce this and I don't think that's how 'Show only proposals visible
in the invocation context' works:
It's only about filtering non-visible elements (e.g. package protected,
protected or private method or fields). With you example I see 'getFile()' but
also getClass(). (You could continue getClass().getName())

Can you clarify?
I was under the impression that it was filtering based on the reference type in
which the returned object would be put.  When I went searching for why I was
seeing this, I saw that option in the preferences and assumed that was it.  If
this is not how that behaves, then perhaps what I saw was a bug, and I'll have
to pay close attention next time this happens.
I set it to 'WORKSFORME', please reopen it or file a new one if you see the
problem again</WithStack>

I have Runtime jar'd in my target.  I then tried to import it as binary into my 
workspace.  It seemed to work ok except for two things
- the resultant project was not marked as binary (the binary filter in the 
package explorer did not filter it but did filter all the other (non jar'd) 
plugins that I imported)

- The classes did not seem to show up for consumers.  Various plugins that 
prereq runtime were unable to resolve runtime classes

I deleted the newly imported runtime project and reimported using a non-JAR'd 
version of the plugin and everything worked as expected

There were no relevant messages in the log.
Jeff, can you please attach the JAR in question...
Created attachment 16066
JAR'd Runtime plugin

As requested, here is the runtime plugin as a jar.  It otherwise seems to
function correctly.  I can run with it, compile against it, ...
Fixed up the problem with the filter.

The problem with the compilation is a JDT/Core problem.  Dup of bug 64340.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The following enhancements are to be made to the Memory View:

* Memory View consists of multiple panes. (MemoryViewPane and 
RenderingViewPane).  These view panes are statically managed the Memory View.   
As a result, new view panes cannot be added to the view easily.  

Planned Changes:  Make Memory View more dynamic.  It should be able to handle 
new view panes on the fly.

* Memory View cannot host more than one rendering view pane. If there are 
multiple rendering view panes in the memory view, the behaviour of 
adding/removing rendering becomes confusing for user.  All view panes listen to 
events from memory rendering manager.  When a memory rendering is added, all 
view panes get the same event and will add the same rendering.  As a result, 
the renderings are duplicated in the view panes.

Planned Changes:  Remove IMemroyRenderingListener and the add/remove rendering 
event mechanism from the memory rendering manager.  The rendering manager is 
responsible for parsing memoryRenderingTypes extension only.  A rendering view 
pane is responsible for managing the life cycle of its memory renderings.

* Enhance IMultipaneMemoryView and IMemoryViewPane API.  

Planned Changes:  These definitions of these two interfaces need to be 
refined.  

* Need IRenderingViewPane interface to allow actions to add renderings to a 
rendering view pane.

Patch to org.eclipse.debug.ui

Included in this patch:
* Implemented IMemoryBlockModelPresentation in DelegatingModelPresentation and
LazyModelPresentation.
* Removed the hack in MemoryViewTab for getting to a
IMemoryBlockModelPresentation
* Remove IMemoryRenderingListener and the notifier in MemoryRenderingManager.
* Refined IMultipaneMemoryView interface
* Added IMemoryViewPane and IRenderingViewPane
* Added ViewPaneRenderingMgr for managing renderings in a view pane.
* Made memory view more extensible.
Applied patch.
Marking verified. Will open new bugs as required for API review.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Hi all,

CVS server 1.12.9 on AIX 5.
WSAD
Version: 5.1.1
Build id: 20031120_1915

When one of our developers tag/branch a version, the same/other developers
click on the tag/branch, the [no such tag] appears.
However, when we user other cvs client, WinCVS, the tag and branch can be seen

As we cannot check out from tag/branch, it causing quite a problem to us.

Eclipse 2.1.2 does not support the developer release of CVS (1.12.*). Please 
use the production release (1.11.*). Having said that, the checkout should 
work. The only reason it would fail is if you were checking out a branch that 
did not contain any files. Are you sure that the folder you have selected 
contains files in the branch?

Alse, a workaround would be to check the project out of HEAD and perform a 
Replace with&gt;Branch and Version.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I've got an executable w/debug info where the entry point does not have any
source associated with it.

When I start debugging on this file, I get an error message. Log
attached.
Created attachment 16060
Nothing particularly helpful in the log since the exception was scensored
Created attachment 16061
I set a breakpoint on NullPointerException and got this. Smells related...
Is this related? I get it with the same executable...

This is bug 68413. Fixed by the platform.

    <WithOutStack>I've got an executable w/debug info where the entry point does not have any
source associated with it.

When I start debugging on this file, I get an error message. Log
attached.
Created attachment 16060
Nothing particularly helpful in the log since the exception was scensored
Created attachment 16061
I set a breakpoint on NullPointerException and got this. Smells related...
Is this related? I get it with the same executable...




Created attachment 16062
Shows a bit more information about the null pointer exception
(In reply to comment #2)
&gt; Created an attachment (id=16061) [edit]
&gt; I set a breakpoint on NullPointerException and got this. Smells related...

This is bug 68413. Fixed by the platform.

Good point Leif. I've made the corresponding change to the WTP main page.
This change is a bulk update of all _un_targeted, fixed, resolved bugs upon release of M5. This particular bug _might_ have been fixed earlier than M5. (Feel free to correct).

An Error Dialog with "Problems encountered during search" shows up.

We need to handle this situation more gracefully:
* provide the user with information for how to avoid the problem 
* offer to refresh the out of sync files (in 3.1 you can contribute a button to
the Problems dialog)
Quickly looked at old search:
- also shows error dialog
- other files are searched i.e. the errors are collected
- no refresh option

other files are now searched and the error dialog in the end lists the files
with problems (in 20050405)</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I tested the lomboz plugin and wasn't satisfied with the JSP editor so i 
deinstalled it again (deleted all files/directories in the plugins directory). 
However, no matter what editor i use (e.g. the simple text editor), earlier 
compiler errors are displayed in the editor and the package explorer (and the 
problems view). No matter if the errors still exist or not. I haven't found a 
way to "clean up" these faulty error marks...?
Can you try if 'Project-&gt;Clean' does the job?
If not, platform should automatically delete markers of not present plugins or
at least allow to remove them (e.g in the problems view)
Of course, that was part of my attempts to make them go away (close/open 
project, clean project, restart Eclipse, restart Computer, ...). The error 
messages are simply false, e.g.

"PayScaleBean.PROP_CODE cannot be resolved"

but I already changed the code so there is no constant PayScaleBean.PROP_CODE 
anymore anywhere in my class and in my JSP page.
BTW: I also hoped to remove them in the problems view, but the "Delete" Popup 
menu item is ghosted (i.e. not selectable).
Moving to platform. There must be a way to remove markers generated by either
buggy or uninstalled plugins
We do not provide a way to clear incorrectly created markers currently.

There are currently no plans to work on this feature
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

I will investigate.
I could not reproduce.
I fixed the possible class cast exception. Code is released.
Reopen if you see it again.
Bug was to cast an AbstractMethodDeclaration into an AnnotationMethodDeclaration
if it was not an instanceof MethodDeclaration (when computing the return type).
This would always cause a ClassCastException for Clinit and ConstructorDeclaration.

Verified (in I20041214-2000) that the fix consists in returning null for the
return type of Clinit and ConstructorDeclaration.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Starting with 3.1M3 I noticed, that plain java comments are now formatted. This
breaks Clover directives inserted in the code:

 ///CLOVER:OFF
 System.exit(-1);
 ///CLOVER:ON

is suddenly now formatted as:

 // /CLOVER:OFF
 System.exit(-1);
 // /CLOVER:ON

While I want my javadoc comments to be formatted, I don't want this for other
Java comments, but I cannot select this in the formatting options.

New form-based compiler prefs: can't scroll with mouse wheel.
Moving to SWT for advice:
Open Preferences - Java - Compiler - Error and Warnings in I20041123

I'm using a ScrolledComposite (in fact a SharedScrolledComposite from ui.forms)
in the preference settings area. Normally the tree on the left has the focus so
the scrollwheel scrolls the tree.

To get the wheel working on the right side you have to give a focus to one of
the widgets inside the scrolled composite. This is not so easy as it either
involves using the TAB keys, or by carful clicking without changing setting at
the same time.
But e.g. clicking on the scollbar doesn't, same for just clicking somewhere at
an empty space in the composite: Focus stays on the tree on the left.

I guess what the user expects is that clicking on the scollbar or somwhere else
in the composite would allow hime to scroll. But the dialog is clearly something
different than views that have clear focus.
I found adding the following snipped gave me a expected behaviour.
  addListener(SWT.Activate, new Listener() {
    public void handleEvent(Event event) {
      if (event.type == SWT.Activate) {
	forceFocus();
      }
    }
  });
Is that a good idea? Should all scrolled composited in dialog implement
something like that? 


(listener was added to my extension of ScrolledComposite)
FH, it seems that no composite has focus inside the hiearchy.  Is this true?  
What does the operating system do in this case?
Steve says:

1) In general, scroll bars can't take focus when they are clicked on because 
this would take focus away from the client area.  Imagine a text editor that 
did this.  SWT can't do this for free.

2) Clicking in a composite that has children can't assign focus to a child.  
Imagine a dialog with OK and CANCEL buttons and the user accidently clicks on 
the background composite.  Focus should not change in this case.  So SWT 
shouldn't do anything here either.

I can't imagine a case where the application should resassign focus when a 
scroll bar is clicked.

Are you asking for the mouse wheel to scroll that widget that is under the 
cursor?
I checked some window dialogs and see that they all behave as you specified. 
Clicking on scrollbars does not change any focus.
Ok to close

I played with the new form-based compiler prefs and found it harder to use
because not all settings are visible: I have to scroll down to see them. More
user interaction is involved.
Agree. And with tabs, you know at a glance what other categories are available.
Maybe links on the top to focus faster on the setting? Or have all nodes
collapsed (I think that give much more clicking work)

Tabs have advantages, I agree, but they don't scale. 4 tabs is the maximum and
Philippe is adding more and more options.
&gt; Tabs have advantages, I agree, but they don't scale. 4 tabs is the maximum [..]

Yeah, but a scrolling list also doesn't scale. Having 7 tabs is still way more
convenient than a huge scrolling list.

Initially collapsing categories sounds like a bad idea. This would in essence
start a new tree inside the preference page. If that's the intention, then the
additional tree level should rather be added to the main preference pages tree.
On level more io the right is not a good idea, 7 tabs neither
I almost fell out of my chair when I saw the new compilers preference page.  

Now that I regained consciousness and gave the new page a fair chance, here is 
my take on it:

Too many tabs is a real issue, but so is scrolling. Too much scrolling is much 
worse than too many tabs though.

If I may be the voice of reason :-), I suggest a compromise:
1. Keep the collapsable sections, since the reason why they are there is 
pretty valid.  
2. Allow a maximum of one section to be expanded at one time.  This will 
reduce and even eliminate the scrolling in most cases.
3. When grouping, try not to have groups that only have one item (e.g. String 
externalization)

certainly better, but too jumpy (when used the way I use it - i.e. when I 
don't collapse expanded sections manually).

For example, with the first section expanded, go to the last section and 
expand it.  The first one will now collapse and everything will jump quite a

Not sure what triggers it, neither who is doing it. I get the following stderr
output once in a while:

(&lt;unknown&gt;:27693): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Deprecated function.  User
modifications to the MIME database are no longer supported.

In my development workbench, the output reads:

(Gecko:11501): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Deprecated function.  User modifications
to the MIME database are no longer supported.

So I suspect the mozilla/gecko library is doing this, hence I punted it to SWT.
Probably nothing we can do much about, but here's the bug anyway.
Tom: which Linux distribution are you using?
fedora core 3 - and now you mention it: the warnings have just started to show
up after upgrading from core 2.

$ rpm -q libgnome gnome-vfs gnome-vfs2
libgnome-2.8.0-2
gnome-vfs-1.0.5-21
gnome-vfs2-2.8.2-8

GNOME has recently been revamping their MIME system.  There is likely some
change which is affecting how we use it.
This results in not finding any platform mime handlers, including the system
browser, any more.

Program.findProgram(..., "html") won't find anything due to seeing an empty mime
database.
*** Bug 72110 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 83585 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I recently discussed the state of the Program API implementation on GNOME with
Marco Pesenti Gritti, one of the libgnomevfs maintainers.  Here are some of my
thoughts:

 1. The warnings are not accurate.  We are not trying to modify the database.
    This seems to be a bug in libgnomevfs.
 2. The major change in gnomevfs is that they now use the xdgmime system as
    a back-end.
 3. This system makes it difficult to support the old libgnomevfs
    API which we use.  Therefore, most, if not all, of the GNOME code in
    Program.java will need to be rewritten.
 4. Much of the API we will need to use has only been around since GNOME 2.4.
 5. Some of the Program API may be unimplementable with the new API without
    changes upstream, specifically listing all known programs and listing all
    known file extensions.
Billy, I guess I am just re-stating the obvious, but... while our supported
systems do not include FC3 or (AFAIK) any other system using 2.8, it is a
"major" issue that eclipse does not support launching external apps on any of these.

Do you think that this will make it on the 3.1 plan, given the facts you
outlined in comment 7?

Patch

On platform-swt-dev, Ty C was interested in helping with this bug.  Here are my
current hacks that I hope to get in soon:

- I use gnome_url_open() to implement Program.launch().  This API has existed
since GNOME 2.2, and it's much simpler than the original code.	This makes
"Open With &gt; System Editor" work properly in Eclipse.
- I use gnome_vfs_mime_type_from_name() to implement findProgram(), which
avoids actually querying the MIME database.  This API has existed since at
least GNOME 1.4, and so it is also safe.  This allows for getting icons and
program names.

Program.execute() can be implemented on newer GNOME versions using
gnome_vfs_mime_application_launch(), but this API is new in GNOME 2.4, and
currently gnome-vfs provides no clean way to do runtime version checks like
GTK+ does.  This makes it a little more complicated, so I haven't done that
yet.  Once Program.execute() works, only getPrograms() and getExtensions() will
be left unfinished, and I believe they may not be possible to implement with
the new gnome-vfs API.
I did not have much success with gnome_url_open() on RHEL3 or RH9, so I guess
this code will need version checks as well.

Adds static icon retrieval methods to Mac OS X Carbon variant

The patch primarily enhances Program.java. A caller may use the 2 new static

Adds static icon retrieval methods to Linux GTK variant

The patch primarily enhances Program.java. A caller may use the 2 new static
methods to retrieve an icon either by file name extension or by requesting the
system folder icon.

The patch uses the same method to get the MIME type as the first patch attached
to this bug, but uses GTK functions instead of GNOME ones which are deprecated.
Ty, can you open a new bug with your patch?  I'd rather keep this one just about
the GTK+ implementation.  Thanks.
First about the GTK+ patch, thanks a lot for posting your code!  There are
really two parts to it: one is the update to use the new GNOME 2.8 API, and the
other part is the addition of the new API.  Please file a new bug about the API
additions.  In this bug I'm addressing the deprecated API use and what to do
about it.

The real difference between your solution from my patches is the use of
GtkIconTheme versus GnomeIconTheme.  I think I'm going to stick with using the
GnomeIconTheme code because it still works on newer systems, and is backwards
compatible to GNOME 2.2.  One change I did make (see bug 92505) was to only
create a GNOME icon theme once, rather than each time we do a lookup.  This is
much more efficient, especially on newer GNOME systems.  Having a separate
helper to lookup the MIME type per extension is a good idea as well.

The only parts of the Program API which are not implemented on GNOME 2.4 and
higher are getPrograms() and getExtensions(), both of which cannot be
implemented with the new libgnome-vfs API.  There will be no more warnings
printed to the console while running Eclipse.

Not sure what triggers it, neither who is doing it. I get the following stderr
output once in a while:

(&lt;unknown&gt;:27693): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Deprecated function.  User
modifications to the MIME database are no longer supported.

In my development workbench, the output reads:

(Gecko:11501): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Deprecated function.  User modifications
to the MIME database are no longer supported.

So I suspect the mozilla/gecko library is doing this, hence I punted it to SWT.
Probably nothing we can do much about, but here's the bug anyway.
Tom: which Linux distribution are you using?
fedora core 3 - and now you mention it: the warnings have just started to show
up after upgrading from core 2.

$ rpm -q libgnome gnome-vfs gnome-vfs2
libgnome-2.8.0-2
gnome-vfs-1.0.5-21
gnome-vfs2-2.8.2-8

GNOME has recently been revamping their MIME system.  There is likely some
change which is affecting how we use it.
This results in not finding any platform mime handlers, including the system
browser, any more.

Program.findProgram(..., "html") won't find anything due to seeing an empty mime
database.

I recently discussed the state of the Program API implementation on GNOME with
Marco Pesenti Gritti, one of the libgnomevfs maintainers.  Here are some of my
thoughts:

 1. The warnings are not accurate.  We are not trying to modify the database.
    This seems to be a bug in libgnomevfs.
 2. The major change in gnomevfs is that they now use the xdgmime system as
    a back-end.
 3. This system makes it difficult to support the old libgnomevfs
    API which we use.  Therefore, most, if not all, of the GNOME code in
    Program.java will need to be rewritten.
 4. Much of the API we will need to use has only been around since GNOME 2.4.
 5. Some of the Program API may be unimplementable with the new API without
    changes upstream, specifically listing all known programs and listing all
    known file extensions.
Billy, I guess I am just re-stating the obvious, but... while our supported
systems do not include FC3 or (AFAIK) any other system using 2.8, it is a
"major" issue that eclipse does not support launching external apps on any of these.

Do you think that this will make it on the 3.1 plan, given the facts you
outlined in comment 7?

For what it's worth, I get this too using a Debian variant (SimplyMEPIS).

Patch

On platform-swt-dev, Ty C was interested in helping with this bug.  Here are my
current hacks that I hope to get in soon:

- I use gnome_url_open() to implement Program.launch().  This API has existed
since GNOME 2.2, and it's much simpler than the original code.	This makes
"Open With &gt; System Editor" work properly in Eclipse.
- I use gnome_vfs_mime_type_from_name() to implement findProgram(), which
avoids actually querying the MIME database.  This API has existed since at
least GNOME 1.4, and so it is also safe.  This allows for getting icons and
program names.

Program.execute() can be implemented on newer GNOME versions using
gnome_vfs_mime_application_launch(), but this API is new in GNOME 2.4, and
currently gnome-vfs provides no clean way to do runtime version checks like
GTK+ does.  This makes it a little more complicated, so I haven't done that
yet.  Once Program.execute() works, only getPrograms() and getExtensions() will
be left unfinished, and I believe they may not be possible to implement with
the new gnome-vfs API.
I did not have much success with gnome_url_open() on RHEL3 or RH9, so I guess
this code will need version checks as well.

    <WithStack>We have the following problem:

  We have the following class hierarchy:
    public class ToDoImpl {
       public void doToDo() {
          System.out.println("Doing something");
       }
    }

    public class ToDoDebug1 extends ToDoImpl {
       public void doToDo() {
          super.doToDo();

          System.err.println("Debug info here");
       }
    }

    public class ToDoFacade extends ToDoDebug1 {
       // other methods, doToDo() is inherited from base classes
    }

These classes are part of a library, which is build independently from the
projects using it. 
A dependent program is required to use only the ToDoFacade class. The ToDoDebug1
class is for internal
debugging purpuses and never used externally (it is public, because we have to
used the ToDoImpl class which is delivered with a public API by another Library).

When I implement the following class:

    public class ReallyDo {
       public void callingDoToDo() {
          ToDoFacade myToDo = new ToDoFacade();
          myToDo.doToDo();
       }
    }

The Sun javac Compiler will generate the following virtual call inside the
callingDoToDo method:
  invokevirtual ToDoFacade.doToDo()

The Eclipse compiler will optimize that call and generate:
  invokevirtual ToDoDebug1.doToDo() [because it is inherited and not overwritten ?]

Both work normally.But when we remove the ToDoDebug1 class in the hierarchy
(which does not remove any method or interface)
or exchange it witch a new ToDoDebug2 class (which also does not change the
Method API), the eclipse
compiled class ReallyToDo is not any longer binary compatible with the changed
library and has to be
re-compiled with the new library to work, whereas the Sun-javac compiled code is
compatible and works
flawlessly (the ToDoDebug1 class is _not_ imported or mentioned in the ReallyDo
source. The reference
is compiled into the class file by the eclipse compiler).

So if one build a Library for customers who only use the ToDoFacade API it is
not possible to
use different Debug-Between classes or to remove them after a while (the API
itself is not changed !).
I don't know if this special case is really defined in java's guidelines for
binary compatibility,
(one can interpret it so or so), but I found a place where it says that the
compiler has to invoke
the virtual Method of the declared class, and not the super classes method,
unless super is explicitly
given in the source code.

First question: is there a compiler flag to prevent this behaviour and make it
compatible to javac ?

Next  question: is this a bug or a feature ? It reduces felxibility somewhat,
because sometimes it
is necessary (here for debugging purpuses) to insert a public class (because the
base class is already
public) into a hierarchy without changing the Method/Interface/Field API. Javac
is flexible enough, and
nothing is broken. Under Eclipse all depending projects have to be rebuild ...
(and they do not mention
the ToDoDebug1 class in their source, this information is only in the compiled
class file).
Could you please provide the version of javac used in your example and the
compiler options used in Eclipse?
Thanks.
You got me .. my eclipse settings were 1.3 compliance and i comared that to
class files generated with a 1.4.2 javac ... when I set eclipse to 1.4
compliance it did it like 1.4 javac (and the other direction: the 1.3 javac
generated the same code as eclipse did when in 1.3 compliance) ... so this was
my fault, i close the (not existing) bug
Hmmm .. just to mention it: when I use the JDK 1.4.2 javac with -target 1.3 it
generates the same virtual call as when using it without -target (which is not
calling the base class but the right class), so this seems to be a javac issue
and not a JDK compliance issue ... the question is then, whether eclipse should
generate class files like javac 1.3 did, or generate class files as javac 1.4
does when it is used with -target 1.3 ... uhoh ...
It seems, that this has been discussed in Bug 34000 ... so this is a duplicate</WithStack>

    <WithStack>eclipse hangs for a long time when cvs server can be contacted, but doesn't
exchange any tcp/ip data on open socket.

btw, this often happens when i tunnel cvs through ssh to a remote server, and
use pserver:mandrews@localhost as cvs account in eclipse, but thereafter tunnel
goes down due to network conditions or other independent reasons. in this case,
local ssh process accepts connection to port 2401, but can not relay it to
remote server.... thus, eclipse hangs for several minutes with no GUI interactivity.
I have tried to reproduce this by placing a breakpoint at the spot where we 
make the connection and trying several commands. I have not been able to get 
into a situation where the UI is unresponsive. What operation did you perform 
to make the UI unresponsive?

    <WithStack>When reviewing binary files in the SVN or CVS revision history view, it does not
open the associated editor.  Instead it dumps the binary contents of the
revision to a text view.

Steps:

1. Create a MS Word document (or any binary file)
2. Add the documnet to the CVS.
3. Commit
4. Edit the document
5. Commit
6. Look at the revision history for the document.
7. Double click either the first or second revision.

The binary contents are dumped instead to a text view instead of opening MS Word
inside of Eclipse.

Instead it should open the revision in the associated editor.

Normally when working with MS Word documents (e.g. for specifications) in
Eclipse it uses the associated editor.

    <WithStack>There exists no support in the TableViewer for the clear operation in Table.
If the table doesn't use SWT.VIRTUAL, this could (maybe) be worked around by 
calling remove-insert ..

However, when using the virtual option, TableViewer's remove does not update 
the VirtualManager which can cause anything from the wrong object being shown 
(removing chances indeces) to null error being thrown.

Using clear directly on the Table will of course cause a null pointer error 
since item.cached is reset, next time the table needs to display the item 
VirtualManager fails to locate the item in its hash.

Marcel
Tod, someone from SWT who understands both SWT and JFace should review the 
design of the JFace virtual table viewer sometime soon before 3.1.  How about 
me and Vikki?
That would be a good idea Steve. The main issue we are going to have is people 
who play directly with the Table API like this example here.

We have to decide if we want to have some sort of callback mechanism in place 
or tell them just to use what is supplied in TableViewer.

Marcel you can do the same thing by calling refresh on the viewer and updating 
your content provider without this issue but Steve and Vikki should look at my 
implementation so that they can see what the issues are.
Refresh would get the new data displayed (assuming clear isn't called), but 
this solution doesn't apply to my needs. The fact that an item is kept for each 
of the table's lines is already a problem, clearing the data might slightly 
improve that ...

My problem is deeper than that.
I have a HUGE amount of data to display, could be millions of lines.
It is impractical to even create it all even ignoring the memory explosion 
problem. The idea is to use a virtual table, a table that asks for an item 
whenever it needs it.
The Table as is could probably be used this way by clearing data that's not 
displayed at the moment (could keep a cache of a certain size for efficiency if 
user does PgUp-PgDown).

The TableViewer assumes too many things about the data especially small data 
size. The TableViewer should act pretty much like Swing's JTable with model &amp; 
renderer. Unless the user specifies he wants the data to be cached, no caching 
should be done. Caching items increases the memory utilization needlessly, the 
user can control better if to re-generate data if needed of cache it.

I've mentioned before, as well as others, that the contents provider model 
should have a getValueAt(row, col) or at least a getUserItem(row).
The VirtualManager (from what I'm understood from its code) only defers the 
creation of TableItem.

The defence of the current TableViewer design has been (correct me if I'm 
wrong) that if you want to support filtering/sorting this is a must.
The contents modal should be responsible for these. It should be able to decide 
if filtering/sorting is supported and how will this be done on the data.
The viewer should only get data and display it.

Marcel

P.S. - I will revert to v3.0 for now since there I can (in a twisted way) get 
almost the needed behavior.

Marcel see Bug 60117 for the discussion on deferred content providers. We 
don't have a released solution for this yet.
I an equal problem like marcel. (Eclipse M4) I use a TableViewer with the
virtual flag. Initially it is empty. Then data are loaded in the table (e.g. one
row). After a user interaction the table is cleared through advising the
contentprovider to return an array with a length of 0.

This works great. But when I set new datarows again (e.g. 1 row) in the empty
table an Index out of bounds exception occurs:

I analysed the problem and it is the following:
The currentVisibleIndex is only changed in the "setData" - listener attached in
addTableListener() in the TableViewer class.
This listener is activated if a new row is added in the model, but it is not
notificated when the table is "cleared". So on the next internalRefresh the
getCreatedItems() table tries to get the item at the first index of the table,
but the table is empty.
Todd, we must have someone from SWT look at what you are doing.  Keeping a 
current visible index sounds completely wrong to me.
I agree - I think we should work on this together and I think I might have a 
better solution but I want to bounce it off of you.
Upping priority. Steve has some ideas for this sort of thing we may address in 3.2.
Steve, do you remember what ideas Tod is referring to?
From memory and this bug report, Tod was attempting to keep 
a "currentVisibleIndex".  In general, this doesn't make sense.  The operating 
system can ask for the contents of any item at any time, even those that are 
not visible.  We need to determine what problem "currentVisibleIndex" is 
solving and see whether the problem is real and/or if there is already a 
solution in SWT.
There is no "currentVisibleIndex" kept by TableViewer. Regarding the original problem (lacking support for clear/remove), there is a method TableViewer.clear(), and TableViewer.remove(int index) is missing.

Marcel/Martin: Is this still a problem for you?
Removing the target milestone. Please add a comment if you need index-based remove.
Personally, I've worked around this problem by extending the existing class.
I do think that TableViewer should have a remove method and any other mehtod that can be directly accessed in Table, even if it is for soundness only.

    <WithOutStack>There exists no support in the TableViewer for the clear operation in Table.
If the table doesn't use SWT.VIRTUAL, this could (maybe) be worked around by 
calling remove-insert ..

However, when using the virtual option, TableViewer's remove does not update 
the VirtualManager which can cause anything from the wrong object being shown 
(removing chances indeces) to null error being thrown.

Using clear directly on the Table will of course cause a null pointer error 
since item.cached is reset, next time the table needs to display the item 
VirtualManager fails to locate the item in its hash.

Marcel
Tod, someone from SWT who understands both SWT and JFace should review the 
design of the JFace virtual table viewer sometime soon before 3.1.  How about 
me and Vikki?
That would be a good idea Steve. The main issue we are going to have is people 
who play directly with the Table API like this example here.

We have to decide if we want to have some sort of callback mechanism in place 
or tell them just to use what is supplied in TableViewer.

Marcel you can do the same thing by calling refresh on the viewer and updating 
your content provider without this issue but Steve and Vikki should look at my 
implementation so that they can see what the issues are.
Refresh would get the new data displayed (assuming clear isn't called), but 
this solution doesn't apply to my needs. The fact that an item is kept for each 
of the table's lines is already a problem, clearing the data might slightly 
improve that ...

My problem is deeper than that.
I have a HUGE amount of data to display, could be millions of lines.
It is impractical to even create it all even ignoring the memory explosion 
problem. The idea is to use a virtual table, a table that asks for an item 
whenever it needs it.
The Table as is could probably be used this way by clearing data that's not 
displayed at the moment (could keep a cache of a certain size for efficiency if 
user does PgUp-PgDown).

The TableViewer assumes too many things about the data especially small data 
size. The TableViewer should act pretty much like Swing's JTable with model &amp; 
renderer. Unless the user specifies he wants the data to be cached, no caching 
should be done. Caching items increases the memory utilization needlessly, the 
user can control better if to re-generate data if needed of cache it.

I've mentioned before, as well as others, that the contents provider model 
should have a getValueAt(row, col) or at least a getUserItem(row).
The VirtualManager (from what I'm understood from its code) only defers the 
creation of TableItem.

The defence of the current TableViewer design has been (correct me if I'm 
wrong) that if you want to support filtering/sorting this is a must.
The contents modal should be responsible for these. It should be able to decide 
if filtering/sorting is supported and how will this be done on the data.
The viewer should only get data and display it.

Marcel

P.S. - I will revert to v3.0 for now since there I can (in a twisted way) get 
almost the needed behavior.

Marcel see Bug 60117 for the discussion on deferred content providers. We 
don't have a released solution for this yet.
I an equal problem like marcel. (Eclipse M4) I use a TableViewer with the
virtual flag. Initially it is empty. Then data are loaded in the table (e.g. one
row). After a user interaction the table is cleared through advising the
contentprovider to return an array with a length of 0.

This works great. But when I set new datarows again (e.g. 1 row) in the empty
table an Index out of bounds exception occurs: 




I analysed the problem and it is the following:
The currentVisibleIndex is only changed in the "setData" - listener attached in
addTableListener() in the TableViewer class.
This listener is activated if a new row is added in the model, but it is not
notificated when the table is "cleared". So on the next internalRefresh the
getCreatedItems() table tries to get the item at the first index of the table,
but the table is empty.

Veronika,

The default settings are those used by CVS (i.e. if you committed using the 
CVS command line, so files would be ignored and DLLs would not). Could you 
enter a bug report for this? I am hesitant to change the global ignore since 
it is consistent with CVS and may affect other users. A better solution would 
be to support project level settings that are persisted with the project in 
the repository. We could disable the global setting temporarily until the 
project settings are supported. Of course, nothing will happen unless we have 
a bug report;-)

Hi Michael,

SWT broke the Integration build this morning because we forgot to release the 
libraries on Solaris.  The reason we forgot to do this is because *.so files 
are ignored by default in the Team -&gt; Ignored Resources list.  I do not 
understand why *.so files are ignored but *.dll  files are not.

Could you please remove *.so, *.a and *.exec from the list of default ignored 
files?  Since we often need to compile our libraries in a brand new workspace, 
it is a real problem to have these ignored by default.

Thank you,
Veronika

I have been noticing this once in a while: when running Core's test suite, the
JUnit view will present one of the test cases that have not been executed yet
(e.g.: Foo.testYetToRun()) as "passed"(the green check mark), and will seem to
have skipped one of the test cases (e.g. Bar.testAlreadyRun()) in a test suite
already run. Double clicking Foo.testYetToRun() on the JUnit view, actually
opens Bar.testAlreadyRun() in the Java editor. Double clicking
Bar.testAlreadyRun() will open the Java editor on the appropriate file/method.

So it seems the tests are executed properly, by the JUnit view is for some
reason getting confused and mixing up totally unrelated test cases.

Here, testVariableChanged has not been executed yet, but shows as such. Double
clicking it opens a completely unrelated test case (showing in the Java
editor).
most likely a dup of bug 78618. You're running on J9, right? If not reopen.

Create a new project "P" with a plugin class (I kept the default options)
You will notice that a package named "p" (notice the lower case).
Then, using the editor I create a new application extension.
When I create the "run" attribute, the following class name is proposed:
 "P.PlatformRunnable"

You will notice that the case is invalid (P should be p). This later causes
problem when I try to create the class using the "class*" link. Indeed when I
click OK in the wizard I get the really unfriendly message "A resource exists
with a different case ....".

Two fixes should be done:
- fix pde so the class has the right case.
- fix the wizard so I do not get the unfriendly message.
can't reproduce this in RC7, Wassim?

No error dialog, and nothing in the log.
this is a pde issue (I think you can dup it against an existing bug)
Upping severity as this prevents use of the site editor.

There also needs to be an accessible way of adding selected features to the
Publish pane.


Nick, you can copy and paste.

Konrad, we have seen this one before, but were unable to reproduce.  If you 
are able to, please make it go away one way (fixing it) or another (getting 
rid of the drag and drop altogether).
While it's nice to have Copy and Paste work consistently with DnD, I think it
would be more obvious here to have &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; buttons (aka a slush bucket).

Fixed with redesigned site editor.  Features are always published.  DnD should 
work better as well.</WithStack>

Alternatively, it should fail early with a PartInitException from its initialize

Collection
Engine
All,

This issue was discussed during the TPTP coordination meeting yesterday 
and last week's marketing group meeting. The final decision is that the 
component is to be called the "agent controller".

To summarise the key points of the discussion, the term "data 
collection" was felt to be too narrow in its scope, as the component 
will eventually encompass execution as well as collection capabilities. 
Some concerns regarding the current over-use of the word "agent" were 
raised, but the majority vote went to the term "agent controller".

Many thanks once again to all who participated in this discussion, and 
in particular to Nellie for all her help and advice to the marketing 
group on this matter.

Best regards,

Melanie

Created attachment 16070
For your convenience I attached a patch containing the fixes
There were a lot of plugins in this attachment that were unrelated to test,
including trace, logging and probekit stuff.  I committed all fo the changes
except a couple of problems in these two patches:

org.eclipse.hyades.nls.txt
org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.views.nl1.txt

It seems like the patch mechanism in eclipse is not properly handling UTF-8
encoding, as the patch files will not properly apply.  I was going to fix these
by hand, but I noticed many places in these files where the Agent was referred
to as the IBM Remote Agent Controller, and the replacement in the patch file was
IBM Agent Controller.  I thought it was the case that we do not include IBM in
the name either, but since it's the last day to make changes in 3.2i2, I didn't
want to guess wrong.  Can you please address these two plugins?

Thanks,
--Joe
The two nl plugins are not required to be updated since they will be 
regenerated on the next TVT cycle.

including trace, logging and probekit stuff.  I committed all fo the changes
except a couple of problems in these two patches:

org.eclipse.hyades.nls.txt
org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.views.nl1.txt

It seems like the patch mechanism in eclipse is not properly handling UTF-8
encoding, as the patch files will not properly apply.  I was going to fix these
by hand, but I noticed many places in these files where the Agent was referred
to as the IBM Remote Agent Controller, and the replacement in the patch file was
IBM Agent Controller.  I thought it was the case that we do not include IBM in
the name either, but since it's the last day to make changes in 3.2i2, I didn't
want to guess wrong.  Can you please address these two plugins?

Thanks,

The two nl plugins are not required to be updated since they will be 
regenerated on the next TVT cycle.

Subject:	[hyades-dev] RE: Naming of the Agent Controller/Hyades Data 
Collection
Engine
All,

This issue was discussed during the TPTP coordination meeting yesterday 
and last week's marketing group meeting. The final decision is that the 
component is to be called the "agent controller".

To summarise the key points of the discussion, the term "data 
collection" was felt to be too narrow in its scope, as the component 
will eventually encompass execution as well as collection capabilities. 
Some concerns regarding the current over-use of the word "agent" were 
raised, but the majority vote went to the term "agent controller".

Many thanks once again to all who participated in this discussion, and 
in particular to Nellie for all her help and advice to the marketing 
group on this matter.

Best regards,

Melanie

For your convenience I attached a patch containing the fixes
The patch attached for the Probekit component is actually a non-change. It 
happened because a JET plugin created a .jetproperties file. There is nothing 
to change in Probekit so I'm closing this as WONTFIX.
