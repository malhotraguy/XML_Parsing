    <WithStack>A long time ago, I got in the habit of instrumenting EventTable so that I could 
track down responsiveness problems.  The idea is that if a listener takes too 
long to process an event, then it should be noted. 
 
Unfortunately, this isn't a permanent feature in SWT, so it is hard for others 
to use this technique.  They either have to know what code to change, or find 
and apply a patch to SWT. 
 
I'm proposing a mechanism similar to the current debug flags that Platform UI 
uses.  This way, we could hook it up to the tracing options mechanism.  This 
way, turning on this kind of debugging is as easy as modifying a launch 
configuration. 
 
I'll attach a patch.
Created attachment 16134
Patch to "org.eclipse.swt"

The creation of PRETTY_PRINT_NAMES table in EventTable is perhaps overkill. 
It's nice because people who don't know SWT intimately (like me) don't tend to
know the event type constants by heart.  If you don't want this, then it could
be removed and only the numeric event type printed.  (You need to know the
event type so you know which method on a SWTEventListener is going to be called
by TypedListener.)
Created attachment 16135
Patch to "org.eclipse.ui"

Adds two options to the ".options" file.
Created attachment 16136
Patch to "org.eclipse.ui.workbench"

Takes the two options and pushes them into SWT display when we create it.
If SWT applies this patch, then could you please punt the bug back to Platform 
UI when you're done?  (So we can apply our patches....) 
Looks interesting. Patching the event table will only gather statistics for 
untyped Listeners.  Perhaps a standard typed listener collection class should 
be added and used by the custom controls and the other components of SWT.  
This class could also be instrumented.

VI, SN and SSQ to evaluate the patch to figure out how this kind of 
functionality can be embedded in SWT.
This would make a big difference to the performance instrumentation that we are
going to turn on during M6 and M7. We have noticed some Java editor operations
taking a long time on keystrokes and we need to investigate them.
Adding my name to the cc list as we are now tracking performance issues more
closely. Please remove the performance keyword if this is not a performance bug.

It's a good idea that fell off a cliff.  Since it involves API, we can't 
really make changes for 3.1 ... however, we might be able to make available 
patched versions of these classes for performance work by attaching them to 
this bug report in the same way that Doug has done.

My thinking in the long term is to add API to all filters to run either before 
or after an event, rather than add custom profiling API.  An application that 
is interested in profiling would hook both filters and maintain a stack.
Re comment #8: "Since it involves API, we can't really make changes for 3.1"

Changes that add new, non-breaking API, specifically to fix performance issues, can still be made with 
the approval of one PMC team member.

- press Alt+Q, which is not a mnemonic for any of the TabFolder's tabs
  -&gt; on motif this results in a Q being inserted into the Text

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display display = new Display ();
	final Shell shell = new Shell(display);
	shell.setBounds(10,10,200,200);
	TabFolder folder = new TabFolder(shell, SWT.NONE);
	folder.setBounds(10,10,150,150);
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
		TabItem item = new TabItem(folder, SWT.NONE);
		item.setText("i&amp;" + i);
		Text text = new Text(folder, SWT.NONE);
		text.setBounds(10,10,50,50);

	}
	shell.open();
	while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
	}
	display.dispose();
}
Actually the issue is not the TabFolder, but the Text's willingness to accept 
and show a key that was pressed with Alt:

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display display = new Display();
	Shell shell = new Shell(display);
	shell.setBounds(10,10,200,200);
	Text text = new Text(shell, SWT.MULTI);
	text.setBounds(10,10,100,100);
	shell.open();
	while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
	}
	display.dispose();
}

Verified with a C snippet that this is actually correct native behaviour, so 
there's nothing to do here.  Closing report.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The session test framework runs a single test case per session. This is usually
what we want, but there are cases when we want to hole a bunch of test cases in
the same session. For instance, running a test suite with some command line
option, and then running it again without that command line option. Running
every single test case as a separate session just makes it take longer and
brings no value.

An acceptable implementation would be that this set of test cases would be made
of all test cases found in a given class.
The changes required to support that are not trivial. Won't fix any soon.
This actually got fixed recently.

That looks fine to me. What would you expect?
if (args.length &lt;= 5) {
	if (args.length &lt; 3)
		System.out.println("KO");
} else
	System.out.println("OK");
That's the same, brackets are not required there.

'if (args.length &lt; 3)
   System.out.println("KO");'

is one statement.

Note that you can use quick assist on the 'if' to add brackets if you like.
For me, it's not the same at all.
When I execute 

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		args = new String[6];
		if (args.length &gt; 5)
			System.out.println("OK");
		else
			if (args.length &lt; 3)
				System.out.println("KO");
	}

OK in written in the console.
After the quick fix execution :

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		args = new String[6];
		if (args.length &lt;= 5) //(1)
			if (args.length &lt; 3) // (2)
				System.out.println("KO");
		else
			System.out.println("OK"); // goes with if at (1)
	}

nothing is written because "else System.out.println("OK")" goes with "if
(args.length &lt; 3) " instead of "if (args.length &lt;= 5)"

As seen in the Java Language Specification 14.5:

"The Java programming language, like C and C++ and many programming languages
before them, arbitrarily decree that an else clause belongs to the innermost if
to which it might possibly belong"

    <WithStack>This name doesn't fit well with the rest of the launch configuration types. The 
way all the Eclipse types are named is as a noun, i.e. the thing we're 
profiling. But here, we're not profiling an "Attach - Java Process", we're 
profiling a running application. I would suggest the name "Running Java 
Application", just like the debugger has. Although, these two are incompatible 
and shouldn't be shared among modes.
Any thoughts Eugene/Valentina ?
This is a tough one. It is hard to tie/rename "Attach" into a "Launch" action 
actually. Profile a "running java application" sounds okay to me. 
As a note, downstream product contains an "Attach to a Running Process" entry 
in the debug launcher. If we stick with the terminology here then less 
confusion to users.
I agree.. we should be consistent with the debugger.

Sorry, I didn't make it clear: the error not only occurrs in the above mentioned
example but also everytime I try to make a test in JUnit
is this a standard eclipse installation? I couldn't find a class
'org.eclipse.jdt.junit.TestManipulatorManager'
The only thing I did was installing some Plugins(PHPeclipse, JFacedDB, Omondo)
and the mentioned JUnit in my Java-lib-directory. 

And strangely, neither can I find the
'org.eclipse.jdt.junit.TestManipulatorManager' class. Maybe however, I looked in
the wrong place (Eclipse-Plugin-Dir, org.eclipse.jdt.* subdirs)?
you must also have installed the continuous testing plug-ins, these plug-ins
replace jdt.junit. Recommend to report the bug report there.
That's it. Although I can't remember it, I must have installed these plug-ins.
After deleting them, it finally works.</WithStack>

I've seen this hang as well.  GTK+ 2.2.1.  Are you sure about the Eclipse 
version?  And have you talked to Silenio about this? 
I'm sure of the GTK+ version.  Note that the UI was not blocked and was able to
respond to expose and resize events, so I do not think this is an SWT problem.
Do you remember having cancelled the OpenType dialog opening prior to hanging ?
No, I don't recall having done that. 
I cannot reproduce using GTK+2.2.1 and last integration build I200411240800.
Billy, have you seen this hang recently ? If you have, do you have anything
related to indexing in your .log file ?
I am able to reproduce this one.

Make sure you start up Eclipse with a *closed* Java project. After startup, open
the project and then Open Type. The progress dialog will be there forever. The
Cancel button is active though.

Before the Open Type works again, I have to rebuild the project and restart Eclipse.

Ringo
Forgot to mention:

Eclipse 3.1M3 on Windows 2000 with JDK 1.4.2_05. I am still running M3 since
post-M3 builds annoy me due to Bug 73969.

Ringo
Has the JDT Core team managed to reproduce the problem using the steps given by Ringo?

Note: If it is taking a long time to open, then it's a performance problem. If it *hangs* (i.e. never opens) 
then it's a bug whose priority should probably be raised.
I doubt we can reproduce this PR using HEAD since the AllTypesCache was 
removed last week.
Time spent in scenario described by Ringo is to index files of the reopened
project(s).

Here are times noticed on an Eclipse 3.1 full source workspace (86 projects):
 1) Close all projects: ~45s
 2) Open all projects: ~7 s
 3) Index all files (~10600): ~30s

So, time to index all files sounds definitely reasonable...

Moreover, this scenario should happen seldom as user does not close/open often
big projects and even if it happens, indexing progress is shown to user in
dialog. So, he cannot longer feel that eclipse is currently hanging.

Due to all these reasons, I close this bug as FIXED.
Re: "Close all projects: ~45s"
   Just out of curiosity, why does it take 45 seconds to *close* all the projects. If the projects are all closed, 
then there should be nothing to index. It seems like it should be almost instant.
Mike,
I didn't say that index take 45s while closing project. AFAIK, there's no
indexing during this operation. I put this time just to make indexing time
relative to other operations on same number of projects...
Apologies Fred. I misread. 

Adding JA to CC list to answer the question: Why does closing all projects take 45s?
I have entered Bug 94436 to investigate performance of closing projects.  This
does have to do significant work, since it saves the project subtree to disk. 
Other PRE_CLOSE resource change listeners might also be adding some time.
Verified for 3.1 M7 using build I20050509-2010 + jdt.core HEAD.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I got this hang when I hit Ctrl-Shift-T.

I've seen this hang as well.  GTK+ 2.2.1.  Are you sure about the Eclipse 
version?  And have you talked to Silenio about this? 
I'm sure of the GTK+ version.  Note that the UI was not blocked and was able to
respond to expose and resize events, so I do not think this is an SWT problem.
Do you remember having cancelled the OpenType dialog opening prior to hanging ?
No, I don't recall having done that. 
I cannot reproduce using GTK+2.2.1 and last integration build I200411240800.
Billy, have you seen this hang recently ? If you have, do you have anything
related to indexing in your .log file ?
I am able to reproduce this one.

Make sure you start up Eclipse with a *closed* Java project. After startup, open
the project and then Open Type. The progress dialog will be there forever. The
Cancel button is active though.

Before the Open Type works again, I have to rebuild the project and restart Eclipse.

Ringo
Forgot to mention:

Eclipse 3.1M3 on Windows 2000 with JDK 1.4.2_05. I am still running M3 since
post-M3 builds annoy me due to Bug 73969.

Ringo
Has the JDT Core team managed to reproduce the problem using the steps given by Ringo?

Note: If it is taking a long time to open, then it's a performance problem. If it *hangs* (i.e. never opens) 
then it's a bug whose priority should probably be raised.
I doubt we can reproduce this PR using HEAD since the AllTypesCache was 
removed last week.
Time spent in scenario described by Ringo is to index files of the reopened
project(s).

Here are times noticed on an Eclipse 3.1 full source workspace (86 projects):
 1) Close all projects: ~45s
 2) Open all projects: ~7 s
 3) Index all files (~10600): ~30s

So, time to index all files sounds definitely reasonable...

Moreover, this scenario should happen seldom as user does not close/open often
big projects and even if it happens, indexing progress is shown to user in
dialog. So, he cannot longer feel that eclipse is currently hanging.

Due to all these reasons, I close this bug as FIXED.
Re: "Close all projects: ~45s"
   Just out of curiosity, why does it take 45 seconds to *close* all the projects. If the projects are all closed, 
then there should be nothing to index. It seems like it should be almost instant.
Mike,
I didn't say that index take 45s while closing project. AFAIK, there's no
indexing during this operation. I put this time just to make indexing time
relative to other operations on same number of projects...
Apologies Fred. I misread. 

Adding JA to CC list to answer the question: Why does closing all projects take 45s?
I have entered Bug 94436 to investigate performance of closing projects.  This
does have to do significant work, since it saves the project subtree to disk. 
Other PRE_CLOSE resource change listeners might also be adding some time.
Verified for 3.1 M7 using build I20050509-2010 + jdt.core HEAD.</WithOutStack>

I realized that EclipseLog does not know about severity or error code, which are
part of Eclipse's log format. It is then up to the clients to provide that
information as part of the "entry" string (ensuring the format is correct).

The result is that clients going directly to the FrameworkLog API (such as the
framework itself and update.configurator) generate log entries that do not
conform to the expected format, so PDE's log viewer ends up having problems to
parse the file (cannot parse the date, for instance).

Here is an !ENTRY line for a log entry generated by the framework:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2004-11-25 10:55:43.378

Here is an !ENTRY line for a log entry generated by an Eclipse plug-in:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui.ide 4 4 2004-11-24 11:15:37.429

I cannot think of any nice fix for this that does not involve adding "severity"
and "error code" to FrameworkLogEntry.
I suspect that this is why it does not know about severity or error code.
A stupid proposition/question, why could not we automatically add two random
values to the message when logged by the framework log?

That would require every client to be changed to prepend a "0 0 " string to the
log entry message. Or we could check in the log implementation whether the log
entry message starts with two numbers, and add "0 " strings if needed. Either
way, I don't like these solutions very much (comparing to adding the two fields
to FrameworkLogEntry or a subclass of it).

yup, this is a dup.  Thanks John.

    <WithStack>I installed the new beta version of Tiger and the last stable version of Eclipse
(3.0.1).

When I try to expand a 'category' (the thing with little triangle that turn on
itself and found everywhere in Eclipse like in the left menu in 'preferences' )
I receive a message popup :
Title : "Internal Error"
Message : "An SWT error occured."
"You are recommanded to exit the workbench."
"Subsequent errors may happen and may terminate the without warning"
"See the .log file for more details."

"Do you want to exit the workbench?"

I suppose that a problem with Apple...
CAR to investigate when we get Tiger.  In the mean time, Andre, can you 
recreate this?  Thanks.
Yes, I can reproduce this problem on Mac OS X 10.4 (8A294)
with Eclipse 3.0.1 but *not* with HEAD (that is 3.1) or other recent 3.1 builds.

So I think this bug can be closed.

However, with Eclipse 3.1 the following (Apple) debug output appears on the Console when expanding
a TreeNode for the first time:

I think we need to leave it open to investigate the warning and to determine 
whether we need to fix this for 3.0.2 under Tiger.
The warning no longer appears in Mac OS X 10.4 (8A393).
Suggest to close.
Ok but if the bug comes back, reopen ASAP.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I installed the new beta version of Tiger and the last stable version of Eclipse
(3.0.1).

When I try to expand a 'category' (the thing with little triangle that turn on
itself and found everywhere in Eclipse like in the left menu in 'preferences' )
I receive a message popup :
Title : "Internal Error"
Message : "An SWT error occured."
"You are recommanded to exit the workbench."
"Subsequent errors may happen and may terminate the without warning"
"See the .log file for more details."

"Do you want to exit the workbench?"

When I look in the .log file I have the following stacktrace :



I suppose that a problem with Apple...
CAR to investigate when we get Tiger.  In the mean time, Andre, can you 
recreate this?  Thanks.
Yes, I can reproduce this problem on Mac OS X 10.4 (8A294)
with Eclipse 3.0.1 but *not* with HEAD (that is 3.1) or other recent 3.1 builds.

So I think this bug can be closed.

However, with Eclipse 3.1 the following (Apple) debug output appears on the Console when expanding
a TreeNode for the first time:

After meeting with vlad, I can handle this.
Although the scanner discovery may be need this, it is not dependent.
Vlad the part one is done.

    <WithStack>I often work in 3 branchs of the same project at the same time.  Using
ctrl-shift-r to open files in quite handy but it would be nice if I could
de-select projects that files will be listed from.  If a list of projects with
checkboxes on the open resource dialog appears and I could select/unselect open
projects and it would remember which ones were selected that would be very helpful.
I believe this can already be accomplished via working sets...Tod?
As they are the same project I think this is a lot tougher to do - you  can 
always set working sets on a set of projects.
The same functionality does exist in working sets _but_ if I have four projects
and I need all possible permutations of those four projects listed then it is
quite complicated to create that set of working sets and select/unselect them.

Let's take my example of four projects (a,b,c,d).  If I want the open-resources
to only open resources from a and d then I need a working set of projects a and
d.  Now my math is a little rusty but all permutations of abcd is going to be at
least 6 working sets (ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd).  

Those 6 working sets are also going to be a lot harder to select and use -
ignoring the creation aspect anytime my project set changes - than 4 check boxes
on the open resources dialog.

 
moving Open Resource related bugs to Szymon.
Szymon, please move between you and Krystof as needed.  Let me know if you have any questions.  These are all the bugs I had related to OpenResource.
This can already be achieved via working sets.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I often work in 3 branchs of the same project at the same time.  Using
ctrl-shift-r to open files in quite handy but it would be nice if I could
de-select projects that files will be listed from.  If a list of projects with
checkboxes on the open resource dialog appears and I could select/unselect open
projects and it would remember which ones were selected that would be very helpful.
I believe this can already be accomplished via working sets...Tod?
As they are the same project I think this is a lot tougher to do - you  can 
always set working sets on a set of projects.
The same functionality does exist in working sets _but_ if I have four projects
and I need all possible permutations of those four projects listed then it is
quite complicated to create that set of working sets and select/unselect them.

Theme: simple to use
Currently there is no way to rerun a correlation or update the logs information 
for that correlation. The user has to create a new correlation with the same 
information in order to recorrelate the data.
The requirement is to be able to update existing correlation by adding or 
removing logs. A Properties popup action or double click on the selected 
correlation should open the existing 'Create New Correlation wizard', with 
fields updated based on selected correlation ( see screencap below ).The user 
can update the correlation information ( correlation name, add/remove logs, 
change the correlation type ), then finish the wizard. At this point, selected 
logs are recorrelated based on selected correlation type.

deow (rather than calls(String) which produces the correct error message).
compiler now handles this gracefully and emits the appropriate error messages.</WithOutStack>

Which build are you using?
Possible dup of bug 79448.
Probably is. I'm using I20041123. Sorry about that.
It is a duplicate, indeed. Thanks anyway. Please keep the PRs coming. 

I will make a patch available off Core's development resources page contaning
this and other fixes for people using this build. I will send a message to
platform-core-dev when done.

Leaving this one open until I have done that.
Patch is available at:

http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/downloads.html

Done. Marking as duplicate.

    <WithStack>The crash occurs in Azureus, once a torrent has been "checked". I first
presented them with the bug, but based on the log output (below) from "java",
the crash was in the SWT code and I was told to report the bug here. Below is
the log generated by jre 1.5.0.

Richard: 

What is your system? AMD64, Xeon, IA_64?
Which SWT build are you using? (Linux GTK AMD64?)
Your JVM appears to be Sun 1.5 AMD64.
amd64

I think I'm using the 64-bit swt build ... the .so libraries that are packaged
with azureus have a 3106 tag on the end (if that indicates version number at all
for you).

And yes, the JVM is Sun 1.5 amd64
64 bit crash - possibly another vararg problem?

void        g_object_set                    (gpointer object,
                                             const gchar *first_property_name,
                                             ...);

Ouch, maybe.  We don't set any floats though...  I'll try to see if I can
reproduce it.  This will only happen when someone has set a per-row property in
a table (foreground, background, font)...
Increasing the severity.  This bug kind of got forgotten but it must be looked
at before 3.1.
Ok, it's before 3.1.  Any more on it?
I did a bunch of tests on our x86-64 machine and made sure the code from the
stack trace got hit.  I saw no crashes.  The code has somewhat changed since
when the bug was filed, so maybe this has been fixed already.

I am going to mark this as WORKSFORME.  Please re-open if you still see crashes
like this using 3.1RC3 or newer.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>The crash occurs in Azureus, once a torrent has been "checked". I first
presented them with the bug, but based on the log output (below) from "java",
the crash was in the SWT code and I was told to report the bug here. Below is
the log generated by jre 1.5.0.

Richard: 

What is your system? AMD64, Xeon, IA_64?
Which SWT build are you using? (Linux GTK AMD64?)
Your JVM appears to be Sun 1.5 AMD64.
amd64

I think I'm using the 64-bit swt build ... the .so libraries that are packaged
with azureus have a 3106 tag on the end (if that indicates version number at all
for you).

And yes, the JVM is Sun 1.5 amd64
64 bit crash - possibly another vararg problem?

void        g_object_set                    (gpointer object,
                                             const gchar *first_property_name,
                                             ...);

Ouch, maybe.  We don't set any floats though...  I'll try to see if I can
reproduce it.  This will only happen when someone has set a per-row property in
a table (foreground, background, font)...
Increasing the severity.  This bug kind of got forgotten but it must be looked
at before 3.1.
Ok, it's before 3.1.  Any more on it?
I did a bunch of tests on our x86-64 machine and made sure the code from the
stack trace got hit.  I saw no crashes.  The code has somewhat changed since
when the bug was filed, so maybe this has been fixed already.

I am going to mark this as WORKSFORME.  Please re-open if you still see crashes
like this using 3.1RC3 or newer.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>The build.xml for org.eclipse.gtk*'s build.xml for the gather.bin.parts target
needs to incorporate collecting swt libraries that are compiled during a source
build.  To accommodate this, I think we need to add the ${arch} value to the
lines starting with * below

&lt;target name="gather.bin.parts" depends="init" if="destination.temp.folder"&gt;
		&lt;mkdir dir="${destination.temp.folder}/${full.name}/ws/gtk"/&gt;
		&lt;copy file="${build.result.folder}/ws/gtk/swt-pi.jar"
todir="${destination.temp.folder}/${full.name}/ws/gtk"/&gt;
		&lt;copy file="${build.result.folder}/ws/gtk/swt-mozilla.jar"
todir="${destination.temp.folder}/${full.name}/ws/gtk"/&gt;
		&lt;copy file="${build.result.folder}/ws/gtk/swt.jar"
todir="${destination.temp.folder}/${full.name}/ws/gtk"/&gt;
		&lt;copy todir="${destination.temp.folder}/${full.name}"&gt;
			&lt;fileset dir="${basedir}"
*includes="fragment.properties,fragment.xml,about.html,lgpl-v21.txt,mpl-v11.txt,cpl-v10.html,os/${os}/${arch}/,META-INF/"/&gt;
		&lt;/copy&gt;
	  	&lt;chmod perm="755"
*dir="${destination.temp.folder}/${full.name}/os/${os}/${arch}"
includes="**/*.so*" /&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
Chrix to decode.  The build process is utter magic to me.
i believe this was just done with Kim this afternoon.
One of the problem with the build last night was that in the
org.eclipse.swt.gtk* script changes this line was missing a slash after arch

*includes="fragment.properties,fragment.xml,about.html,lgpl-v21.txt,mpl-v11.txt,cpl-v10.html,os/${os}/${arch},META-INF/"/&gt;

so the current
os/${os}/${arch}

should be
os/${os}/${arch}/ 

We modified this our our build machine and the build completed without a problem.

This exposed a problem where the org.eclipse.rcp feature.xml had both gtk and
gtk64 fragments for the amd64 drop which we have fixed.

Please let me know when it is completed so I can run a test build and ensure
that there are not any problems for tonight :-)

		...
	}

When I get to the call doRealStuff(..), I'm rarely interested in stepping into
getName() and new SubProgressMonitor(..). Instead, the most common action is to
manually place the caret into the outermost method doRealStuff and invoke Run &gt;
Step Into Selection.

What I request is a command 'Step Into Outermost' with which I can do 'step
into' without stepping into method invocations inside the outermost method
invocation.

This doesn't need to be a new command - it could also be combined with Step Into
Selection: When the caret is not at a place where you can step into, that action
could just step into the next method invocation to the right of the current
caret position. I.e. when the caret is at the beginnig of the line
		doRealStuff(getName(), new SubProgressMonitor(pm, 1);
, I could:
a) Step Into: goes into getName()
b) Step Over: goes to next line
c) Step Into Selection / Step Into Outermost: goes into doRealStuff(..)
Marking as later. May consider in a later milestone, depending on resources.

Patch

Here's a patch that implements the requested functionality inside the Step Into Selection action.
Re-openig to review patch.
Not committed for 3.3. Instead we're planning on hyperlink debugging (bug 112630). Markus, can we mark this as a duplicate? Or would you still want this specific feature?
Hyperlink debugging sounds interesting for mouse aficionados, but I will probably not use it much for 2 reasons:

1) I prefer using the keyboard, and hyperlinks can only be activated by mouse

2) It still requires me to manually point to the method name "doRealStuff" in the scenario from comment 0. After a series of Step Over (F6), the mouse cursor is usually far away from the method name. If Step Into Selection (F9 in my workspace) would just do what I need, then my next debugging step would be just 1 keystroke away - unbeatably quick and convenient.

I would strongly prefer a mouseless solution. My patch is still applicable, works, and does not change anything for the original usage path of Step Into Selection, so I think you should just release it ;-).

Deferring.

Wow.  I'm very impressed with Mr. Keller actually offering a working patch.  Why is this being deferred?  Since it is a duplicate of a bug which has been deferred for 3-1/2 years, I hope Mr. Keller isn't looking for a quick resolution.

Darin, what's the reason for not using the suggested fix? Is the code not good enough or do you think this feature could cause harm to some users (I can't imagine why, since it only replaces an error condition with useful behavior)?

I can update the patch to HEAD if that would raise the chances of getting this feature (would have to copy StepIntoSelectionUtils#getMethod() back to StepIntoSelectionActionDelegate to avoid wrong behavior in StepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector).
I have not had a chance to review the patch (or it's been a while). I think Mike said there was an issue when code was split over several lines? We can look at it again in 3.4.
&gt; I think Mike said there was an issue when code was split over several lines?

'Issue' or 'feature', that's the question;-). My approach only enters the next method invocation on the current line. IMO, it would become confusing if 'Step into Selection' would go further than the current line to find a target. I would argue that the 'Selection' means
- the selected region, or if that's empty
- the caret position, or if that's not in a method
- the next method on the selected (current) line
Yeah when I was playing with the patch it did not work over more than one line. In this case though I guess it comes down to how we want to define 'current line' do we want it to only be the current line of text or the current executable line....I felt that it should work for broken lines as well.

For example it should work for:

1. doSomething(getSomeText(), getSomeMoreText());

 AND

2. doSomething(


       getSomeText(), 
       getSomeMoreText()

       );

In both cases if I have the caret in the method call getSomeMoreText() I should be able to step into doSomething()

Just my two cents though...
&gt; In both cases if I have the caret in the method call getSomeMoreText() I should
&gt; be able to step into doSomething()

That could make sense if "Step into Outermost Method Invocation" was a separate command. We could discuss that approach, but I find the extension of "Step into Selection" by far more elegant (and it also saves a command/action/keybinding/...).

If you accept this solution, then the only case I see where it does not work with broken lines is this:

3.
    before();
    |
    doSomething(getSomeText(), getSomeMoreText());

If you manually put the caret into the line between 'before' and 'doSomething' (note that the debugger never puts the caret to that line!), then my patch does not find 'doSomething'. Arguments for this behavior are comment 12 and predictably good performance, since the scanner does not potentially spend a lot of time scanning all following lines for a possible target.

Reopening, since this is in fact not a dup of bug 44101. Bug 44101 is about changing the default behavior of "Step Into", but this bug wants "Step Into Outermost" or an enhanced "Step Into Selection". (I disagree with bug 44101, since I think "Step Into" should not depend on the caret position but always step into the next method that the VM enters.)
This feature is at odds with bug 44067. This feature requests that "step into selection" should step into the outermost method (or caret position method) when there is no selection. Bug 44067 suggests that step into selection should just perform a "step into".

Jerome, what are your feelings on this?
*** Bug 44067 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
OK, Jerome's request is the same as this - he wants to step into the next method.
+1 for this feature.
Created attachment 73414
Patch (updated to HEAD)
Tested and applied patch. It does not change the default behavior of step into selection but catches one single edge case where it can step into the first method to the right of the current caret position. Maybe it should have been called step into next selected method?

    <WithStack>If the summary is unclear, here is the situation:

I attempt to complete the CDT debug tutorial, but cannot give input for the "cin" statement, thus not 
being able to step through interactive command-line code.  There are many ways to resolve this, such 
as allowing a custom launch commands or just attaching to the "console" window like when merely 
running the executable.

I am not sure if this matters if the program to be debugged is an X11 graphical app or regular Carbon/
Cocoa gui app.  Perhaps I can test that later.
I tried building/running a simple QT (gui) program and got  "&lt;testProgName&gt;: cannot connect to X 
server".  X11 is installed, however, so I figured the running Env was lacked something.  After setting 
DISPLAY to 0:0 in the Run... Environment tab I was able to successfully run the graphical QT app both in 
"Run" and "Debug".

In doing this I discovered a slight flaw in the "step return" command in that it will not appropriately find 
files outside of the project working directory.  For instance, I stepped into a QT library routine and 
Eclipse asked for the directory where this file lives (C/C++ File Editor... Source not found.  You can 
attach a new source...) because "&lt;some relative path that looks correct if used from the root of the 
project directory and not from eclipse's default workspace&gt;" didn't work.

Yes that is the correct way to do it.  You must specified to the Xlib library
which display to use, Unless :
(1) you start eclipse with DISPLAY environment set
(2) When launching the program you set the DISPLAY environment.

(1) is simpler since for new launch it will automatically inherit the
Eclipse environment.

That is still correct in this a limitatio of Eclipse/CDT, but you can
add where the external sources are located in the source locator of the
launch.

If you still have problem with it the source locator please make a new
PR so we can deal with it.</WithStack>

When I debug a C/C++ program from Eclipse, the output of gdb gets mixed up 
with the output of program [in Eclipse console]. It's extremely painful to 
find the output of the program from the console. I guess the o/p of gdb and 
that of program are re-directed to the same stream ? Though pin console 
filters the gdb's responses, I would like to have the o/p of gdb in some other 
console so that I don't miss any of them ;-)

- Ragav.
&gt; I guess the o/p of gdb and that of program are re-directed to the same 
stream ?
No, the outputs of gdb and program are two separate streams.

As far as I understand you are mistaking the Console view and consoles. Each 
project in the Debug view has accosiated console. When a project is selected 
the Console view displays the console associated with it.
When a console is not pinned the Console view displays the console with latest 
output. That's why you probably have an impression that output is mixed.  
Thanks for the clarification Mikhail. Well how can I separate the o/p of the 
debugger from that of the program and see the o/p of the program [alone] in 
the Console window.

This problem is not occuring when I debug a Java program. Why should CDT 
behave like this ? Is this the intended behavior ?

&gt;Well how can I separate the o/p of the 
&gt;debugger from that of the program and see the o/p of the program [alone] in 
&gt;the Console window.

The output is NOT mixed. The whole Eclipse debug framework is driven by the 
selection in the Debug view. Each debug session is presented by the set fo 
targets and processes. Each process has a console associated with it. To see 
the output of a process select it in the Debug view. Make sure that your 
console is not pinned. 
A regular CDT debug session has two processes. The first one represents the 
program being debugged. Another process is associated with the underlying 
debugger - gdb. To see the output of any of these processes simple select it in 
the Debug view. If you don't want the Console view to switch to another output 
pin it by using the "Pin console" button.

&gt;This problem is not occuring when I debug a Java program. 
Because when you debug a Java program you have one process (Java VM) that acts 
as a debugger and a debuggee as well.

&gt;Why should CDT behave like this ? Is this the intended behavior ?
In CDT many people use the gdb console to drive the debugger. More on this 
issue see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=57602 and 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=69425.

    <WithStack>hello,

there is currently a feature which displays that a method is overriding a method
of a super class or interface. This can be done in the overview and/or vertical
ruler.
What would also be very interesting is the opposite. Sometimes it would be
helpful to know if this method you're working on is overridden by some other
class in the project/workspace. 
 If it is not possible to have an annotation in some of the ruler a search
option would be very nice. Something like "search overriding classes in
project/workspace".

regards,

matthias hanisch
The problem is of course performance. Getting all subtypes can take minutes e.g.
for Object.

What we offer here is CTRL+T on the method that shows you all methods that
override the given method
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I've found a problem with sharing launch configurations. Well, it's mainly a
ClearCase problem but the ClearCase people were telling us that they are unable
to fix it because it would require to much changes. 

ClearCase limits the line legth of text files (also xml files) to 8000
characters or so. Now I have a shared launch configuration which has a line
length of 19850 characters. That's too much for ClearCase. I guess they hard
coded the limit is several places. That's why they are unable to fix it.

The problematic element is a org.eclipse.debug.core.source_locator_memento
stringAttribute. The value seems to contain encoded xml. The encoding is too
restrictive. It even encodes line breaks.

&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.debug.core.source_locator_memento"
value="&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;
encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;#10;&amp;lt;sourceLookupDirector&amp;gt;&amp;#10;....

so, now I have a shared launch configuration but can't share it. Is there a way
to change this to avoid long lines?
John, do you have any insight on this, and what other SDK components do to 
live with this limitation?
This is my first exposure to this requirement (so I don't have any special 
insight)
Can the file just be marked binary, so that there are no "lines" in it to worry about?

When we've run into cases where know we need to store text containing line
separators or other directly user-influenced text, we use a child node instead
of an attribute value. Putting the text into a CDATA node and placing that
inside of a child element tends to save us from having to worry about escaping
any characters aside from the CDATA ending sequence, "]]&gt;".

&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.debug.core.source_locator_memento"
value="&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;
encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;#10;&amp;lt;sourceLookupDirector&amp;gt;&amp;#10;....


becomes:

&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.debug.core.source_locator_memento"&gt;
&lt;value&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;sourceLookupDirector&gt;
....
]]&gt;
&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/stringAttribute&gt;

Well, of course this is possible but then you'll loose all the nice merge 
features of ClearCase and, in our environment only _the_ admin can change a 
file type. Regulare users (developers) don't have the necessary permissions.
Nothing planned for 3.1

    <WithStack>This PR is a continuation of the bug #77812. The problem is that SWT 
intensively filters GDK events and then puts them back into OS. Patch suggested 
in the bug #77812 was not suitable due to Java event queue is not visible to 
GTK.

Patch proposed in this PR solves this problem using GTK idle source which is 
added to main context if Java has deferred GDK events.

I am going to attach the patch in the next post.

Native library which implements function from OS1 class.
Wow.  This fix is really complicated.  Dispatch the events from a higher 
priority idle handler.  This will take a long time to decode and understand 
all of the ramifications of this.

The question I have for you is, "Is the fix still necessary?".  Given that the 
queue now grows faster and Eclipse no longer causes deferred events to happen 
in the open editor benchmark.  Given that the idea actually works, the trade 
off here is the complexity of understanding and maintainability of the code.  
If GTK changes anything in this area, we are exposed.

My preference would be to keep this idea in our back pocket for now.
I checked this on scenario when 30 Java editors are opened at once. This fix is 
still necessary

Here are the reasons

1. Display.putGdkEvents() which takes 4% of total execution time is avoided
2. Display.eventProc() and Display.idleProc() are called only 3 200 times in 
comparison with current CVS where Display.eventProc() is called 51 000 times
3. Display.eventProc() and Display.idleProc() take only 12% of execution time 
in comparison with current CSV where Display.eventProc() takes 14% of execution 
time

So proposed solution is 6% faster than current. 

"the trade off here is the complexity of understanding and maintainability of 
the code"

Saying that words you can reject any idea which makes things slightly 
different. A lot of thing in GTK is done using contribution into main loop via 
idle handlers. Concept of main loop and recursive iterations is a base for GTK.

"If GTK changes anything in this area, we are exposed."

If GTK changes anything in ANY area, we are exposed. GTK has API and main loops 
and contexts are the part of GTK API. For example if GTK changes the way it 
stores widget in GDK window so gdk_window_get_user_data is not longer valid we 
will need to rewrite our code also. 

Code that keeps the events in the operating system queue is more likely to 
keep working than code that keeps them in a private queue and tries to feed 
them back to GTK at the right time in an idle handler.  It is exactly because 
GTK does so much work in the idle handlers that I am afraid of this.

There is a big difference between GTK changing gdk_window_get_user_data() and 
causing us to fail and GTK changing the way events are dispatched, the idle 
handling etc.  In the former case, we will GP.  GTK is unlikely to make this 
change but, it they do we are dead.  However, GTK is lible to play with any of 
the code that implements the event loop and idle handling, to fix a bug or 
optimize it etc.  In this case, we are likely to break in subtle ways and not 
know why.

Given that the performance improvement is only 6% (an improvement by the way 
that we would take if the approach were less dangerous), the thinking right 
now is not to attempt this fix.

Other than opening the 30 editors (a case that Eclipse is supposed to have 
fixed), is there another place where this pattern occurs?
I think this affects any code which waits for clipboard content
I'm sorry but the changes are too dangerous.  We WONTFIX this.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>There is a bug in ThumbnailUpdater.
It occurs when the source figure is moving.
in Thumbnail.ThumbnailUpdater.start() the thumbnailGraphics is translated:
		thumbnailGraphics.translate(sourceFigure.getBounds().getLocation().negate());

There is silently assumed that source figure is not moving.
But is the source figure is moving and ThumbnailUpdater is running, the method
run() again asks for a source figure location:
org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Point p = sourceFigure.getBounds().getLocation();
and this can be different.

I recommend to delete a line that translates thumbnailGraphics in the method
start() and add it into a method run().
I will attach an example where we can see the effect of this bug and also my
proposal - code change.

BrokenThumbnailExample

I took the code from the provided demo and patched it into the ThumbNailExample in draw2d examples. I can confirm that the text is missing from the thumbnail. Interesting that if we add 5 sets of figures (i = 5) the text appears in the thumbnail. Other values (i = 10) cause the text to not be in the thumbnail.

The provided patch does not fix the issue, so I have obsoleted it.

    <WithStack>If you go to the preference page for the code formatter and then resize it so
that you can better see the preview of the formatted code, both the left and
right portions of the formatter page consume horizontal space. The left side
should NOT be set to grab excess horizontal space but instead the preview pane
should grab all of that space.
Not so easy. This is managed by the SashForm, and to reimplement that is not
trivial. The advantage of the current solution is that it is helpful when the
left side uses a bigger font and is not fully visible.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>the "Align fields in columns" property in the code formatter indents the body of
an anonymous inner class. I think there should be a seperate setting for
anonymous classes in fields which would allow the body to be aligned with the
start of the field declarations eg
class A
{
   SomeClass fField     = new SomeClass()
   {
     //class body
   };
}
Not sure if we will do this. Time permitting only.
Deferring post 3.1
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

-Team/Show in Resource History
-Resource History view opens and shows no history for the file.

Same actions in Version: 3.0.0 Build id: 200403261517 result in the correct

This works for me in the latest integration build and I don't remember any 
changes between 3.0 and 3.0.1 in this area. What server version are you using? 
Is there anything in the error log? If not, can you follow the steps at this 
URL to get a trace of what the sever is sending?:

That is an unsupported version of CVSNT. However, it will still work for the 
most part. You need to make sure that the case you use for your repository 
path matches that which the server returns. You used "d:\..." where the server 
returns "D:\..." so you'll need to create your repository path using a 
capital "D". Eclipse doesn't differentiate between CVSNT and the cvshome.org 
CVS and assumes that paths are case sensitive. CVSNT is communicating with 
Eclipse with the assumption that paths (or at least drive letters) are not 
case sensitive.

Check this link for more details on server compatibility issues.

That is an unsupported version of CVSNT. However, it will still work for the 
most part. You need to make sure that the case you use for your repository 
path matches that which the server returns. You used "d:\..." where the server 
returns "D:\..." so you'll need to create your repository path using a 
capital "D". Eclipse doesn't differentiate between CVSNT and the cvshome.org 
CVS and assumes that paths are case sensitive. CVSNT is communicating with 
Eclipse with the assumption that paths (or at least drive letters) are not 
case sensitive.

    <WithStack>CDT Version: 2.1 RC3 (but occurs with any RC or build that supports function
folding)
Eclipse Version: 3.1 M2

The following code Examples are from an fully working program, that creates just
a small window:

  // the Window Procedure
  LRESULT CALLBACK WndPro(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
  {
      switch(msg)
      {
          case WM_CLOSE:
              DestroyWindow(hwnd);
          break;
          case WM_DESTROY:
              PostQuitMessage(0);
          break;
          default:
              return DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);
      }
      return 0;
  }


  // dialog procedure
  BOOL CALLBACK DialogProc(HWND hWnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
  {
      switch(uMsg)
      {
          case WM_CLOSE:
              EndDialog(hWnd, 0);
          break;
                  
          default:
          	return FALSE;
    	  
      } 
      return TRUE;
  }

The Function folding dows not work for both functions. If I delete 'CALLBACK' in
the Function head then the function folding works; if I change BOOL in bool then
the function folding works also. But with any of this changes, the program
becomes corrupt.

Daniel
The underlying problem is the parse mode used to generate the outline.

    <WithStack>The outline view does not get updated correctly after refactoring(renaming) a 
member variable.

I refactored a member variable fields into fieldPanel. After refactoring the 
outline view show both the member variable with the old name (fields) and with 
the new name (fieldPanel) see the screenshot. 

My Configuration:
=================
VE Version: 1.0.1.1
Build Id: 200410221351

Eclipse Version: 3.1.0
Build Id: 200408122000

EMF Version: 2.1.0
Build Id: 200410141127
Created attachment 16162
Screenshot of the outline update bug
If the visual editor is reopend for the file the outline view gets updated 
correctly.
That is actually a JDT problem. That isn't our view. Though it could be the way
we are doing the change. 

Since you are at 3.1 it may be a  problem that was just added with them. It
works for us at 3.0.x. Could you try something please? Bring up your class with
the straight java editor, not the VE. Then from the text editor, select the
field, do ctrl+1, then select "rename in file" and rename the field. See if the
outline view is now bad. That is basically what we use under the covers.
This works in VE 1.1

There are many reasons why warnings are are designated.  Are you sure that you
do not have other (than import) warnings

Check the right hand side annotation bar for a yellow marking, click on it; it
will drive you to where the warning is coming from.

Warning are driven from Perf-&gt;Java-&gt;Compiler
Closing since there is no info. If you still have the problem with VE 1.1 please

    <WithStack>For some reason fiji is reporting this error:

For one, we should see how to configure fiji such that it doesn't give this 
error. Also, it does not affect the operation so we need to handle it more 
gracefully. We used to only fail when the command returned error but we seem 
to be failing now in more cases.
Fixed in HEAD and server configured properly.</WithStack>

				setDirty(true);
				repaint();
				return;
			}
			current = current.getParent();
		}
	}
}

The repaint() method causes the UpdateManager to add a dirty region:

(class Figure)
public void repaint(int x, int y, int w, int h) {
	if (isVisible())
		getUpdateManager().addDirtyRegion(this, x, y, w, h);
}

And now we come to a point where the implementation of DeferredUpdateManager is
important:

(a piece of code from a class DeferredUpdateManager)
protected void repairDamage() {

	...

	if (!dirtyRegions.isEmpty()) {
		firePainting(damage, dirtyRegions);
		dirtyRegions.clear();
	}

	...	
}

We can see that the code flow is as follows:

0. something changed in the thumbnail's source figure
1. repairDamage is called (DeferredUpdateManager)
2. firePainting is called (DeferredUpdateManager)
	2.1. notifyPainting is called (Thumbnail)
	2.2. repaint is called (Figure)
	2.3. addDirtyRegion is called (DeferredUpdateManager) - this add an item in
dirtyRegiods field
6. a statement dirtyRegions.clear() is executed

We can see that even if the thumbnail asks for repainting, the information is
lost, because dirtyRegions field
is cleared.

The path proposal will be in the following bugzilla comment.
My proposal is to replace a piece of code:

(a piece of code from a class DeferredUpdateManager)

A patch
The problem does not occur when a source figure and a thumbnail use different
UpdateManagers, which is the case of Logic example.
However, when a thumbnail is inside an editor, the source figure and the
thumbnail share an update manager and the problem occurs.
Hi again.
I just looked into a HEAD of CVS and I can think of a better solution:

protected void repairDamage() {

	...

	if (!dirtyRegions.isEmpty()) {
		Map backup = dirtyRegions;
		dirtyRegions = new HashMap();
		firePainting(damage, backup);
	}

	...	
}
Thumbnail is intended to be used in a separate LightweightSystem from the 
source figure.  Are you using it in this way?
I am using it in the same LightweightSystem.

(My editor consists of three columns, each has its own small thumbnail used for
scrolling the column.)
Fixed as follows:

if (!dirtyRegions.isEmpty()) {
	Map oldRegions = dirtyRegions;		
	dirtyRegions = new HashMap();
	firePainting(damage, oldRegions);
}

Of course, you now have the problem that you thumbnail will infinitely repaint
over and over because it sees itself painting and decides to repaint.
Randy, make sure you add Milos Volauf as a contributor to the copyright.
This is an obvious programming fix in this case. I wrote comment 7 without 
having seen comment 4. We do the same thing in lots of other places.
&gt; Of course, you now have the problem that you thumbnail will infinitely 
repaint 
&gt; over and over because it sees itself painting and decides to repaint. 
 
The thumbnail repaints itself only if a source figure is repainted. 
So if the thumbnail is not a child of the source figure, it is not 
infinitely repainted over and over. See a method Thumbnail.notifyPainting(). 
Great. I hope it works. I guess that's why we went through the trouble of 
passing around the Map of dirty regions.

    <WithOutStack>The problem is as follows:

Thumbnail is listening (via UpdateListener) an UpdateManager and handles
notifyPainting event. If the thumbnail's source figure is about to be painted,
the thumbnail asks for repainting:

(class Thumbnail)
public void notifyPainting(Rectangle damage, Map dirtyRegions) {
	Iterator dirtyFigures = dirtyRegions.keySet().iterator();
	while (dirtyFigures.hasNext()) {
		IFigure current = (IFigure)dirtyFigures.next();
		while (current != null) {

				setDirty(true);
				repaint();
				return;

    <WithStack>The eclipse website provides several forum archives [mailinglists, newsgroups].

It is a common practice within open-source projects, to have those archives open
to the public (without the need of a registration). 

This simplifies referencing, collaboration, archival within search-engines [thus
content appears as search reslut e.g. within google] etc.

Please remove the read-access password-protection to the archives and
html-nntp-forums (which serve as an archive, too) on eclipse.org.

-

Example for the eclipse forum archives:

html-forum archive, which has a convenient threaded view:
http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=32944&amp;group=eclipse.platform

same message within the mailing-list-style archive:
http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg32969.html

Both are not accessible without registration.
The reason behind the password protection is to prevent spambots from retrieving
the e-mail address of the poster.  

This tool:
http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg32969.html

conceals the identity fo the poster in an acceptable fashion, but do we really
want to hide that information?  As it is, the information is open and public to
whomever wants to access it.


I agree with the web master.  I have used my real e-mail address, under 
assumption the groups are password protected.
We cannot change the rules down the road.  Otherwise I would request all my 
post to be deleted.
Please have the gentleness to not "RESOLVE WONTFIX" reports thus early.

I'll comment on the comments to a later point.

Thank you
I am closing this issue, and I will be advising the EMO via the
eclipse.foundation newsgroup.  The same userid/password is required to read the
newsgroups, post articles and read the archives, and has been so for a long
time.  The entire community has come to know this procedure and to rely on it to
protect themselves from unwanted spam.
Once more I ask you friendly, to not "RESOLVE WONTFIX" this Issue as to leave it
open [as it is], thus it can be discussed, researched, voted etc.

I've no problem to discuss it partly within the newsgroup - but this is my
personal decision.

I'll give further comments soon.

[note to readers: see the Bugzilla field "URL" above for a link to the relevant
news-thread].
-1,  
 
As Konrad mentions in Comment #2, many uses their corporate email when posting 
on those groups relying on the fact that they are password protected (which 
stops most automatic systems to harvest email addresses for spam). 
 
It also stops the normal newsgroup spam that many other newsgroups ends up 
having if one can post anonymously. 
 
 
I agree with ilias, this bug should remain open. Having password protected
mailing list and newgroup archives deters casual users / developers that want to
participate. There are ways to obfuscate email addresses so that spam harvesters
will not be able find any email addresses. This is very much an infrastructural
problem with eclipse.org. 

The folks at gmane.org have a good setup that you might want to investigate
(read the Encryption section):

http://www.gmane.org/tmda.php

Maybe eclipse.org should just use gmane rather than try to maintain your own
archives.
Comment 6:
"It also stops the normal newsgroup spam that many other newsgroups ends up 
having if one can post anonymously. "

this is valid, but off-context 
[I don't ask to remove write-access password-protection]

-

Comment 7:
*exclusive* external archival on gmane

eclipse should maintain own archives, to allow full in-site-operation.

an *additional* external archive is of course worthfull.
[but gmane has several problems]

I'll shortly post the summary.
ilias, I intended the comment about gmane to be a suggestion. I personally find
the mail to nttp gateway ideas to be very handy and I use it for all of my list
viewing except for lists on eclipse.org. I'm looking forward to seeing the list
of problems. 

“Eclipse Webmaster”,  I emailed webmaster@eclispe.org on September 1, 2004
asking for this feature. Mike Milinkovich (Executive Director, Eclipse
Foundation) responded and indicated that part of the problem was that email
addresses within messages were not concealed. An example of this can be seen in
this message:

http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-swt-dev/msg03792.html

Once again, I have to say this is an infrastructural problem with eclipse.org.
Red Hat's mailing list archiving software seems to be able to handle this type
of situation. This message shows an example:

http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-November/msg09099.html

Mike also mentioned that this issue would be looked into after the eclipse
website was moved. IIRC, this happened a few weeks ago.

BTW, it would be nice if you used your real name so we know who we are talking to.
Comment 9:
Please do not increase complexity whilst interweaving issues.

This Issue is about "enable open read-access to eclipse internal forum
archives", and affects mailinglists and newsgroups.

gmane is an external archive - and operates only on mailinglists.

I suggest you to proceed in two steps (file an Issue):
  a) "Archive eclipse mailinglists additionally on gmane.org" [read-only-nntp-acess]

After the read-access is done:
  b) "Provide write-access to eclipse mailinglists via gmane.org"

[Let me know if you need assistance or if I should file the issues for you. ]

I will comment then within the new issues.

-

"BTW, it would be nice if you used your real name so we know who we are talking to."
"ilias" is my real name.
In conjunction with my email adress, you have all information that I like to
provide you.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=79556#c10
"ilias" is my real name."

I am certain he was refering to "Webmaster."

Bugzilla does expose the mail addresses I believe.  How was this concern avoided
there?
Comment 11.
You are right, he's refering to the WebMaster's real name.
My apology, I've overseen this.

[Bugzilla: no special action is taken, emails are exposed, which is natural.]

I'll post shorty a preliminary Summary.

SPAMCONTROL:

http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/resources/spammode.html 
This bug is a little hard to follow, but I would like to try to revive it.  It
is currently very awkward to refer to newsgroup and mailing list posts because
of the password protection.  Specifically, this comes up when dealing with
developers on IRC, developers from other projects, or with people who have
bugzilla accounts but may not wish to register for a newsgroup password.

Since pretty much every other open source project I have ever been involved with
has open mailing list archives, it would be very nice to see this on eclipse.org
as well.  Obfuscating email addresses of web-accessible archives is common
practice, and many software tools seem to handle this job nicely.
The bug is definitely not dead, and I too want to remove the password
protection. I will get around to it, it's just a matter of time.

Right now migrating the Eclipse infrastructure to the new hardware is proving to
be a formidable task.
While migrating eclipse.org to the new hardware infrastructure, I have started
to ensure that e-mail addresses are obfuscated throughout our applications so
that, if need be, we can remove passworded access to web-based resources such as
the mailing list archives and the web-based newsgroup portal (passwords would
remain on the newsgroups themselves).

For instance, if you use the latest NewsPortal on Eclipse, I have removed mail
links and have replaced domain names with x's :
http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/thread.php?group=eclipse.newcomer
http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=1219&amp;group=eclipse.newcomer#1219

Denis
+1 for removing the password protection :)
I'd like to suggest removing the password protection from the following resource:

- Web access to newsgroup archives

The sender's e-mail address in this resource are mangled.  However, if the
message itself contains e-mail addresses, they are left open.



The following resources should be kept password-protected, and for the reasons
listed:

- newsreader (outlook, thunderbird, etc) access to the newsgroups (news server
does not mangle e-mail addresses)

- WebPortal access to the newsgroups (to have a consistent rule with the
newsreader access ... Wanna post to an eclipse newsgroup? get a password)

- web access to mailing list archives (although the sender's e-mail address is
mangled, several e-mail addresses in the messages are not mangled as a result of
replying to an e-mail)


This is a pretty high-impact item, and I'd like your feedback. I believe having
our newsgroup archives indexed by search engines would be a definite plus, and
could offer some encouragement to the community to post questions and answers in
the groups rather than in the mailing lists.

Thanks
Mangling email addresses, even those in the body of the message, does not seem
to be a problem for GNU mailman.  See the user's signature in this post, for
example:

http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2004-October/msg00159.html

It would be really great to have these archives more easily accessable (the
releng list in particular is one I reference alot, but cannot provide links to).
(In reply to comment #19)
&gt; Mangling email addresses, even those in the body of the message, does not seem
&gt; to be a problem for GNU mailman.  See the user's signature in this post, for
&gt; example:

Actually, they're using MHonArc 2.6.10, the same version I recently upgraded
eclipse.org to.  Looking at this archive, generated yesterday, it seems this is
specific to the new version of MHonArc, because e-mail addresses in our own
archives are also mangled:

http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/eclipse-dev/msg07014.html

I would probably just have to regenerate the archives for all the lists at some
point.

But if we start with removing passwords from newsgroups, that would be a step in
the right direction, right?
yes :)

BTW, how does Google Groups handles newsgroups?
I'm in the process of regenerating the mailing list archives and the newsgroup
archives. The newer version of MHonARC we're using supports mangling e-mail
addresses in the body of the messages, but archived messages need to be
re-created for this. 

Once the archives are re-created, I'll switch the links to the new archives and
remove the password protection from both archives, allowing Google and others to
index that content while preserving your SPAM protection.

This will be a definite win for the entire community.

Any comments or questions are by all means welcome.
(In reply to comment #22)
&gt; Once the archives are re-created, I'll switch the links to the new archives and
&gt; remove the password protection from both archives, allowing Google and others to
&gt; index that content while preserving your SPAM protection.

Awesome!  Thanks for doing this.


It's done. Passwords have been removed from the mailing list archives and the
news archives. No more exquisitus. To ensure your e-mail addresses were
protected, even the ones embedded in the message text, I needed to regenerate
all the archives. As a result, some message numbers have changed, so some links
will be broken (or won't point to the right posting). But it's for a better
cause, right?

It's only a matter of time before search engines start picking up all this new
content.
Denis, thanks very much!
In comment #18 you mentioned passwords would not be removed from:
- newsreader (outlook, thunderbird, etc) access to the newsgroups
- WebPortal access to the newsgroups
- web access to mailing list archives

It sounds like you removed passwords from the last one which was ok because of
mangling. How about the first two?

http://www.gmane.org/tmda.php

Maybe eclipse.org should just use gmane rather than try to maintain your own
archives.
Comment 6:
"It also stops the normal newsgroup spam that many other newsgroups ends up 
having if one can post anonymously. "

this is valid, but off-context 
[I don't ask to remove write-access password-protection]

-

Comment 7:
*exclusive* external archival on gmane

eclipse should maintain own archives, to allow full in-site-operation.

an *additional* external archive is of course worthfull.
[but gmane has several problems]

I'll shortly post the summary.
ilias, I intended the comment about gmane to be a suggestion. I personally find
the mail to nttp gateway ideas to be very handy and I use it for all of my list
viewing except for lists on eclipse.org. I'm looking forward to seeing the list
of problems. 

“Eclipse Webmaster”,  I emailed webmaster@eclispe.org on September 1, 2004
asking for this feature. Mike Milinkovich (Executive Director, Eclipse
Foundation) responded and indicated that part of the problem was that email
addresses within messages were not concealed. An example of this can be seen in
this message:

http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-swt-dev/msg03792.html

Once again, I have to say this is an infrastructural problem with eclipse.org.
Red Hat's mailing list archiving software seems to be able to handle this type
of situation. This message shows an example:

http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-November/msg09099.html

Mike also mentioned that this issue would be looked into after the eclipse
website was moved. IIRC, this happened a few weeks ago.

BTW, it would be nice if you used your real name so we know who we are talking to.
Comment 9:
Please do not increase complexity whilst interweaving issues.

This Issue is about "enable open read-access to eclipse internal forum
archives", and affects mailinglists and newsgroups.

gmane is an external archive - and operates only on mailinglists.

I suggest you to proceed in two steps (file an Issue):
  a) "Archive eclipse mailinglists additionally on gmane.org" [read-only-nntp-acess]

After the read-access is done:
  b) "Provide write-access to eclipse mailinglists via gmane.org"

[Let me know if you need assistance or if I should file the issues for you. ]

I will comment then within the new issues.

-

"BTW, it would be nice if you used your real name so we know who we are talking to."
"ilias" is my real name.
In conjunction with my email adress, you have all information that I like to
provide you.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=79556#c10
"ilias" is my real name."

I am certain he was refering to "Webmaster."

Bugzilla does expose the mail addresses I believe.  How was this concern avoided
there?
Comment 11.
You are right, he's refering to the WebMaster's real name.
My apology, I've overseen this.

[Bugzilla: no special action is taken, emails are exposed, which is natural.]

I'll post shorty a preliminary Summary.

Newsgroup html-gateway "newsportal", used as archive:

Mailinglist / Newsgroup archive

uses: MHonArc 2.5.0

a newer version is available:

http://www.mhonarc.org

SPAMCONTROL:

http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/resources/spammode.html 
This bug is a little hard to follow, but I would like to try to revive it.  It
is currently very awkward to refer to newsgroup and mailing list posts because
of the password protection.  Specifically, this comes up when dealing with
developers on IRC, developers from other projects, or with people who have
bugzilla accounts but may not wish to register for a newsgroup password.

Since pretty much every other open source project I have ever been involved with
has open mailing list archives, it would be very nice to see this on eclipse.org
as well.  Obfuscating email addresses of web-accessible archives is common
practice, and many software tools seem to handle this job nicely.
The bug is definitely not dead, and I too want to remove the password
protection. I will get around to it, it's just a matter of time.

Right now migrating the Eclipse infrastructure to the new hardware is proving to
be a formidable task.
While migrating eclipse.org to the new hardware infrastructure, I have started
to ensure that e-mail addresses are obfuscated throughout our applications so
that, if need be, we can remove passworded access to web-based resources such as
the mailing list archives and the web-based newsgroup portal (passwords would
remain on the newsgroups themselves).

For instance, if you use the latest NewsPortal on Eclipse, I have removed mail
links and have replaced domain names with x's :
http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/thread.php?group=eclipse.newcomer
http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=1219&amp;group=eclipse.newcomer#1219

Denis
+1 for removing the password protection :)
I'd like to suggest removing the password protection from the following resource:

- Web access to newsgroup archives

The sender's e-mail address in this resource are mangled.  However, if the
message itself contains e-mail addresses, they are left open.



The following resources should be kept password-protected, and for the reasons
listed:

- newsreader (outlook, thunderbird, etc) access to the newsgroups (news server
does not mangle e-mail addresses)

- WebPortal access to the newsgroups (to have a consistent rule with the
newsreader access ... Wanna post to an eclipse newsgroup? get a password)

- web access to mailing list archives (although the sender's e-mail address is
mangled, several e-mail addresses in the messages are not mangled as a result of
replying to an e-mail)


This is a pretty high-impact item, and I'd like your feedback. I believe having
our newsgroup archives indexed by search engines would be a definite plus, and
could offer some encouragement to the community to post questions and answers in
the groups rather than in the mailing lists.

Thanks
Mangling email addresses, even those in the body of the message, does not seem
to be a problem for GNU mailman.  See the user's signature in this post, for
example:

http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2004-October/msg00159.html

It would be really great to have these archives more easily accessable (the
releng list in particular is one I reference alot, but cannot provide links to).
(In reply to comment #19)
&gt; Mangling email addresses, even those in the body of the message, does not seem
&gt; to be a problem for GNU mailman.  See the user's signature in this post, for
&gt; example:

Actually, they're using MHonArc 2.6.10, the same version I recently upgraded
eclipse.org to.  Looking at this archive, generated yesterday, it seems this is
specific to the new version of MHonArc, because e-mail addresses in our own
archives are also mangled:

http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/eclipse-dev/msg07014.html

I would probably just have to regenerate the archives for all the lists at some
point.

But if we start with removing passwords from newsgroups, that would be a step in
the right direction, right?
yes :)

BTW, how does Google Groups handles newsgroups?
I'm in the process of regenerating the mailing list archives and the newsgroup
archives. The newer version of MHonARC we're using supports mangling e-mail
addresses in the body of the messages, but archived messages need to be
re-created for this. 

Once the archives are re-created, I'll switch the links to the new archives and
remove the password protection from both archives, allowing Google and others to
index that content while preserving your SPAM protection.

This will be a definite win for the entire community.

Any comments or questions are by all means welcome.

Awesome!  Thanks for doing this.


It's done. Passwords have been removed from the mailing list archives and the
news archives. No more exquisitus. To ensure your e-mail addresses were
protected, even the ones embedded in the message text, I needed to regenerate
all the archives. As a result, some message numbers have changed, so some links
will be broken (or won't point to the right posting). But it's for a better
cause, right?

It's only a matter of time before search engines start picking up all this new
content.
Denis, thanks very much!
In comment #18 you mentioned passwords would not be removed from:
- newsreader (outlook, thunderbird, etc) access to the newsgroups
- WebPortal access to the newsgroups
- web access to mailing list archives

It sounds like you removed passwords from the last one which was ok because of
mangling. How about the first two?

If I remove the password protection from the news server (outlook, thunderbird)
itself I'd be 
a) allowing posts from anyone
b) allow anyone to scan posts and extract e-mails

If I remove the password protection from the news portal I'd be
a) allowing posts from anyone

Unauthenticated posting sounds like a bad idea to me. Case in point: e-mail.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Display.getShells() and Disply.getActiveShell() methods are called in eclipse 
very frequently. For example during opening of 40 Java editors Display.getShells
() was called about 12 000 times and this method took 2.2% of total scenario 
execution time.

This is due to widgetTable, which contains hundreds of widgets, is scanned each 
time. However amount of non-disposed shells is about 2-4 depending on amount of 
opened dialogs. So it is better to keep separate array of non-disposed shells 
rather than scan throw widgetTable.

In next post I am going to attach this patch.

Display &amp; Shell patch
Newer version of GTK have API to query the active shell.  FH to investigate to 
see whether we can reduce the number of calls to getShells().
There is no OS call to obtain the active Shell, the call you were thinking of is
gtk_window_list_toplevel ().  This call returns every top level window on GTK
and it is slower than going through the list in Java.

I have optimized getActiveShell() not to call getShells().  We don't really want
to make a special case of Shells in the widget table.  Artyom, can you rerun
your benchmark?  Specifically, why is getShells() called so many times from Eclipse?
New version of Display.getActiveShell() is 4.5 times faster. Thanks for fixing 
this.

While we are here could you please also change Display.getShells() method 
something like this.

public Shell [] getShells () {
  checkDevice ();
  final int shellGrow = 10; 
  Shell []shells = new Shell[shellGrow];
  int length = 0;

  main:
  for (int i=0; i&lt;widgetTable.length; i++) {
    Widget widget = widgetTable [i];
    if (widget != null &amp;&amp; widget instanceof Shell) {
      for(int j=0; j&lt;length; j++)
        if(widget == shells[j]) continue main;
      if(length == shells.length) {
        Shell [] new_shells = new Shell[length + shellGrow];
        System.arraycopy(shells,0,new_shells,0,length);
        shells = new_shells;
      }
      shells[length++] = (Shell)widget;
    }
  }

  if (length == shells.length) return shells;
  Shell [] result = new Shell [length];
  System.arraycopy (shells, 0, result, 0, length);
  return result;
}

This version works 1.5 times faster.
Is getShells() still a problem?  If not, then we should simply close the bug 
report.  It seems that the real problem was getActiveShell() and this had been 
fixed.  FH?
I repeated the test, but before I opened and closed the editors so java files 
content is cached in the Eclipse. The results for old Display code were:

1. Display.getShells() is called 3 300 times not from Display.getActiveShell() 
and takes 1% of total execution time
2. Display.getActiveShell() is called 8 700 times and takes 2 % of execution 
time

Disply.getActiveShell() is fixed now, but Disply.getShells() can also be 
slightly improved.
Where is getShells() called from?
It was called from BusyIndicator.showWhile() and ApplicationWindow.run(). Most 
of the calls were from BusyIndicator.showWhile(). 
Fixed in HEAD  &gt; 20041201

Artyom, try to observe SWT code pattern and use it when you submit a patch.
We try to avoid 'continue', specially when it involves labels. See how I changed
your code before releasing it.

Thanks.

Code that "continues to labels" had better be super optimal or it will be 
rejected out of hand because it is inconsistent with the coding style used by 
the rest of SWT.
Thanks for fixing this. I will not use "continues to labels" in future patches.

Since WorkingSetModel seems to be the only place where an IWorkingSet is created
with said Id, this is probably safe, as long as there is just one
WorkingSetModel. (Lemma 1)

- In the 1-arg-ctor restoring from an IMemento, restoreState is called on the
local working set manager, triggering the same
AbstractWorkingSetManager.internalAddWorkingSet call that results in said
property change event.

PackageExplorerPart seems to manage the singleton instance of WorkingSetModel,
which ensures that never two Models exist at the same time. (Lemma 2)

with said Id, this is probably safe, as long as there is just one
WorkingSetModel. (Lemma 1)

- In the 1-arg-ctor restoring from an IMemento, restoreState is called on the
local working set manager, triggering the same
AbstractWorkingSetManager.internalAddWorkingSet call that results in said
property change event.

PackageExplorerPart seems to manage the singleton instance of WorkingSetModel,
which ensures that never two Models exist at the same time. (Lemma 2)

-&gt; Given 1 &amp; 2, I believe this is fixed :-)</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>hi,
you should provide a public method for starting the rerun action from the api
instead of using InternalSearchUI.getInstance().runAgain(iSearchQuery);!
will have a look.
I added NewSearchUI.cancelQuery and fixed runQueryInBack/ForeGround to allow
running the same query twice.

That means you can now easely reimplement the rerun action yourself

Please open a related feature (if not already opened) for the import wizard
(also GLA) to allow the user to specify a time zone (whith default the local
time zone) for logs that doesn't contain time zone info.
Changing to P1 as per the 4.1 official plan.
The implementation of the first part of the feature (as in description) contains
a exra 'display time zone' field in preference page to let user select a display
time zone and given user selection, log(CBE) related views will be using the
time zone for displayed.

second part as requested by Marius in comment #2 is independent of the original
feature. it's more link to feature bug 74918, where timezone support in GLA and
support by logParser extension pt. (feature bug 50681). user will be selecting
timezone in wizard and be passed to GLA when generating CBEs.

    <WithStack>Hello,

I'm currently using 3.1m3 and am curious 
on why the following code builds fine within the IDE ( making sure the 
project is using the 1.5 ( 5 ) compiler ), but does NOT build fine when 
using the 1.5 javac.exe. Here's the code:

A.java
=====
public class A
{
}

B.java
=====
public class B extends A
{
}

C.java
======
import java.util.List;
public interface C
{
    List&lt; A &gt; getIt();
}

D.java
======
import java.util.List;
public interface D extends C
{
    List&lt; B &gt; getIt();
}

When building these files from the command line, I get the following error:

******************************************************************
F:\temp&gt;javac *.java
D.java:4: getIt() in D clashes with getIt() in C; attempting to use 
incompatible return type
found   : java.util.List&lt;B&gt;
required: java.util.List&lt;A&gt;
   List&lt; B &gt; getIt();
             ^
1 error
*******************************************************************

But when I build those same files in the Eclipse 3.1m3 IDE, builds fine. I 
believe this code should NOT build. In order to make it build from the 
command line, I have to change C.java so that the getIt() method's return 
type looks like this:

List&lt; ? extends A &gt;

Regards,

Cameron
The "why" is simple: Eclipse defines its own Java compiler.

Now you may have found a bug...

    <WithStack>Users of the RAC/agent communication layer have complained that there is no

This is targeted for new agent controller.
Here are some clarification on this request with Dave Smith:

- this tries to aid the debugging on the agent side 
(mainly named pipe but shared memory would be a nice addition).

- because the AC will support multiple instances on the same system,
  the environment variable may not work well. 
  The suggestion is to make it configurable in the AC configuration file:
     AGENT_COMM_TRACE = YES/NO
     AGENT_COMM_TRACE_FILE = trace.log

  In the future, if we need dynamic configuration, this could be converted
  in to an AC command at run time.

  The single log will contain traces for all agents (with proper agent id tags)

- The main communication activities that are need to be logged
  are in "RABindings.c" and "hcbnd.c"

Here is the summary of the effort:

Sizing: 

- two weeks to write up the design, review and approve by the community
  (especially what type of and how much info should be traced,
   and the format of the trace records, probably using CBE)
   . The design will appy for any transport layer (e.g. socket is included)

- one week of coding and testing

From defect #80013:

The new org.eclipse.hyades.logging.native native Common Base Event 
implementation should be used to reinstrument the existing log message in the 
Data Collection Engine for 
increased PD capabilities (e.g. viewing, filtering, sorting, analysis, 
correlation).  This includes:

-Port the existing instrumented log messages (e.g. ra_logServiceMessage()) to 
log native Common Base Events including a situation and source component ID.

-Instrument new log messages for all types of situations:

-Start
-Stop
-Connect

See fix for defect https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=79657 for an 
illustrative example of Common Base Event logging in C/++.
The basic logging support is in place for the Agent Controller and agents.  I 
still need to look into the code and make sure the logging service is actually 
being called at the appropriate places.

A few other loose ends need to be tied up, such as logging from shared 
libraries, client logging, and filtering based on a configured log level.
The logging framework has been put in place for the new Agent Controller.  I

libraries, client logging, and filtering based on a configured log level.
The logging framework has been put in place for the new Agent Controller.  I 
have opened new bugzilla reports to capture the remaining effort to round this 
out more fully.  These new items are: 111943, 111946 and 111947
As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant enhancements/defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed. If this enhancement/defect is still unresolved and reproducible in the latest TPTP release (http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/), please re-open.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Allow filtering at the sensor and extractor level of the GLA
 to improve GLA performance.
Will provide more details soon.
need to think more on this and break it down into a set of requirements based 
on a use case.
Theme: Scaling Up

By reducing the amount of data that is parsed by the Parser component using 
regular expression parsing, the overall performance of GLA will be improved.

Further Description of Requirement:

The requirement is to allow the sensor or extractor to filter out lines or data 
that are not of interest, based on rules specified by the adapter writers 
and/or users.  More details of the use cases is required to size this 
feature.   
This new feature needs to be added to the documentation.

New messages will likely be required.

The GLA Editor will need to be regenerarted with new fields added to the GLA 
schema.
Candidate for 4.2
After reviewing the design, here are my comments in upper case:
Use-case 1 (static, parser writer filtering)
... It is REQUIRED that the OSSingleFileSensor AND ANY OTHER GLA SENSORS/EXTRACTORS FROM TPTP currently included with TPTP GLA be changed to support regex filter specification as part of this feature. 
If both the filter specification and filter exit class is specified in the adapter, then the filter specification is passed to the filter exit class which then tests the log line based on the filter specification.

1. Open two workbenches running at the same time.
2. Attach to an agent in one of the workbenches.
3. Go to the attach wizard in the other workbench, the agent shows up, but 
should not.

The agent does not show up if we go to the attach wizard in the same workbench 
where we attached to the agent.

I also tested this with an older Hyades driver (20040830_2107).  I saw the same 
issue.

----

This is causing crashing in higher products when two users attempt to monitor 
the same agent. This is a must-fix.
Please do not target these defects.  Defects are targeted as part of a approval
process.  Once the committers have agreed this is a must fix for 3.0.2 before it
be targeted.  Otherwise, its runs the risk of slipping under the radar and

Fix is to be done by the UI team va bug 79214. The isAttach(boolean) method is 
already implemented in the 3.0.2 stream.

    <WithStack>Importing a 1.2 project into 2.1 when there are libraries and library search 
paths fails because of an ID element that was not accounted for.
Fixed in 2.1 and head. Retargetting to 2.0.3 because it has a different 
converter, so we need to track the bug until it can be checked/translated to 
that stream.
Added a boundary condition test to handle the slightly odd 1.2 option ID 
format for these linker options. The converter now does the right thing in 
2.0.X, 2.1, and HEAD.
Failed in CDT 2.0.3 build 200502022231

The fix work for Libraries.  

But, it fails for Library Search Paths
As per Mathieu's comments this is still failing for part of the defect.  I will
re-open the defect.
Leo,  I hope that you don't mind that I assigned this to you :-)
Mathieu, how important is this defect?
I don't think it is very important.   P3

If you have a Library Search Path in a 1.2.x CDT project, it will disappear 
when it will be upgraded to a CDT 2.0.x project.
It doesn't look like this is too important.   It only affects people migrating
from 1.2 and they can manually re-add the path.  I am marking this as WONTFIX. 
If someone needs this, feel free to re-open the defect.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Build I200411240800 + HEAD of text + jdt ui projects

After converting our extensions for the command extension point according to 
the deprecation warnings there are some key bindings that do not work any 
longer. Note, the conversion might also be an coincidence but is the only 
obvious change in the area.

Although the following actions have key binding definitions in the XML, they 
do not show up on the key bindings perference page any longer. They also don't 
work.
- insert line above current line (org.eclipse.ui.edit.text.smartEnterInverse)
- insert line below current line (org.eclipse.ui.edit.text.smartEnter)

The following two actions used to work without explicit key binding 
definitions, but don't do so any longer:
- go to previous word (org.eclipse.ui.edit.text.goto.wordPrevious)
- go to next word (org.eclipse.ui.edit.text.goto.wordNext)

In both cases, adding the key bindings explicitly using the preference page 
brings them back to life.
"Ctrl+CR" and "Ctrl+Shift+CR" will work a bit better than "Ctrl+ENTER" and 
"Ctrl+Shift+ENTER".  Also, you might want to consider "M1+CR" and "M1+M2+CR".  
This is equivalent to saying "Command+CR" and "Command+Shift+CR" on MacOS X, 
and "Ctrl+CR" and "Ctrl+Shift+CR" on every other platform. 
 
Could you be more precise about the "wordPrevious" and "wordNext" problem?  In 
both the previous revision and the current revision, there were explicit 
bindings to those commands.  Can you give steps to reproduce the problem you're 
seeing? 
 
The keybinding definitions read as follows - could it be that the definitions
need to be in upper case?


-- snip --

	  &lt;keyBinding
	        keySequence="Ctrl+Arrow_Right"
	        contextId="org.eclipse.ui.textEditorScope"
	        commandId="org.eclipse.ui.edit.text.goto.wordNext"
	        keyConfigurationId="org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration"&gt;
	  &lt;/keyBinding&gt;
	  &lt;keyBinding
	        keySequence="Ctrl+Arrow_Left"
	        contextId="org.eclipse.ui.textEditorScope"
	        commandId="org.eclipse.ui.edit.text.goto.wordPrevious"
	        keyConfigurationId="org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration"&gt;
	  &lt;/keyBinding&gt;

As I said, these key bindings work for me.  I don't understand what you mean by 
not work.  Could you explain a bit more, please? 
 
Line 183 of KeyStroke converts the token to upper case before doing the 
comparison. 
hm, seems that after doing the following conversions, the Arrow_Left/Right
bindings work again (of course I don't have a plausible explanation for this):

Enter -&gt; CR
Delete -&gt; DEL
Backspace -&gt; BS
I still don't see the problem, but if you're happy.... 
*** Bug 79817 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I20041130:
- open new workspace
- create new Java file in new Java project
- place caret in the middle of a non-empty line
- press Shift+Enter
-&gt; the line wrapped at the caret position, rather than a new line would have 
been created below the caret line
- undo
- press Ctrl+Shift+Enter
-&gt; the line wrapped at the caret position, rather than a new line would have 
been created above the caret line
- undo
- press Ctrl+Backspace
-&gt; nothing happens rather than the previous word would have been deleted
- press Ctrl+Delete
-&gt; nothing happens rather than the next word would have beed deleted

There are a couple of issues:
- This happend when we removed the deprecations in the command extensions in 
our xml files. This might be unrelated.
- My original comment talks about 'goto next/previous word'. This is wrong. 
Should have been 'delete next/previous word'.
- The command extension point description should point out valid values for 
the attributes. This is currently not the case.
- Attribute value 'CR' rather than 'Enter' is not a good choice. The key we 
refer to is 'Enter' or 'Return' not 'CR' or 'LF' or 'CRLF'.
I ran in a similar problem when I used M1 in the deprecated 'keySequence'
(instead of 'string') attribute: both attribute descriptions do not mention M1
but only 'string' supports M1. An explanation could be that M1 has been added
with 3.0 but this is not visible for the reader of the extension point doc.
Therefore the doc should either list the possible values for the deprecated and
the new attribute or list which values are new and not supported by the
deprecated attribute.
*** Bug 79890 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Regarding comment #8.  You have them backward: string is deprecated and 
keySequence is the current practice.  I've added notes to the schema about the 
syntax that is expected for modifier keys. 
 
Regarding comment #7.  I see that you have not made the changes suggested in 
comment #1.  This is why those keys don't work.  Now, looking at the "delete" 
commands, it also appears that it is "Backspace" instead of "BS".  I've added 
notes to the schema about the syntax that is expected for special keys and 
non-printable ASCII keys. 
 
If you feel that we should support Backspace and Return and Enter, then please 
open a separate bug.

Paul, this is an enhacement request for the GLA formatter to select what type 
of formatting it wants to use.
Need more information:  What is the scenario for reading the CommonBaseEvents?  
From a file?  In the editor?
After finding out more information on this feature I am returning it.  The 
problem to be solved by this feature is that some CommonBaseEvent field values 
shown in the Log View are missing newline characters so the data is shown as 
one line when it should be shown as multiple lines as in the original log file.

This behaviour is caused by the GLA adapter file used to parse the log file.  
The Extractor rule includes the replaceLineBreaks="true" and specifies some 
other symbol to replace the line breaks.  This is working as designed.  This 
problem can only be fixed by modifying the adapter file to not specify 
replaceLineBreaks="true" or to add substitution rules to put the newline 
characters back into the data (ie replace the new linebreak symbol with real 
newline characters).

Therefore there is no GLA code changes required.  The owner of the adapter file 
will be asked to fix the problem.

A new class called SequenceNumbersByTime was created to store the sequence numbers base on timestamps.  I changed both the CBEFormatter and the abstract accecc and error log classes to use this new class for setting sequenceNumber in the CommonBaseEvent objects.  Therefore, support was added for both rules-based and static parsers.

Platform/UI should declare a retargetable toggling action/command for "Link with
Editor". Currently, almost every decent view that shows editable elements has
its own view toolbar button "Link with Editor". I would like to toggle these
buttons via a keyboard shortcut (and the shortcut should be the same in every
view :-).

I'm not sure whether this should go into to the IDE or the RCP layer, but I'm
sure you'll find a good place.
Supporting a key bindings does not require defining a retargetable action, just
a command.  This should go in the IDE, not the generic workbench.
The Navigator's Link with Editor action should use it too.

There are a few others like this too (e.g. Collapse All).

Nick: arguably, anything to do with global actions could now be considered the 
domain of commands.  Either we should eliminate the [GlobalActions] component 
area, or all the "[Commands] request:" should be reassigned to [GlobalActions]. 
I suggest we keep [GlobalActions] to mean any actions defined globally by the IDE.

Moving Dougs bugs
There are currently no plans to work on this feature.

I find myself pushing the "link with editor" button of the package explorer (twice) quite frequently. Really what I want when I do this is to just get some context for the open editor. I suspect that's the root of the original request here as well. Perhaps we should investigate mechanisms to provide that context and then implement a command (and keybinding) for it.

As part of the conversion  for bug 154130 we should make this a command.

Mike, I think your use case is not exactly the subject of this bug.

This bug requests a retargetable "Link with Editor" action that should work when a view is active and that view supports linking to the editor input -- in fact just a keybinding for all the existing view toolbar actions.

I guess what you need is "Navigate &gt; Show In &gt; ..." . E.g. when you want to reveal the current java editor input, press "Alt+Shift+Q P". For shorter shortcuts, see bug 38789.

AFAICS, this bug does not need any new support form the commands framework -- it's simply a matter of declaring the command (and maybe a retargetable action).
&gt; press "Alt+Shift+Q P" ...

That's funny: Pressing "Alt(er...Command)+Shift+Q" on the Mac means "exit all apps and log out".


&gt; That's funny: Pressing "Alt(er...Command)+Shift+Q" on the Mac means "exit all

Oops, sorry for my monotheistic advice ;-). And it was the wrong command anyway. The "Alt+Shift+Q *" shortcuts ("Command+Option+Q *" for carbon lifeforms) only open a view.

The right shortcut for "Show In" is "Alt+Shift+W *" (which translates to "Command+Option+W *" on the Mac).

I have the Package Explorer open all the time and this really does nothing for me if it's already opened (besides having the workbench switch to that as my active part). The scenario described by McQ in comment #6 is exactly the same thing I go through everyday. I use Open Resource and Open Type all the time and I'd really just like a hotkey for 'Link with Editor' so that I can quickly my Package Explorer will scroll to where it needs to be.

If we need to declare a new command, let's do that. If we need to write a new retargetable action too, let's do that too!

Paul, let me know if you want some help with this. If you can point me to the right places, I'll see if I can brew up a patch. :)
Remy, the 2 "bits" we can easily do in the platform are create a Link With Editor command and change the resource navigator so that the nav action uses the correct action definition id.

I would suggest putting the command in org.eclipse.ui to make it available to all editors (since they must all have an IEditorInput) although I'm not adamant about that.

Patch to add a 'Link with Editor' command.

I set the binding's category to be 'In Windows' although I'm not sure if that's what's desired. The key binding works if you're in the Navigator view but nothing seems to be happening if I'm in an editor?

That's because we activated the handler for the Resource Navigator.

To have it work for editors we would have to write a default handler that toggled the navigator link preference.  But that would work for the Resource Navigator only ... in order to get it to work for the PackageExplorerPart we would need to make it key off of the same preference.  Then anybody else that wanted to take advantage of the command would also have to key off of that preference.

Note that JDT defines a "Show in Package Explorer" command.  I normally unbind Ctrl+P from Print and bind it to this instead.
It has the advantage of not being a toggle (unlike Link with Editor).

&gt; the problems I had before are gone. 

Note to Manfred, when you are satisfy with the fix.

Sébastien Veyrière:
'	In order to enable the "rearrange feature", you need to 
call "SDWidget.setReorderMode(true)" in your loader. The user will then be able 
to rearrange the lifeline using a Drag and Drop gesture.
	Two new methods have been added to allow the loaders to maintain the 
reodering consistency when the pages change or when a previously reodered 
diagram is restored
	
		- SDWidget.getLifelineReoderList: this method return an 
ArrayList which represents the reoder sequence performed by the user. Each 
arrayList element is of type Lifeline[2] with Lifeline[1] inserted before 
Lifeline[1] in the diagram (Of course, each ArrayList element must use the same 
Lifeline reference than the one stored in the frame using Frame.addLifeline)
		-Frame.reorder(ArrayList): This method programmatically reoders 
the frame (the parameter and comment regarding reference are the same than for 
getLifelineReoderList)

	A "Drag and Drop collapsing" feature has also been add. By default this 
feature is disabled. If you when to use it in your loader, you just have to 
implement the ISDCollapsingProvider and set it in the SDView. Your Collapsing 
provider will then be called back when the user will request two lifelines to 
be merged using a Drag and Drap gesture.'

When using the search view, I like to click on my search results to open an
editor with the place in the code where they have been found. But I also like to
have the search results configured as a fast view, so that they disappear
automatically once the view loses focus. But the current behaviour of fast views
(i.e. close on double-click) makes it painful to browse the results, as each
time I open one in the editor, the view is closed.

The behavior I would like to have is as follows: Clicking (or double-clicking,
doesn't matter...) on a search result should show the result in the editor, but
not close the search view. The search view should only be closed when it loses
focus (e.g. when I click on the editor to actually work with something I found).
This would allow to effectively browse the results, inspect the code and still
using the advantage of the fast view, which is that it disappears when I'm done
browsing and move to editing.
This used to work in 2.1.x (old) Search.

Either new search broke this or the open methods changed slightly when switching
to new look and/or RCP.

I seem to remember that we actually decided to make "step next" (via the arrow
buttons) leave the focus on the search view (and thus not close the fast view),
and to move the focus on double click (and close the fast view).
Another thing you could do is set the open mode to single-click: this will leave
the Search view open for most editors.
Yes with single-click (sc) mode it seems to work. But in double-click (dc) mode,
what's the rationale then behind closing the view on dc? AFAIK a sc in sc mode
should have the same semantics as a dc in dc mode, which is to open the
selection. So something in dc mode seems to be broken.

 
It seems to be a general (platform) rule that double click should open a 
editor and give focus to it what hides the fast view.
That's convenient for people having the fast view over the editor area.

I personnaly don't like this behaviour as I have a perspective arrangement 
where the editor is fully visible also when a fast view is open. Browsing 
through resoluts would be nice but is not really possible with the current 
rule.

It's probably a bug that single click has a different behaviour than double 
click.

Moving to platform. Make this configurable? Or hide the fast view only if the 
focus view is really under the fast view?
This is a zombie bug. It's been killed a  couple of times already but it keeps
coming back :-). I think we're looking at 3 interaction modes here:

1) Stepping through results (basically, what you do with the down/up arrows in
the search results view). Used when just browsing code, for example. 
2) Find a result and go work at that location (i.e. find a call site and fix the
call to do something else).
3) Step and work repeatedly. The case would be where you have to fix something
at twenty different call sites of a method. 

I think 1 and 2 are well covered by the current functionality. How about we have
a "show next result" action in the editor, which selects the next search result
in the search results view and sets the focus on the search results view (it
doesn't have to be contributed by the editors, just available in the editors,
e.g. something global). The user could then use the search result keys (or just
enter) to get to the next result (in the editor). Am I making sense?
Hmm, this doesn't really cover my use-case. I want to have random-access to all
the results, else why would I need the search results view at all? Often for
example I search for references to a class to see how it is used by other
people. I might get quite a bunch of matches from which I want to inspect a
subset which seems interesting to me. I actually never even use the 'next' and
'previous' buttons, they don't fit my workflow.

Now you should minimize all the views except the one containing the search view. This allows the behavior you're asking for  (and the Search view won't 'mask' the editor that you're looking at.</WithStack>

Usability bug

I am working with the Java browsing view with the 'Projects', 'Packages',
'Types' and 'Members' views and have several other views configured as fast
views. Whenever I open one of the other views (i.e. 'Synchronize'), the
'Packages', 'Types' and 'Members' views are emptied because (I guess) the
'Projects' view loses its selection. I would be nice if the content of these
views could be persisted until next time the 'Projects' view actually changes
its selection.

Another case is if I open the Type Hierarchy on one of the types in the 'Types'
view. The new view opens, but the 'Types' view (along with the other browsing
views) is emptied, so I lose my context and have to select the project and
package again if I want to browse to another type in the same package.
dani, please comment
&gt;(I guess) the 'Projects' view loses its selection.
Sorry wrong guess ;-)
The browsing views track the selection.

- team view(s) probably don't act as selection provider at all
- TH view doesn't send the very first initial selection. Once the view is open
and F4 is pressed again the selection is sent and the browsing views correctly
update.

Sending back to Martin to fix the type hierarchy view. After that it can be sent
to Platform-Team.

fixed the type hierarchy problem &gt; 20050517

moving to team
The problem is that the synchronize view does not contain a selection that 
adapts to IResource. The reason for this is that we want to use 
objectContributions in the view but we do not want to have IResource based 
contributions as these may assume that the resource exists locally which is 
not the case in the sync view.

So, the behavior of the Java views is the same for selections in the Sync view 
and in the Bookmarks view (i.e. the views are emptied). I am returning this to 
JDT to consider having the Java views in question track the last selection 
that contained Java elements as opposed to every selection whether it contains 
Java elements or not. Another alternative would be to track the Projects view 
selection when the current selection does not contain Java elements.
See also bug 73744.
The Task, Problems and Bookmark view aren't handled correctly because the
browsing views don't unpack markers and there's no Java element adapter on
IMarker. Just fixed this now i.e. it will track the selection in those views.

This however does not address all concerns (see also bug 73744).

The best might be to add another option to the view menu:
[ ] Link With View
which would be like the already 'Link With Editor' option

1. Install Eclipse as root in /usr/eclipse-3.0
2. ln -s /usr/eclipse-3.0/eclipse /usr/bin/eclipse
3. Run 'eclipse' as a user

Here's a patch that users readlink() to adress the problem, updating the path to startup.jar and also the launcher executable itself. Could you look it over and let me know if this  looks reasonable?

Patch with some fixes

Hi Billy,

I've uploaded a fixed up patch. We've been using this patch in FC for the past couple of months and it works well. Any news on commiting this?
*** Bug 149432 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Moving to equinox / fwk where launcher bug now belongs.
Andrew, has this been fixed in the new launcher?  Should it be fixed for 3.3?
The new launcher does resolve symlinks, but it is more than one level.  The use case at the beginning of this bug works.

However, looking in the patch itself, there seems to be a second use case that does not work:
/usr/bin/eclipse  -&gt; /usr/share/eclipse3.3/eclipse
/usr/share/eclipse3.3/eclipse -&gt; /usr/lib/eclipse

Can someone from Redhat comment on this?  

We actually don't use either case anymore. Right now we install eclipse to /usr/share/eclipse/ but for FHS compliance we can't have arch specificic binaries in /usr/share/. This includes the second case mentioned in comment #9 where there is a symlink from /usr/share/ to a binary in /usr/lib{,64}/. 

To get around this problem, the eclipse binrary is patched to always load from /usr/share/eclipse/ and it is installed directly in /usr/bin/. I would like to make a patch that allows people to set a compile flag to choose an absolute path location for the launcher to load eclipse from but I haven't found the time yet.

As far as this bug is concerned, I think it should be closed and I can open a new one for the requested feature mentioned above. Cheers, Ben
Unforturnately for me, Andrew Niefer's use case is exactly the reason I voted for this bug.

I (want to) have /usr/local/bin/eclipse pointing to /opt/eclipse/eclipse, where /opt/eclipse points to /opt/eclipse-SDK-3.2.1.

OK sorry. I guess the bug should stay open for your use case :) 

Johan, your case works.  Comment #9 is slightly different, the executable is in a different location from the rest of the eclipse install.

Note that eclipse can run with the executable in another location, it just requires some arguments.  Something like /usr/bin/eclipse --launcher.library /usr/lib/eclipse_1009.so -startup /usr/share/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.0.v2007.jar

From the RCP newsgroup, topic "When does AbstractUIPlugin" initialize preference?

Yes, after some tracing, the preferences are initialized lazily, when the 
Preferences object is
first queried.

But you cannot query the Preferences object, for example in the 
BrowserPlugin constructor. initializeDefaultPluginPreferences() and 
initializePluginPreferences() are both deprecated, using preference 
initializer extension point to set default values turn out to be executed 
after the BrowserPlugin are fully loaded, compare to the case in 
initializeDefaultPluginPreferences() and initializePluginPreferences() which 
are called after the start(BundleContext context). This introduces problems 
where you need to check for certain value during the Plugin initialization.

Poking around some source codes, it turns out most ppl are loading the 
Preferences object and setting the default values in the start(BundleContext 
context) function, which solve my problem for now.

Thanks for the helps.
When should the preference initializer be run?  Existing code that relies on
being able to obtain the values from within the constructor will no longer work
if they move to initializers (with the recent changes, does it even work if they
haven't moved)?  If it's not reasonable to query prefs from the constructor,
what should the behaviour be?  Silent failure, exception, log entry?

test plug-in

I'm not sure I understand the problem yet.

Attached is a test plug-in. It uses a preference initializer to initialize
default preference values. It accesses the default preferences both in the
constructor and in the #start method. Both times it gets the values that is
expected. (the one that was set in the initializer)
Does it also work if you go through the compatibility APIs? 

I did not actually try this myself, just based it on what was being said in the
newsgroup.  If the test case works, then I suggest closing as WORKSFORME.

I'll have to look into it further. It might not work if you have:

public MyPlugin() {
  super();
  getPluginPreferences();
}

In my example I was using:

public MyPlugin() {
  super();
  new DefaultScope().getNode("my_id").get("foo", "bar");

    <WithStack>After long discussion with Vlad,
we need to enhance the PathEntry framework.
The rewrite involves:

- New method getResolvedEntries() on
  ITranslationUnit, ICContainer, ICProject

- Redefinition of ICProject.getResolvedEntries()

- New class ICResource

- New extension on IContainerEntry (IContainerEntry2)
   * getResolvedEntries(ICResource)
   * addListener() --&gt; to allow the container
   to notify of changes.

- Changes to PathEntryManager:
  - No caching for getResolvedEntries(IResource)
  - Testing for IContainerEntry2, to provider
   back and forward compatibility.

- Updated the documentation 8-)
This wrong is targetting CDT-3.0

Reassign to Dave for the first draft.
Raised priority since I will need this soon to integrate with 'per file' SCD.

&gt; Raised priority since I will need this soon to integrate with 'per file' SCD.

Vlad I commited the first part so you can have a quick look
but the changed listener extension is still missing.

look at:

IPathEntryContainerExtension.java

There are 2 new methods
CoreModel.getIncludeEntries(IPath path)
CoreModel.getMacroEntries(IPath path)

The ScannerProvider been updated to use this instead.
Ok the listener is in take a look and let me know.
Allright Vlad, it is done.
Some changes that you should know.  We've remove the listener
ont IPathEntryContainerExtension, the problem was the lifecycle.
So a solution was proposed by dave, instead of calling the listener
all you have to do is calling

CoreModel.pathEntryContainerUpdates(
         IPathEntryContainerExtension container,
         PatheEntryContainerChanged[] changes,
         IProgressMonitor monitor);

That's it on this side reassigning to you.  Let me know
of any problems
Alain,
I played with the code for several days now and found a problem. I will attach
the patch with the changes I made. Basically, I made DiscoveredPathContainer to
implement IPathEntryContainerExtension as well as IPathEntryContainer. Now the
problem that I am seeing is this:

In case of per project profile the container returns all discovered entries
through getEntries() call, as before. It will return appropriate entries for
getIncludeEntries(IPath) and getMacroEntries(IPath).

In case of per file profile the container returns sum of discovered per file
discovered entries so that include paths can be properly displayed in CView. The
container returns resource specific include path and symbol entries for
getIncludeEntries(IPath) and getMacroEntries(IPath) calls respecively.

The problem is in PathEntryManager.getIncludeEntries(ITranslationUnit) (and
corresponding getMacroEntries() function). This function will first add all
include paths from getResolvedEntries() and then the ones from
container.getIncludeEntries(IPath). The result will contain the sum of resource
specific path entries and the resolved ones (which I thought were only for
displaying in CView). On the other hand, if the container (actually
PerFileDiscoveredPathInfo) does not return any entries when getEntries() is
called then PathEntryManager.getIncludeEntries(ITranslationUnit) will correctly
return only resource specific path entries, but the Includes item in CView will
be empty.

Please take a look in the code and let me know what we can do to resolve this
problem. It may as well be that I did not do things the right way.

Thanks,
Vmir

We see the problem ... Been having a discussion with Dave.
Let me get back to you(this afternoon or tomorrow at the latest).
&gt; The problem is in PathEntryManager.getIncludeEntries(ITranslationUnit) (and
&gt; corresponding getMacroEntries() function). This function will first add all
&gt; include paths from getResolvedEntries() and then the ones from
&gt; container.getIncludeEntries(IPath).

Vlad, give it a try again:
If the container is an instanceof IPathEntryContainerExtension, the
entries should not be cache at all .. The container should be query.
I think this is what we've agreed on.

Let me know of the result
The enhancement has been implemented as a part of scanner cofiguration
correctness feature for CDT 3.0.

Thanks Alain.</WithStack>

all you have to do is calling

CoreModel.pathEntryContainerUpdates(
         IPathEntryContainerExtension container,
         PatheEntryContainerChanged[] changes,
         IProgressMonitor monitor);

That's it on this side reassigning to you.  Let me know
of any problems
Alain,
I played with the code for several days now and found a problem. I will attach
the patch with the changes I made. Basically, I made DiscoveredPathContainer to
implement IPathEntryContainerExtension as well as IPathEntryContainer. Now the
problem that I am seeing is this:

In case of per project profile the container returns all discovered entries
through getEntries() call, as before. It will return appropriate entries for
getIncludeEntries(IPath) and getMacroEntries(IPath).

In case of per file profile the container returns sum of discovered per file
discovered entries so that include paths can be properly displayed in CView. The
container returns resource specific include path and symbol entries for
getIncludeEntries(IPath) and getMacroEntries(IPath) calls respecively.

The problem is in PathEntryManager.getIncludeEntries(ITranslationUnit) (and
corresponding getMacroEntries() function). This function will first add all
include paths from getResolvedEntries() and then the ones from
container.getIncludeEntries(IPath). The result will contain the sum of resource
specific path entries and the resolved ones (which I thought were only for
displaying in CView). On the other hand, if the container (actually
PerFileDiscoveredPathInfo) does not return any entries when getEntries() is
called then PathEntryManager.getIncludeEntries(ITranslationUnit) will correctly
return only resource specific path entries, but the Includes item in CView will
be empty.

Please take a look in the code and let me know what we can do to resolve this
problem. It may as well be that I did not do things the right way.

Thanks,
Vmir

We see the problem ... Been having a discussion with Dave.
Let me get back to you(this afternoon or tomorrow at the latest).
&gt; The problem is in PathEntryManager.getIncludeEntries(ITranslationUnit) (and
&gt; corresponding getMacroEntries() function). This function will first add all
&gt; include paths from getResolvedEntries() and then the ones from
&gt; container.getIncludeEntries(IPath).

Vlad, give it a try again:
If the container is an instanceof IPathEntryContainerExtension, the
entries should not be cache at all .. The container should be query.
I think this is what we've agreed on.

Let me know of the result
The enhancement has been implemented as a part of scanner cofiguration
correctness feature for CDT 3.0.

Thanks Alain.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Some APIs that have been added to handle 1.5 atttributes need to be cleanup.
Some names have changed in the latest JVM specs since 3.0.
These API should not be used by clients yet as they are related to 1.5 code.
Released first batch of changes.
IAnnotation
   added getTypeName()
IAnnotationComponentValue
   renamed getAttributeValue() into getAnnotationValue()
   getAttributeValue() has been deprecated and will be remove after 3.1M4
   added char[] getEnumConstantName()
   added char[] getEnumConstantTypeName()

Jim,

Are these changes ok for you?
These look fine. A more general question re: all these methods.
There are a couple of ways to interpret "This is initialized only if the tag 
item is X.".
(a) The client may assume that null will be returned if the tag item is not X.
(b) The client must not call this method if the tag item is not X.
Since clients may implement this method, it's important to be clear what the 
contract is. I'd suggest reading (a).
Jim, a) is doable for the IAnnotationComponentValue, but it is not doable for
the IConstantPoolEntry class where some methods don't return an object.
I will change the implementation to return null when the constant is not the
expected one for the IAnnotationComponentValue.
Clarified API.
Jim, please review them.
IAnnotationComponentValue and IConstantPoolEntry.
Specs as fine. Closing.

    <WithStack>in the new dependencies view, fragments have the icons of plugins.

For example, open dependencies on org.eclipse.swt, you will see that 
org.eclipse.swt.win32 has the blue (plugin) icon, not the pink (fragment) 
icon. (Problem 1)

Now, focus on 'org.eclipse.swt.win32'.  Go to the history pull down, you will 
notice that the swt.win32 icon now has a red X overlay. (Problem 2).

Problem 3: Launch eclipse where the plugins view would initially appear on a 
previously remembered input (e.g. the pde.ui plugin).  You will see that the 
history icon is disabled.  Now focus on 'ant.core' or something, the history 
will only contain ant.core, not pde.ui as well.
When is it going to finish (the dependencies view bugs)? :-)

Pretty useless stack trace with no line numbers ;-)
Luckily I am psychic and I think I know what happened.
Good thing....I hear that after 30 your psychic abilities dwindle.... :-)
"you hear"?  don't you mean "you remember"? :-)
Memory is another thing that goes...
Fixed.
The problem was occurring when you double-click on a search hit that maps to a 
workspace plugin that has a manifest.mf/plugin.xml combo, like the 
core.runtime plugin for example.</WithStack>
