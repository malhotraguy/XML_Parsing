    <WithStack>The current way how to apply a patch isn't very intuitive. At least it wasn't 
for me. Here is what I think could improve it:

- there should be an action "Apply Patch" in the team menu. It is hard to 
  understand that I have to active "Compare Patch" to apply a patch.
- the wizard that pops up should guide me through the process of applying the
  patch.
  First page: like the current one. The only thing that suprised me a little bit
    is the fact that when I create a patch for a folder I have to apply the same
    patch to the project. The reason for this is that the index entry is always
    relative to the project even if I create it for a folder.
  Second page to find best patch settings: using check boxes to indicate that a
    patch item can be applied is strange. I would prefer having a error icon
    instead. When selecting an item that can be applied I would like to
    see that applied patch (compare current source with source that has applied
    patch) instead of seeing the content of the patch. If the user checks an 
    item that can't be applied then the Next and Finish button is disabled.
  Third page (currently not present): contains an compare editor showing the 
    current source and the source with checked patches applied. I was really
    suprised that I got a separate editor for this and the dialog was
    closed. Best would be if the editor in that dialog would be editable.
One the second page there should be a sash between the check box tree viewer 
and the compare viewer
The third page should show me the *.rej file if produced like the current 
compare editor does
for 2.1 M5 see #29791,
the other items after 2.1
I don't believe any of these comments apply to the current Apply Patch wizard
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

    <WithStack>1. Drag a file from Eclipse Navigator to Windows Explorer
==&gt; file still visible in Eclipse even though the file was moved in the FS
2. Do some operation on the file (e.g. rename)
==&gt; Problem dialog
This requires support from SWT.
This has been supported in SWT since Oct 22, 2001.
See bug report http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4831

The fix is for the Navigator to detect the case and handle it accordingly

public void dragFinished(DragSourceEvent event){
    if (event.detail == DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE) {
	// fix the Navigator display but do not delete the file
    }
    ...
}
We need to copy the file to the local history on dragSetData and to a refresh 
from local on dragFinished.

Need to check if there is API to copy a file to local history.
There is no Core API to explicitly add a file to the local history. 

This is taken care of automatically (in conjuction with specifying the 
KEEP_HISTORY flag) when you perform other operations which modify the contents 
of the file. History is (optionally) kept for:
- delete
- move
- setContents
- appendContents
But in this case we are not calling any API. The OS (the drag target) does the 
move. So I have to copy the file to the local history before the file gets 
moved by the OS. Getting the contents and than setting the same contents could 
do the trick but it looks like a hack.
Need to handle DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE and do a refresh on the workspace file, 
because the OS is moving the file under us in this case.
There will be no local history in this case.
This is a dup PR.

    <WithStack>On my linux machine the defualt background color for labels is grey.
The banner grapbics (wizards, welcome page, preference dialog etc.) 
have a white background which makes them stand out. 
A transparent background is probably not a ggod idea so we may be stuck with
this problem.
This is fixed right?
The thing that was changed is that we no longer slam the background colour to 
match the icon. The icon currently has a white background and would need to be 
replaced with a transparent icon to match settings with non white labels.

If you suspend a thread manually (i.e. by pressing the suspend button), and 
select a variable, the Detail pane will show 
&lt;com.sun.jdi.IncompatibleThreadStateException&gt;.

This is because JDI doesn't allow to perform an invocation on a thread that has 
not been suspended by jdi request.

Maybe a more explicit message indicating the limitation should be displayed 
instead.
Fixed.

Note, I found a new bug while fixing this one (bug# 14283)
Please verify.
The first time I select the variable I get a error message:
[toString() unavailable - thread must be suspended by breakpoint or step] 
(id=24)
This is a great improvement, but I think we could lose the (id=24) part?

If I reselect the variable, I get:
com.sun.jdi.IncompatibleThreadStateException occurred invoking method. (id=24)

Is this intended?
This is a bug.
Fixed (and removed (id = X)). please verify.

Fix for {@docRoot} and relative links

This patch contains
- an improved version of the @docRoot patch from bug 233243
- fix for relative links (sets the head &gt; base tag)
- a workaround for bug 237903 to make relative links work with Javadoc from the file system

With Javadoc from an archive, the help system is used to resolve the base URL. This handles 'jar:...' URLs, which would not work otherwise (and we don't have the callback to implement this without a web server, see bug 149022).

See bug 24227 for {@inheritDoc} and bug 72139 and bug 152029 for {@value}.
*** Bug 65310 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

Fix 2

Improves the workaround for bug 237903.
Released Fix 2 to HEAD. Setting target to 3.4.1 (will decide later whether we will really release it into 3.4.1).
Will not backport this to 3.4.1. Relative links are not a big problem for 3.4 users, and it's not a regression.
Verified in I20080805-0100.
*** Bug 246490 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bummer that it wont be fixed in 3.4.1 it just makes most links useless (in all the javadocs i use only ones from source code has working links).

    <WithStack>Labels of the container nodes in the preview page of the Rename refactoring are
a constant string: "update method references" or "update method reference"

This is bad - it should show the name of the CU like in the type refactoring.
Furthermore it should name declarations changes as such and not as reference
changes.
i think this is fixed now - will check
fixed
The preview still shows the change of the method declaration as 'Update method 
occurence', which is the same text used for method references to update.
Is this intentional?

    <WithOutStack>1. create:
class A{
	void f(){
		toString();
	}
}

2. select the toString call
3. F2
what you see is more than is defined in Object::toString javadoc

    <WithStack>20122:
The generated code does not honor the code formatter settings:
example: created variable assignement
String rr="JUnit "+Version.id();

The trick to do this without formatting the user code would be to let the 
formatter work first on a string containing only generated code:
- String rr=xx; -&gt; String rr= xx;
- The replace xx with the user code
the test case you gave should not be modified - user code was rr="Junit" ...
(i.e. not conforming to the setting) - it is preserved that way.

there is, however, a bug in the refactoring:
int y= 0+0;
now, select the expression (together with the leading space)
the new temp declaration is:
int temp=  0+0;
which is incorrect

(compact assignment pref is on)
user code was 
  System.out.println("JUnit "+Version.id());
generated code was
  String rr="JUnit "+Version.id();
  System.out.println(rr);


ok, this i don't believe :)
i just checked it on the latest (which is same as 0205) and it works correctly

adopting the bug anyway - the other thing needs fixing
after a conversation with MA i know what the problem is:
we should not assume that any code formatter preference means this or that 
(like we assume that 'compact assignment' means a sinle space after the '=' 
sign). whenever possible we should let the formatter format any generated code.

that way we're much more flexible, not hardcode things (what the above 
assumptions really are - hardcoding) and will be ready when pluggable code 
formatters show up.

that is another bug though - see bug#9443
this is fixed - bug#9443 remains open</WithStack>

Use Ctrl tab to get to Combo box in toolbar.
Use Ctrl arrow key to get the drop down list and arrow in the list to change 
perspective.
This causes the perspective to change immediately - aside - shouldn't Eclipse 
use default selection rather than selection to determine that the combo box has 
changed value?
After the perspective has changed, hit Ctrl Tab and you get a Widget is 
disposed error.

I believe that items are being set in the Tab list by Eclipse, then when the 
perspective changes, the items are being disposed but the TabList is not being 
updated.

In Eclipse, tab to the Toolbar (top or side).
Try to activate the File menu using 'Alt F'. Nothing happens.
Tab so that the focus is in something other than the toolbar.
Try to activate File menu using 'Alt F'. The file menu opens.
Works correctly on linux-motif.
This is a bug in Windows.  The tool bar window proc does not pass WM_SYSCHAR to 
the DefWindowProc.

    <WithStack>The virtual machine on many embedded devices does not do runtime optimation. It 
would therefore be nice if the compiler performed certain optimizations which 
although they could have been done by the programmer they would interfere with 
the understanding of the code. In the following class (initialization and error

Eclipse's compiler should have an option to perform this kind of optimization.

We might consider more bytecode optimizations after R2.0.
Is it ok ? It will not get lost.
The current optimizations assume that a JIT will be executing the bytecode. For 
MIDP devices it seems that the bytecodes are executed directly. An option for 
inlining or similar optimizations would really help for these platforms.
Shmuel,

Would you be interested in implementing these changes ?

As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

- source start is 36 which is ok, but source end is 65 which includes the /*]*/ 
comment.
In which case do you want to the trailing comment to be part of the declaration of a type?
Never? 
Only when it is a javadoc comment?
The management of comments in general is not implementing yet 
in the new AST world except for the javadoc comment in front of types, methods, initializers and 
fields.
I change this in the DOM/AST API. Now no method declarations, field declarations, initializers, 
type declarations, import declarations or package declarations include the trailing 
comment.
Please confirm this is the behavior you expect. It is specified that way in the DON/AST 
API.

    <WithStack>The Add From Local History dialog is inaccessible from the keyboard. If you 
open it and hit tab the key is ignored so none of the widgets can be access 
from the keyboard.
Actually Cntr-Tab works. However, it could be made easier :-)
Ctrl-Tab is used for tabbing between views. Users expect the tab to be the key 
used for dialog navigation.
Usuability rather than accessibility issue as it is now possible to use the

1. No checks if new variable shadows a instance variable / static variable used 
later
2. for (int k= 0, i= k + 9; k &lt; 10; k++) {}
 'k + 9' can be extracted.
3. Doesn't allow to reuse variable names of already taken variables (is ok to 
do if later in the code the variable is not read anymore
 (not so easy, needs a flow analysis)
added tests for 1 and 2
2 is now reported as an error
3 is fixed

1 should be improved but lower prio.
closing as LATER
reopen if you disagree
reop

I would prefer to get an error dialog. I might have selected the wrong element

Clicking away a dialog is less heavy weight than swapping a view (I have

Seems that this is already in F1. If you drag in a working copy element that 
does not exist in the original, you get a dialog saying that you have to save

- Supports HCR

Given this information, we can't detect that the VM won't succeed with your example.

Perform a step return in a method that will take a long time to complete.

The Thread and stack frames update correctly to indicate the stepping, but the 
toolbar actions (the step, resume, suspend actions) do not update to reflect 
the current state.

Same for a long step over.

Time to put back all of the updateButtons calls in the LaunchViewEventHandler
My mistake, this is in 20020122++.
Fixed as the actions now listen to debug events.
Please verify.

Perform a step return in a method that will take a long time to complete.

The Thread and stack frames update correctly to indicate the stepping, but the 
toolbar actions (the step, resume, suspend actions) do not update to reflect 
the current state.

Same for a long step over.

    <WithStack>The dialog for 'Find Strings to Externalize...' has a table widget which can 
grow (horizontally) out of the dialog bounds. Either this is an SWT layout 
problem or wrong usage of the layouts.
The dialog should a reasonble fixed default size and not grow out of bounds.
addressed table height problem 
fixing the dialog size is not the correct thing to do imo (screen resolutions 
chnage)

could not reproduce the table width problem - please give an example of a cu
on which it grows too large
reopen - it's only on linux
can you try it now?
works for me!

    <WithStack>The compilation units which have no strings to externalize are of no interest. 
They should be removed from the table.

Otherwise, the action should be called 'Count Strings to Externalize...'.
it is called 'find' because you can double click on the entreies and the NLS 
wizards opens (will have to add some hint for that)

to remove cus with 0 strings - check the checkbox.
the info might be interesing for some people (is it?)
added the double-click hint message
and changed the default to not show cus with 0 strings
rest works as designed
Sorry for continuing on this, but if double click allows to externalize the 
strings, there should be a button with acts on the current selection as well.
A double click should only be a short cut for doing an action, there needs to 
be a more explicit open action as well.

The ratio between the panes should be persisted in the memento and remember as

everything is stored, but store memento is only called on exiting workspace.
I also think that closing a perspective window should invoke storing the

    <WithStack>Build 20020122

When I add the SWT project using the self-hosting tool, 
it indicates a warning in the task list:
Missing library: /org.eclipse.swt/ws/win32/swt-pi.jar.

The build path property page shows:
swt-pi.jar - \org.eclipse.swt\ws\win32
swt.jar - org.eclipse.swt/ws/win32
...

SWT's plugin.xml has:
   &lt;library name="$ws$/swt-pi.jar"&gt;
      &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
   &lt;/library&gt;
   &lt;library name="$ws$/swt.jar"&gt;
      &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
   &lt;/library&gt;

Why does the self-hosting plugin introduce an absolute path for swt-pi.jar?
Even more curious, why does it get it right for swt.jar?
Each binary project must have its own build path set so that projects can be 
built when source projects reference binary projects. In the case of SWT, 
swt.jar is present so it is correctly resolved, but swt-pi.jar is only 
applicable to Linux GTK. This is a temporary solution (the JAR will be moved to 
a fragment that will only be shipped for the right platform/window system 
combination).

A bug explaining this already exists: 7666

    <WithStack>Build 20020109  WinNT 4.0 SP6 
Recent changes to Workbench preferences leads to a proliferation of Debug 
perspectives.  In order to be able to open multiple perspective windows, I have 
had to uncheck "Reuse Perspectives with same input"  My preference for "Open a 
new Perspective" is set to "In a new window".  This allows me to open multiple 
Java perspectives.  However, it also leads to the creation of a new Debug 
perspective every time I perform a debug launch from one of my Java 
perspectives.  It would be nice if a debug launch from a Java perspective 
worked like a debug launch from a Debug perspective, the Debug perspective is 
reused.  At minimum an option should be added to allow for Debug Perspective 
reuse.

Can't reproduce with 20020123 build. A couple of questions:
1. Which build was this with? 
2. Did you have the file open in the default Java editor? 
3. Do you actually see any wrapped lines? 
4. Is the horizontal scroll bar visible before you walkback (I'm assuming you 
get an internal error).

1. 20020122
2. Yes.
3. I don't remember.
4. I don't remember.

For 3 and 4, the workbench window was quite small initially, so it's entirely 
possible that some lines required the horizontal scrollbar. I just can't recall.

Can't repeat now.
James is running on Motif
Tried to recreate with 20020123 build on Linux-Motif.  Could not.  The error is 
very strange.  Based on the walkback, word-wrap would have to be set for the 
StyledText widget, but WRAP is not a style that is specified for the Java 
Editor.  So we're not sure how the StyledText widget got into a wrapped state.  
KR checked for uses of the WRAP style in JDT and found none.
SWT.WRAP is specified for StyledText in the following two places:
org.eclipse.help.internal.ui.ContextHelpDialog.createInfoArea
org.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.AntConsole.createPartControl

If you open context help (F1) anywhere you will see that the space where the 
StyledText widget should be is not drawn. There is no log message indicating a 
walkback. However, if you click in the StyledText widget you get an internal 
error with the attached stack trace in the log. ContextHelpDialog defines its 
own wrapping StyledTextContent. This is where the exception occurs. 

The Ant Console however does not do its own line wrapping.
James, do you remember having the Ant console or the context help open when you 
got the walkback?

Created attachment 253
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in org.eclipse.help.internal.ui.StyledLineWrapper.getTextRange
I definitely did not have the Ant console open. I did open the help perspective 
at one point today; I closed the entire perspective shortly thereafter, and it 
was not open when this walkback occurred, although it could have been open 
previously.
*** Bug 8188 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 8242 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Do you remember any of your views not repainting after you got the walkback? 
Was your editor still working or did it no longer repaint after the walkback?
Did you ever use Ant (i.e., run an Ant script) yesterday or the day before?
The Ant console is our only lead at this time. There is no other view that uses 
a wrapping StyledText that could have resulted in this stack trace.
I think the views repainted fine after this.
I don't remember whehter the editor still worked or not.
I never ever used Ant.

*** Bug 8360 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Ok, looks like we can rule out the AntConsole as being the culprit for this 
walkback &lt;g&gt;.
Checked all references of StyledText to see whether there's a place that 
creates a StyledText with bogus styles (e.g., SWT.CASCADE which is the same as 
SWT.WRAP). They are all calling it with proper styles.
*** Bug 8380 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 8382 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Note that a PR has been opened against the Help component for the 
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.  This is a Help bug not a StyledText bug.

http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8398

The initial problem of this PR (walkback when resizing) is unrelated to the 
Help bug (as far as we know) and has not been able to be reproduced.
Checked write references to caretLine, which is used in 
StyledText.wordWrapResize to call WrappedContent.getLine. I don't see how it 
could get out of range (the exception indicates it was one line past the last 
line) other than WrappedContent having an inconsistent visualLineCount. The 
exception James got could happen if the visualLineCount is greater than the 
actual number of visual (wrapped) lines. Likewise I didn't find anything 
suspicious with regard to the visualLineCount.
I just noticed bug 9191.
Is it possible that this walkback occurred in the new CVS Console? 
That would explain why I couldn't find any WRAP users other than Help and the 
Ant Console.

Yes, it is certainly possible; I likely would have had it open at the time. 
There is something fundamentally wrong with the CVS console. However, none of 
the other duplicate bugs above would have been related to the CVS console as 
none of those people were using it. The CVS console is on my list of things to 
get to the bottom of, I'll let you know if I see this again.

*** Bug 8360 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Ok, looks like we can rule out the AntConsole as being the culprit for this 
walkback &lt;g&gt;.
Checked all references of StyledText to see whether there's a place that 
creates a StyledText with bogus styles (e.g., SWT.CASCADE which is the same as 
SWT.WRAP). They are all calling it with proper styles.
*** Bug 8380 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 8382 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Note that a PR has been opened against the Help component for the 
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.  This is a Help bug not a StyledText bug.

http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8398

The initial problem of this PR (walkback when resizing) is unrelated to the 
Help bug (as far as we know) and has not been able to be reproduced.
Checked write references to caretLine, which is used in 
StyledText.wordWrapResize to call WrappedContent.getLine. I don't see how it 
could get out of range (the exception indicates it was one line past the last 
line) other than WrappedContent having an inconsistent visualLineCount. The 
exception James got could happen if the visualLineCount is greater than the 
actual number of visual (wrapped) lines. Likewise I didn't find anything 
suspicious with regard to the visualLineCount.
I just noticed bug 9191.
Is it possible that this walkback occurred in the new CVS Console? 
That would explain why I couldn't find any WRAP users other than Help and the 
Ant Console.

Yes, it is certainly possible; I likely would have had it open at the time. 
There is something fundamentally wrong with the CVS console. However, none of 
the other duplicate bugs above would have been related to the CVS console as 
none of those people were using it. The CVS console is on my list of things to 
get to the bottom of, I'll let you know if I see this again.

If sync'ed up with a particular stream (HEAD), then load a previous version of 
a given project (e.g. the very last one on the same branch, when a few changes 
got released since then), and synchronize again with the stream.

You'll see that all changes are listed as outgoing ones, when I would expect to 
be able to catchup with these instead.

I think this is another instance of the fact that VCM wants to decide for me 
whether it is outgoing or incoming, when I should be offered to do both, 
depending on my context (a warning for the non-natural one is fine).
When you load a previous version in this case, it is assumed you are replacing 
the resources with those you have loaded. When you sync, you get outgoing 
changes on all resources.

In the new code-base, loading a version will "freeze" you on that version until 
you load HEAD (or a branch) again, just as with other csv clients. This means 
that syncing on a loaded version will show no changes. 
Also note that with the new sync view improvements, it is possible to override 
the direction of any change. (you will be warned before performing "non-
natural" operations).

Can this PR be closed?
The possibility of overriding suggested actions is perfect. I am happy again.

    <WithStack>In Windows Standard Extra Large there are the following problems with the 
Externalize Dialog

The Never Externalize Button is cut off
It is too long
There are no mnemonics for the push buttons
Having "Selected" at the end of the label for each button is wierd
Critical since buttons are cut off.

The layout of the buttons need to be fixed, they should be vertically centered 
relative to the table.

The labels should just be "Translate" "Never Translate" and "Skip"
i did not see buttons cut off - a label was and it's fixed now
also fixed are mnemonics and button labels
Problem is fixed on my machine. I have Windows NT using Windows Standard and
small fonts. Screen resolution is 1280x1024


Please note that for Eclipse to pass it's accessibility review it must be 
usable on extra large and high contrast settings.
it looks like the externalize strings dialog takes on the height of full screen
i removed the hard-coded minimal wizard size from refactoring dialog
