    <WithStack>When i switch to 2.1 presentation and if i have many editors opened (many 
tabs) i cannot scroll between them (i cannot access currently hidden tabs).
Moreover, the menu Window-&gt;Navigation-&gt;Switch to Editor is not functional!! 
Also shortcut for this action (CTRL + E) is not functional.

Thanks!
The missing arrow buttons for scrolling the tab area are covered by bug 78927.
The tab folder supports Crtl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown, also Ctrl+Shift+E allows
you to switch editors. 

However this looks like a bug, the black arrows show up in 3.0.2 but not 3.1.

moving to SWT for comment.
As Florian points out in bug 78927, the arrows are missing because in 3.1 
ToolItems that are clipped are not shown.  This is intentional, see Bug 
15239.  The sizing of the toolbar in the R21 presentation needs to be fixed.

The part about "CTRL + E" not working needs clarification and may be a 
completely separate bug.

I think this bug report should be marked as a duplicate of bug 78927.  Moving 
back to UI for comment.
Veronika, I don't understand.  In the editor area on the R21 presentation the
arrows are now gone since 3.0.  Did we do something to make this happen?
so the problem was that the tool items were not fully visible and now in SWT
these items get hidden and so they are no longer visible.
adding Ed and Gunnar, does anyone have time to look at this? It should be a
simple sizing issue with the arrows on the tabs in the R2.1 presentation?

Oh and this is possibly for RC2 (i.e. this week Wednesday PM (June 8)?
&gt; does anyone have time to look at this?

Why not use bug 78927 (linked to twice in this report) as a starting point?
While I'm not saying that the patch attached to that bug report is certified
to be free of performance or portability issues, I'm a bit surprised by this
recent flurry of trying to find out what the problem is or how to fix it
when someone has already taken the time to look into this - five months ago.
Bug 78927 (missing/clipped arrows) is fixed, so I'm renaming this one to just
cover the Switch to Editor problem.
This looks like a new feature to me. I havn't checked a Eclipse 2.1. Did it
provide the the editor list?

The implementation is not trivial. IMHO the R21 presentation needs to be
reworked to make use of the existing implementation (see
TabbedStackPresentation#showPartList, DefaultPartList, PresentablePartFolder, etc.)

Severity should be adjusted to "enhancement" and the target milestone must be
removed. I don't have the permission to do this.
Updated severity, milestone, and summary to reflect comment #9.
There are no plans to work on this at this time
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

The Browser makes its context menu visible when it receives
ContextMenuListener.OnShowContextMenu.  If possible this should be changed on
motif to show on right MouseDown instead.
If the context menu is coming from Mozilla, then there's not much we can do.
On revisiting this, the pop-up behaviour is fine on motif after all.

However, the problem I now see is that once a custom pop-up is shown then 
clicking elsewhere in the Browser does not dismiss it.  This is probably a 
result of mouse events currently not being fired by the Browser.  To see this 
problem right-click in the Javadoc view.

    <WithStack>If you bring up a text celleditor for direct-editing, and then scroll the 
diagram in such a way that the celleditor would get hidden, the celleditor is

The problem is caused because SWT does not scroll the celleditor once it is

an issue in the framework where 2 files with the same uri are being passed to

This problem is due to that fact that 2 files with the same name but in
different locations are being captured by the build delta and passed to the
validation builder for validation and hence 2 errors are being put out

    <WithStack>Against I20050527-0010.  I'm attaching a screen shot from the Type Access Rules

The clipped link
Martin, don't know if this is use for SWT. 
using ui.forms
Some layout fixes with the FormText went into the last night nightly build. I 
tried to reproduce this in a small test case but could not. Can you give it a 
try again with N20050607 or higher (BTW, I tried the dialog in question but 
the link has been removed, so I had to build a simple test case).
Lowering priority since it is not critical and I cannot reproduce it.
Created attachment 23414
The clipped link with Windows XP look and feel

Here is the clipped link again, in N20050616-0010.  To reproduce, I simply:

1) Create a new Java project
2) Go to Properties &gt; Java Build Path &gt; Libraries
3) Add any library to the build path.
4) Expand the library, highlight "Access rules", hit "Edit..."
5) And see this clipped link.

When I mouse over, the clipping stops, but the single quotes disappear. 
(screenshot to come)
Created attachment 23415
Clipping and quotes disappear on mouse-over

After mouse over.  The clipping is gone, and so are the quotes.
This is related to a bug in focus indication rendering. The link segment used 
to return true from 'isSelectable()' which gave it one pixel margin around the 
text for drawing focus indication. During refactoring, a new 
method 'isFocusSelectable()' was added to IFocusSelectable interface, and this 
method was left orphaned. As a result, HyperlinkSegment and 
ImageHyperlinkSegment always returned 'true', so focus rendering was drawing 
on top of text. Depending on the paint ordering, you could see one segment 
drawing over another, or focus rectangle partially cancelling itself (due to 
XOR painting mode) etc.

The attached patch finally fixes all the focus rendering issues. I tested it 
on Windows extensively (including PDE editors, Help view, Forms examples 
etc.). Needless to say, it also fixes the original problem of this bug.

I will propose this bug as the only bug to be fixed in RC4 for Eclipse Forms.
Added Konrad and Wassim because they are the beneficiaries of the fix (links 
will render better in PDE editors and the Help view).
Created attachment 23495
UI Forms patch that fixes focus and link rendering
Raising priority to P2. This is not a stop-ship, but detracts from 
the 'finished product' feel.
Eclipse Forms patches that involve additions and substractions of pixels 
really make me nervous.

This particular patch is too large/elaborate for my RC4 tolerance level.

I think links currently look fine in the PDE editors.  I'm not sure this is 
critical for 3.1 unless you can prove to me otherwise with a live example.
I don't think pixels have any particular risk level that makes them more scary 
than, say, file management. It is more likely that pixel manipulation skills 
are not common and the provided patch seems scary as a result. If you apply 
the patch, you will notice that most of it consists of manipulating 1 pixel of 
offset and 2 pixels of total width. This compensation is done for 'selectable' 
text segments to make room for the focus rectangle that is rendered around 
these segments. 

This problem was in the code for a while and I was always unhappy about it but 
it was never a major issue because the misalignment was only one pixel. 
However, I do think that now that I have a solid fix in hand, it would be a 
shame to go into 3.1 with a less finished product because we are scared. All 
PDE editors work well with the fix applied, Help view works well, the original 
problem of this defect is gone, and Eclipse Forms examples also work well. 

I am happy to demonstrate the problem and the fix tomorrow.
I also encourage you to check out Eclipse Forms, apply the patch, and go

    <WithOutStack>Against I20050527-0010.  I'm attaching a screen shot from the Type Access Rules
dialog.  Clipping goes away when the link is moused-over.

The clipped link
Martin, don't know if this is use for SWT. 
using ui.forms
Some layout fixes with the FormText went into the last night nightly build. I 
tried to reproduce this in a small test case but could not. Can you give it a 
try again with N20050607 or higher (BTW, I tried the dialog in question but 
the link has been removed, so I had to build a simple test case).
Lowering priority since it is not critical and I cannot reproduce it.
Created attachment 23414
The clipped link with Windows XP look and feel

Here is the clipped link again, in N20050616-0010.  To reproduce, I simply:

1) Create a new Java project
2) Go to Properties &gt; Java Build Path &gt; Libraries
3) Add any library to the build path.
4) Expand the library, highlight "Access rules", hit "Edit..."
5) And see this clipped link.

When I mouse over, the clipping stops, but the single quotes disappear. 
(screenshot to come)
Created attachment 23415
Clipping and quotes disappear on mouse-over

After mouse over.  The clipping is gone, and so are the quotes.
This is related to a bug in focus indication rendering. The link segment used 
to return true from 'isSelectable()' which gave it one pixel margin around the 
text for drawing focus indication. During refactoring, a new 
method 'isFocusSelectable()' was added to IFocusSelectable interface, and this 
method was left orphaned. As a result, HyperlinkSegment and 
ImageHyperlinkSegment always returned 'true', so focus rendering was drawing 
on top of text. Depending on the paint ordering, you could see one segment 
drawing over another, or focus rectangle partially cancelling itself (due to 
XOR painting mode) etc.

The attached patch finally fixes all the focus rendering issues. I tested it 
on Windows extensively (including PDE editors, Help view, Forms examples 
etc.). Needless to say, it also fixes the original problem of this bug.

I will propose this bug as the only bug to be fixed in RC4 for Eclipse Forms.
Added Konrad and Wassim because they are the beneficiaries of the fix (links 
will render better in PDE editors and the Help view).
Created attachment 23495
UI Forms patch that fixes focus and link rendering
Raising priority to P2. This is not a stop-ship, but detracts from 
the 'finished product' feel.
Eclipse Forms patches that involve additions and substractions of pixels 
really make me nervous.

This particular patch is too large/elaborate for my RC4 tolerance level.

I think links currently look fine in the PDE editors.  I'm not sure this is 
critical for 3.1 unless you can prove to me otherwise with a live example.
I don't think pixels have any particular risk level that makes them more scary 
than, say, file management. It is more likely that pixel manipulation skills 
are not common and the provided patch seems scary as a result. If you apply 
the patch, you will notice that most of it consists of manipulating 1 pixel of 
offset and 2 pixels of total width. This compensation is done for 'selectable' 
text segments to make room for the focus rectangle that is rendered around 
these segments. 

This problem was in the code for a while and I was always unhappy about it but 
it was never a major issue because the misalignment was only one pixel. 
However, I do think that now that I have a solid fix in hand, it would be a 
shame to go into 3.1 with a less finished product because we are scared. All 
PDE editors work well with the fix applied, Help view works well, the original 
problem of this defect is gone, and Eclipse Forms examples also work well. 

I am happy to demonstrate the problem and the fix tomorrow.
I also encourage you to check out Eclipse Forms, apply the patch, and go 
through all PDE editors to verify that no cheeze happens in sections that use 
FormText.

    <WithStack>Problem found in R31M7,  same testcase works in R302

I didn't see any open bugs for this problem. 

I created a brand new fragement project (not using osgi style) and referenced 
a Host Plug-in in my workspace.

The java build path shows the "Plug-in dependancies" as empty, it should have 
listed the plugins from the Host Plug-in.

I checked using properites of the fragment project-&gt;Java Build Path-&gt;Libraries 
tab.   It only had "Access rules(no restrictions)"

I tried this on 3.0.2 and it worked correctly,  the "Plug-in dependancies" in 
the fragment project contained the plugins from the Host Plug-in.

The end result of this is that all the imports fail because they can't see any 
of the plugins rendering the fragment useless.
New workspace:
It works if I create a new plugin project (3.0 + no osgi) 
Then create a fragment project with the above plugin as the host.

Seems that PDE in 3.1 does not like the plugin.xml format that works under 
3.0.2

I am trying to figure out what it is about my plugin (3.0 compatible) that 
causes the fragment project in R3.1 to not see the plugin-dependancies

What I am saying is that seems to be a problem with the format of my 
plugin.xml that works on 3.0.2 but doesn't on 3.1


Did more testing... 

The problem is with the "import plugin" version/match statements in the Host 
plug-in's plugin.xml

The &lt;import plugin.../&gt; statement in the host plugin was not satisfied. i.e. 
it required a version that wasn't available.   The host plugin found the 
dependancies (even though they were not satisfied) and compiled ok but the 
fragment apparently does more checking and failed to find the dependances.

The problem is not with the fragment but with the check on the plugin.xml 
import statements.  It would appear that the version/match rule is not checked 
for plugins but is for fragments 


There is an inconsistency between how a plugin checks the version/match rule 
on the import statement and how a fragment checks it.

If plugins don't check the version/match then the fragment shouldn't check the 
host plugin's import statements either.

I wrongly assumed that plugins were checking the version/match rule!

Sorry for all the appends but due to the reduced time left I want to make sure 
I capture everything I find on this.


it's the runtime state that determines if a fragment is resolved or 
unresolved.  If it is unresolved, it loses connectivity with its host plugin 
at development time as it should.

Moving to Platform/Runtime to ensure that the fragment is correctly 
unresolved.  I suspect this is a user error.
It would help if you provided a plugin.xml/fragment.xml for both the host and 
fragment plugins which are causing you problems.  I'm having a hard time 
figuring out what your scenario is.  Does you fragment have any &lt;import 
plugin.../&gt; statements?  Does it import additional plugins that the host does 
not?  Does it import the same plugins as the host but at a different version?

In the runtime State, if a host bundle is not resolved then a fragment bundle 
is not allowed to resolve to the host bundle.  This may be the behavior you 
are seeing, but it is hard to guess without examples of the 
plugin.xml/fragment.xml files.

Attaching testcase to reproduce the problem:

1) unzip the attached zip file
2) create a new workspace

4) switch to the PDE perspective
5) in the "Package explorer" expand the "TestFrag" project (fragment)

It was very misleading that the dependancies in the plugin worked but the 
fragment failed because it tested the version/match rule.
seems like a PDE issue.  May be something ultimately at the state level but 
lets start with PDE UI.
Here it is:

The reason why everything worked fine in 3.0.2 is because PDE back then did 
not use the runtime state to determine dependencies, so it was too lenient 
when it comes to unresolved dependencies.

In this case, the plugin is unresolved because of the unsatisfied dependency.
The fragment therefore now has no host and we ask the runtime for what is 
visible for the fragment, the list is empty and hence the empty container.

As for the plugin, even though it is unresolved, PDE still tries to construct 
a classpath for it by navigating its list of dependencies as specified in the 
manifest.  So we are still consciously more lenient than the runtime when it 
comes to plugins.  If we weren't, then your project would have thousands of 
compiler errors.

This is a judgment call on the part of PDE for more plesant workflows.
What's the deal here?  do people want PDE to be as strict as the state and 
give the plugin an empty classpath too?

Jeff?
(sorry for moving it back to PDE in comment 8.  Wasn't paying attention to 
what was going on...)

Strictly from a class visibility point of view, if a plugin is not resolved, I 
would say that it just should not compile.  That is, it should not build.  
There should be a red X on the project with suggestive text in the error 
message.

I don't know what it would mean for PDE to guess at the classpath.  It might 
get it right but in the end all that is happening is a reduction in the error 
count.

Having said that, I have not considered the usecases.  For all I know I have 
been the ignorant beneficiary of PDE's benevolence and would simply fall on 
the floor crying if the function went away.  I'm doubting most of that but its 
worth consideration.

Wassim, can you outline some workflows that are more pleasant because of your 
handiwork in this area?

Two main issues:
1. We cannot tell the JDT builder to skip a project.  They alone make that 
decision on what needs to be skipped.  so unresolved bundles with no classpath 
will result in empty classpath and a million errors each.

2. A bundle can be inadvertently unresolved very easily, eg. a typo in the 
Require-Bundle header.  The PDE manifest builder marks that with a red x on 
the manifest.  However, if were to exercise tough love, then the whole plugin 
will have no classpath, which is too harsh for development time.

3. As you know, a bundle can be unresolved for many reasons, including for 
example, two singleton bundles by the same id in the same workspace.  PDE is 
working toward supporting such a scenario, but giving all unresolved bundles 
an empty classpath will be a huge step backward wrt usability.

That is why PDE is consciously lenient when it comes to plugins.

For fragments, PDE can't be as lenient of course, since the call to getHost() 
will return null by the state and we therefore leave it at that.

Therefore, I think the current behavior has the right mix of tough love 
without the millions of compiler errors at development time.
I think what we need to do here is if the version constraint is not met as 
error, then the manifest builder should flag it too.  And we leave the 
classpath computation as-is.  sounds good?

This will apply to manifested plugins only of course.  We will not invest in 
old-style plugins.
ok. that sounds fine for 3.1

Some observations:
- 1 and 2 are basically you working around the inabilty to tell JDT that a 
project's classpath is invalid (btw, could you stick a bogus dependency there 
that is not met?  I get "cant' build X because prereq Y is not defined" all 
the time)

- #3 is interesting.  What would be cool is if the resolver resolved as much 
as it could and did as many bindings as it can in all cases.  Then PDE could 
simply check to see if all the prereqs were met.  If they are, the project can 
compile.  If not, it can't.  Something for a future date...
I think you rather get "cant' build X because prereq Y CANNOT be built.  A 
full rebuild is required".  If you only have plugin projects, then you should 
never get into that state.  However, bug 96575 is one example of why this 
might happen.  

Konrad, please add the following checks to the manifest builder:

1. If a plugin is unresolved due a unsatisfied version constraint, flag it at 
the same level as unresolved dependencies.

2. If a fragment has an unresolved host, flag it at the same level as 
unresolved dependencies.
(In reply to comment #12)

&gt; old-style plugins.

I like the idea of at least getting a warning.  I didn't know I had a problem 
until I started working on the fragment and even then I had a hard time 
understanding why it wasn't finding the host plugins dependancies.
As it is I make sure that my environment is targeting the correct platform so 
I wouldn't mind if the plugin just didn't build. Don't generate lots of errors 
just tell me that one of the dependancies didn't match if that is possible.
&gt;I like the idea of at least getting a warning. 

and that you will get.
We already do the checks described in comment #15, but for plugins/fragments 
with manifest.mf.  plugin.xml and fragment.xml have never performed the check 
and we dont have to improve on these at 3.1.

I don't think it is reasonable to rely on everyone moving up to the latest 
format to solve an existing problem.
This is more of an enhancement (ie. extra/better validation messages).

There are a lot of enhancements that can be taken advantage of with the new 
formats which are not there for old-style plugins.  It would be a waste of 
time/effort to backport all these enhancements to the old plugin style format 
that is effectively deprecated as of 3.1.

Konrad, please resolve as appropriate.
With respect to plugin.xml/fragment.xml I mark this as Wontfix.</WithStack>

&gt; I think what we need to do here is if the version constraint is not met as 
&gt; error, then the manifest builder should flag it too.  And we leave the 
&gt; classpath computation as-is.  sounds good?
&gt; This will apply to manifested plugins only of course.  We will not invest in 
&gt; old-style plugins.

I like the idea of at least getting a warning.  I didn't know I had a problem 
until I started working on the fragment and even then I had a hard time 
understanding why it wasn't finding the host plugins dependancies.
As it is I make sure that my environment is targeting the correct platform so 
I wouldn't mind if the plugin just didn't build. Don't generate lots of errors 
just tell me that one of the dependancies didn't match if that is possible.
&gt;I like the idea of at least getting a warning. 

and that you will get.
We already do the checks described in comment #15, but for plugins/fragments 
with manifest.mf.  plugin.xml and fragment.xml have never performed the check 
and we dont have to improve on these at 3.1.

I don't think it is reasonable to rely on everyone moving up to the latest 
format to solve an existing problem.
This is more of an enhancement (ie. extra/better validation messages).

There are a lot of enhancements that can be taken advantage of with the new 
formats which are not there for old-style plugins.  It would be a waste of 
time/effort to backport all these enhancements to the old plugin style format 
that is effectively deprecated as of 3.1.

Konrad, please resolve as appropriate.
With respect to plugin.xml/fragment.xml I mark this as Wontfix.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>If a Table has a visible header, a custom font, and multiple columns, then the  
first column's header uses the default system font rather than the custom font.   
I've reproduced this both in my own application and in a simple test case I  
created (which I can attach if it would be helpful).  
  
Steps to reproduce:  
1.  Create a custom Font.  
2.  Create a Table.  
3.  Make the Table's header visible and set its font to the custom font.  
4.  Add multiple columns to the Table.  
  
Actual results: The first column in the header uses the default system font,  
and all the others use the custom font.  
Expected results: All columns in the header use the custom font.  
  
I'm using SWT/GTK 3.1M7.  I think this is platform-specific, since I don't  
remember this bug occurring in Windows; but I'll have to check to make sure.
What version of GTK+ are you using?
I'm using 2.4.9 at work (SuSE 9.2) and 2.4.14 at home (Fedora Core 3).  The bug
occurs on both.
I'm seeing a similar problem, but it's not quite what you described so I'd like
to confirm.  Basically, table.setFont() on SWT/GTK+ currently only applies to
columns already created.  Columns created after the call to table.setFont() get
the system default font.  I am confused because your bug says the opposite.

Can you please run the following code and tell me what it does on your machine?
 If this is not your bug, can you modify this example to show the problem?

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display display = new Display();
	Shell shell = new Shell(display);
	shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
	Font font = new Font(display, "Sans", 20, SWT.NORMAL);
	Table table = new Table(shell, SWT.NONE);
	table.setHeaderVisible(true);
	TableColumn c1 = new TableColumn(table, SWT.NONE);
	c1.setText("Column 1");
	table.setFont(font);
	TableColumn c2 = new TableColumn(table, SWT.NONE);
	c2.setText("Column 2");
	TableColumn c3 = new TableColumn(table, SWT.NONE);
	c3.setText("Column 3");
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
		TableItem item = new TableItem(table, SWT.NONE);
		item.setText(new String[] { "i" +  i, "i" + i, "i" + i });
	}
	c1.pack();
	c2.pack();
	c3.pack();
	shell.setSize(320, 240);
	shell.open();
	while(!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if(!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
	}
	display.dispose();
}
The opposite was happening to me (the first column got the normal font, and the
others got the large font), though the reason is probably related.  Here's code
that produces the problem I was describing:

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display display = new Display();
	Shell shell = new Shell(display);
	shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
	Font font = new Font(display, "Sans", 20, SWT.NORMAL);
	Table table = new Table(shell, SWT.NONE);
	table.setFont(font);
	table.setHeaderVisible(true);
	TableColumn c1 = new TableColumn(table, SWT.NONE);
	c1.setText("Column 1");
	c1.pack();
	TableColumn c2 = new TableColumn(table, SWT.NONE);
	c2.setText("Column 2");
	c2.pack();
	TableColumn c3 = new TableColumn(table, SWT.NONE);
	c3.setText("Column 3");
	c3.pack();
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
		TableItem item = new TableItem(table, SWT.NONE);
		item.setText(new String[] { "i" +  i, "i" + i, "i" + i });
	}
	shell.setSize(320, 240);
	shell.open();
	while(!shell.isDisposed()) {
		if(!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
	}
	display.dispose();
}

The only difference is the order in which the table's font is set and the
columns are packed.
I forgot to mention -- the code you attached does what you described (only the
first column has the custom font) on my computer.
Yep, reproduced your case here too.  It's all the same problem.  The GtkStyle
isn't attached yet when we look up the font description to apply to the other
columns, and depending on the order of events we get messed up.  I'm tweaking up
a fix now.

As of TPTP 4.6.0, TPTP is in maintenance mode and focusing on improving quality by resolving relevant enhancements/defects and increasing test coverage through test creation, automation, Build Verification Tests (BVTs), and expanded run-time execution. As part of the TPTP Bugzilla housecleaning process (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bugzilla_Housecleaning_Processes), this enhancement/defect is verified/closed by the Project Lead since this enhancement/defect has been resolved and unverified for more than 1 year and considered to be fixed. If this enhancement/defect is still unresolved and reproducible in the latest TPTP release (http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/), please re-open.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Please verify that all defined API's have complete java documentation ( ie a 
clear description of the class and every method, attribute; also verify that 
there are no typos or grammar errors )
To verify the javadoc correctiness, create java doc from File &gt; Export &gt; javadoc
and select the plugin to be generated.

Every schema extension point should also be documented ( all information should 
be provided, including sample implementation )
Remove any commented code from the API code and the plugin.xml.

As a second step please identify any internal classes that are required to be 
declared as APIs ( these should be classes that users are required to implement 
in order to be able to extend the framework ).
Identify any defined API's that should not be in an external package ( as an

When you change the ecore model that is referred by a genmodel (in other words,
the ecore located in the same directory of the genmodel), you don't need to
reload the genmodel (the changes are reconciled automatically when you open the
GenModel editor) **and** you are supposed to do some extra changes, such as
setting the prefix attribute of the genPackage created for your new EPackage.

This is different than, for example, creating a genmodel for a given ecore and
saving the genmodel file in a different directory.  Actually, if you look
closely, you will notice that a copy of the ecore file is created in the
genmodel's directory.

That said, the problem you are seeing is happening because the new GenPackage
doesn't have a 'Prefix' (you can set it through the GenModel editor).  To make
the tree look a little nicer, I've changed the genPackage content provider to
present the name of the EPackage between '[' and ']' when genPackage.getPrefix()
returns null or an empty string.
I am currently using a tool I wrote that generates the ecore files from uml2 
models. Is there a way I can specify the package prefix and the basePackage in 
the ecore file so it would be picked by the genmodel. Having to type that 
information every time a regenerate the ecore is very error prone. May be 
somekind of annotation I can attach to the EPackage that specifies the prefix 
and the basePackage?
We don't have anything that would do that for you.

That said, maybe your tool could reconcile the ecore and gen models (look at 
the GenModelEditor.initialize(GenModel) method) and then adjust the 
genPackages setting their prefixes (which are usually the 'non qualified' name 
of the ePackage, uppercasing the first letter) and basePackages.
Thnx for the info. I didn't know I didn't have to reload the genmodel. But that 
solves my problem. At least I have to enter the info only once in the genmodel.
You can close the bugzilla if you want to.
I glad it solved your problem.  We will be closing this defect when we publish
our next build.

If possible would like About graphic to be flush to bottom border. Height of
text area to right of graphic determines height of area where graphic is
placed. Not sure if this is the cause here, but can you see if it can be
adjusted to remove the 1 pl. space shown in attachment? Thanks Kim.
I think this is supposed to be 3.2 M3. 
nah, I didn't fix it just found that it appeared to be fixed.  Actually turns
out in comment #4 that it does not appear fixed, reopening to get rid of the
line of text below the image on Mac
I think I figured this one out.

There is a horizontal separator under the image that is two pixels high.  On the
mac the first pixel is white the second is dark.  On Windows it is the other way
around.

This gives the appearance of an extra white pixel under the image because the
text background on the right is also white so this blends in.

closing</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Due to the size of the text, removing the borders around the image has caused a white space to appear 
under the image.

kim, is this still happening on 3.2?  
It looks fine to me.
thanks kim

I believe this is happening when a build is happening. It is possible that the 
folder being tested is being deleted and recreated by another thread 
concurrently. Thus the NULL_FOLDER_SYNC is not present on the folder being 
tested. Another possibility is that a fluch of the CVS meta data is being done 
without holding the CVS sync lock. We shoudl have a look at the code to see if 
this is the case.
The most likely culprit appears to be the 
EclipseSynchronize#syncFilesChangedExternally which does a purge without 
obtaining the meta-data lock. I'm not sure why this would be happening for 
build cirectories though, since they do not contain CVS meta-data files.
I'm getting these regularly when I start synchronizing my workspace with CVS, and then start importing plugins as binary. I work with auto-build enabled, which usually rebuilds the workspace after importing plugins.
Markus, are you still seeing this?
Still happens. In N20060404-0010, I cleaned all projects and then started a CVS Workspace synchronization (autobuild on, autorefresh on, everything in background).

InternalPlatform.frameworkLog is set to null on shutdown.  This is another case
where behaviour of Platform API methods is undefined after runtime has shut
down.  If it's not possible to compute the log location after shutdown, I guess
we should throw IllegalStateException() to avoid the NPE.
John suggested that "Worker.run should check if the platform is shutdown and not
try to log".
Fine polish item.
CCing DJ for RC2 fix approval.

Steps to reproduce:
- Create Junit project
- Extract interface from TestFailure, using all methods

-&gt; One reference in DefaultFailureDetailView is not updated
Tobias, can you please investigate why ? Might be a candidate for 3.1
The search matches are grouped by compilation unit. If the first search match 
happens to be in an import declaration, this cu incorrectly is not considered 
for further processing
So why does it work then for other CUs. We almost always have an import
statement for the type. Tobias, please investigate for RC2. 

RC2 candidate. Depends on severity of the bug.
The problem mentioned in comment 2 has been fixed. There is however a more 
severe problem with the compiler loop over workingcopies.

Filed bug 97542 for this issue
Start verifying...
Verified by executing the refactoring and checking that only constructor
references to TestFailure are left in code.</WithStack>

The editor uses the info provided by the bindings. But moving to text to make sure.
I'm using the helper methods from JDT UI. Same problem with override decorator.
Martin, can you please have a look and move on the JDT/Core if we simply call
the methods on core. 
we're still using our homebrewed 'override' check. Markus, what are the latest
news on 'MethodBinding.overrides()' ?
No news lately. Methods IMethodBinding#overrides(..) and #isSubsignature(..) are
currently not used because they don't work across binding environments. However,
they're implemented and should work for bindings from one compiler loop, but
they have not been tested "in the field".
We should try to switch and use the jdt.core infrastructure here.
fixed &gt; 20050606
I've reverted the change in Bindings.findOverriddenMethodInType(..), since it
cause 4 failing TypeMismatchQuickFixTests. The old implementation did not check
return types, but IMethodBinding#overrides(..) does. 
not for 3.1. IMethodBinding.override is not yet used, its too late to start
testing this now.
Martin, we should investigate whether this can be fixed for 3.1.1. A similar bug
is 100233. We should either switch to the core method here (which results in
some fuzzyness we had regarding the return type) or add this case to the
Bindings implementation we have right now.
Martin, Markus can you please coordinate the fix for 97927 &amp; 100233. IMO they
will affect the same method(s) in class Bindings.
I suggest we do the fix as suggested in bug 100233. IMO, changing to
IMethodBinding.override for 3.1.1 is not an option.
Martin, I opt to mark this one as a dup of 100233 if we agree on fixing 100233
for 3.1.1.

I would expect detached stacked views to inherit the workspace settings of
rounded tabs on the top of the view.
Tried that. With the OS trim enabled, you end up seeing the title of the view
twice (once in the window title and once in the tab), which looks goofy when you
only have one tab. Might not be so bad if we continue to hide the tabs when
there's only one, though.

agree, we should honour the tab style and location and when there is only one
consider just not showing the tab.

    <WithStack>3.1 RC1 Candidate

Steps to reproduce:
- Create JUnit project
- Extract some portion of code from junit.swingui.AboutDialog
- Examine undo menu

-&gt; Menu entry is never entirely readable
-&gt; "Undo Extract 'method()'" would be enough

Note also the capitalization. There are also other refactorings with the same 
problem
Created attachment 21896
Screenshot
This is like this since day one. Not ciritical for 3.1. Deferring since fixing
this require new API in the commands framework.
.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I have a plugin project that uses EMF. At some point in its past, the JET build 
nature was added to it, so it appears in the .project file. But the "templates" 
directory and ".jetproperties" files are not checked in to CVS for my plugin.

The project just rolled forward to Eclipse M7, and now the build reports an 
error regarding my project: 

Errors during build.
  Errors running builder "JET Builder" on project org.eclipse.hyades.probekit.
  Resource /org.eclipse.hyades.probekit/templates does not exist.

Prior to the move up to M7, there were no build errors. My plugin hasn't 
changed: it never had a "templates" directory, and it has had the JET nature in 
the .project file for a long time.

This feels like a regression. It's possible that it's just a tightening of a 
requirement somewhere, but as a customer of EMF who has been building 
successfully all this time, it feels like a regression. I hope an EMF person 
can respond and explain the situation, and maybe look at the possibility of 
making the JET builder fail gracefully as it has in the past.
Allan,

After our conversation, I think it's clear that the best thing to do is to clean
up your .project file so that you don't have a jet nature or jet builder that
you don't want and need anyway...</WithStack>

    <WithStack>If I open the "Import Existing Projects" wizard then type in the first few
segments of the path I plan to browse, then select browse it fires off a long
search.  

This should not happen when browse is selected.
This is a tough one because loss of focus on the text widget causes the project 
list to update as a convenience for the user.  If there was no focus lost 
listener then you would have to hit the Refresh button if you were to type in a 
path.
I suggest that if focus is lost and the receiver of the focus is the browse
button then we don't refresh the list.
There are no plans to work on this currently</WithStack>

    <WithStack>At the earliest convenient opportunity, we should change 
StartupProgressMonitorDialog to have no trim. The change is to add to the 
constructor: setShellStyle(SWT.TOOL);
Sorry SWT.TOOL provides the thin shell trimming, not no trim.  However this bug
might be invalid if we try a solution where we keep the splash and float a very
simple progress window on top with no trim.
I said "no trim" when I meant "no title", sorry. I think the progress dialog 
should have a (thin) border, using SWT.NONE or SWT.TOOL. The former adds a one-
pixel black border, the latter adds a one-pixel black border with shadow.
Fixed the following in HEAD.
- removed trimmings
- remove about image 
- changed text in progress message from "Loading Plugins..." to "Starting
&lt;Product&gt;..."
- added a hidden parent shell to ensure the dialog does not show up as a top
level shell (e.g. in windows start bar)
- deleted some unused messages

- changed ChooseWorkspaceDialog to center on the monitor clientarea on startup
so that the two dialogs open in a similar fashion

logged bug 98176 against SWT for centering the splash on the monitor client area

- Launch JAR exporter on whole project
- Choose to export all output folders for the checked projects and all Java 
source files and resources
- Choose a jar file name which does not yet exist
- Press finish

-&gt; JAR exporter shows several warnings
-&gt; It seems that the two chosen options result in non-disjunct file sets, 
which are not properly merged before passing to the JAR writer
-&gt; In order to make the warnings useful, this case should not trigger warnings
Not critical for 3.1. Deferring...
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.

Mazen, though I don't have the 0510 build, I've self-hosted the latest eclipse 
with the swt plugin version that was in it.  This still gives me the same 
behaviour in the Intro pages, which is to flash quickly in the purple space at 
the top, approximately every 2-3 clicks, as I click between the Overview-
Tutorials-Samples-What's New items in the top-left corner of the Welcome.  The 
3.1M7 build, which is from 0513 (close to 0510) does the same.

Assuming that you still have the 0510 build available, can you confirm that you 
see something different than this?  And in 3.1M7?

Grant, I dont have the build anymore. I regret deleting it now.

In bug 84530 you mentioned that "...The new intro flashing is a result of the 
fix for bug 66813 and bug 81064."
Are you sure that there is nothing that can be done to eliminate this IE 
flicker? Regardless of previoius builds, anything that can be done from your 
side or my side? 
The flash mentioned in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=84530#c8 
was at a time when it was worse than it is now.

I've tried changing setText to set the page's content directly rather than 
doing so after Completing a Navigate to about:blank, and this did not help 
(strangely it became worse).  Adding NO_BACKGROUND styles, the typical fix for 
background flash, doesn't help either.  The IE control doesn't seem to offer 
api for influencing its rendering.  Will continue to look...

Closing report, the flicker has not been seen in the last 1.5 years.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I am using 3.1 M7. When I set to a shell.setImages() with an array of images

the window icon. It seems like the first image in the list with the 
appropriate resolution is selected (16*16) even though a higher color density 
image is later in the list and can be shown in the display. When I remove the 
lower color density one from the list, I see the correct one is selected.
Can you attach the images please?  Thanks.

Icon file with different icons of different size and depth

This sample can be used to see that not the optimal icon is taken by the shell.
Note that when the lower depth images are removed, the higher depth icons
display just fine
Sorry, not for 3.1.  You can work around the problem by using 
Display.getIconDepth() filter the list of icons before calling Shell.setIcons
().
I noticed that the Shell was taking a bigger Icon for the Top-Left window when
passing a list of Gif-Images to Shell#setImages, but when passing Png-Images
only 16x16 was used.

Ben
Ben, can you attach the list of images to this bug report?  The bug was not 
fixed for .ICO files that contain alpha but should be fixed for the other file 
formats.  The problem is that we can't detect Windows HICON's that have alpha 
and so don't prefer them on XP to HICON's without.
Ok, I think my suggestion was wrong. I checked the size by using Photoshop and
not my eyes and it turns out that both for PNG and GIF the 16x16px Image was
used, which is correct. The GIF image appeard bigger to me, but it is'nt.

Ben
We did fix this problem recently for everything but .ICO files.  The problem 
is that we lose the depth and alpha information when we create HICON's.  The 
non-ICO part of this bug was fixed for RC2 (see bug 98894).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I am using 3.1 M7. I added to a shell images using setImages(). The images 
were created from different sized icons with semi-transparent pixels in them. 
The icon on the window itself (top left) displays fine. However, when I 
ALT+TAB between the windows applications I see that the icon image displayed 
to select the active applications shows black instead of the semi-transparent 
pixels in the image. My guess is that SWT is not passing correctly the 
information to the OS in this case. The image itself looks fine on windows 
itself as an .ico file so I do not think this is a graphics issue.
Can you attach the images please?  Thanks.

I ain't sure I'm seeing the problem you described. Please, check the screenshot
I attached. Does it show the problem ?
That is how I loaded the image and set it in the shell:
Image icon = new Image (display, PR97046.class.getResourceAsStream
("sample2.ico"));
shell.setImage(icon);



Felipe, did you try multiple images using Shell.setImages()?  Have you tried 
both with and without the XP manifest?

Harry, is this what you are getting ?

Steve, yes, I tested all these scenarios.
Try to open sample2.ico using IE, does IE shows the icon wrong too ?
wrong == thick black border around the ballon.

To reproduce this problem I had to lower the depth of my display from 32bit to 
16bit (didn't test 24).
This fails on IE. The icon depth is more than the depth of display.
You can detect this case in your code using:
ImageData data = new ImageData (PR97050.class.getResourceAsStream
("sample2.ico"));
if (data.depth &gt; display.getIconDepth())  {
	System.out.println("BAD icon " +data.depth + " display only " +

I just won't close this bug cause I believe this can be fixed on Windows XP, 
but not in time for Eclipse 3.1

Related to run targets which have arguments.  I have an argument which consists
of a variable, whose name contains spaces:
${project_loc:project name here}/somefile

In the ant build file, it is output as:
&lt;arg value="${project_loc:project"/&gt;
&lt;arg value="name"/&gt;
&lt;arg value="here}/somefile"/&gt;

It would also need to insert the definition of the variable, as with classpath
variables.
Andrew is correc that there are two problems here:
 no expansion of the variables for program or vm arguments for all of the add*  
methods of BuildFileCreator

incorrect handling of strings with spaces in these arguments. 
BuildFileCreator.addElements(String, Document, Element, String, String) assumes 
that none of the values will contains strings.

Richard do you have time to work on these problems?
You are right, currently only working directory is expanded. (Was already a
TODO) And obviously I did not expect spaces... (Is now a TODO). I'm not sure if
I have time this weekend.
Created attachment 22390
Fixed source

Updated BuildFileCreator.addElements(String, Document, Element, String, String,
Map):
Uses org.apache.tools.ant.types.Commandline parser instead of StringTokenizer.
This also handles quoted arguments. 

BuildFileCreator.addVariable() now also supports several variables in one
command line argument.

Note: User should always double quote a command line argument if it contains
variables. If no double quotes are used by intention, because the variable
expands to two command line arguments, it is not possible to create a matching
Ant target: Nested &lt;arg&gt; can only contain one command line argument.
Thanks Richard.
Will review and consider for RC2
Richard...there is a problem with the quoting of variables in 
BuildFileCreator.addElements(String, Document, Element, String, String, Map)

Currently this code will fail with an argument such as:
"${project_loc} project name here"

I am leaning towards having reliance on the user to properly quote the 
arguments. What are your thoughts?
Darins, you are right. Remove the automatically inserted quotes. If there are
really unbalanced quotes, we should carry the error message back to the user.
For now I thinks it's okay to catch the exception. Sorry, somehow missed this
testcase.
Ok. I have altered the BuildFileCreator with Richard's patch and then modified 
to do error reporting on BuildExceptions from the Commandline usage.

Beefed up the error reporting in the AntBuildfileExportPage to report the 
exceptions to the user in the error message of the wizard.

Changes also to the DataTransferMessages and DataTransferMessages.properties 
for the NLS'ing
Please verify Ryan and Richard.
Darins, it works fine. Thanks.

This also handles quoted arguments. 

BuildFileCreator.addVariable() now also supports several variables in one
command line argument.

Note: User should always double quote a command line argument if it contains
variables. If no double quotes are used by intention, because the variable
expands to two command line arguments, it is not possible to create a matching
Ant target: Nested &lt;arg&gt; can only contain one command line argument.
Thanks Richard.
Will review and consider for RC2
Richard...there is a problem with the quoting of variables in 
BuildFileCreator.addElements(String, Document, Element, String, String, Map)

Currently this code will fail with an argument such as:
"${project_loc} project name here"

I am leaning towards having reliance on the user to properly quote the 
arguments. What are your thoughts?
Darins, you are right. Remove the automatically inserted quotes. If there are
really unbalanced quotes, we should carry the error message back to the user.
For now I thinks it's okay to catch the exception. Sorry, somehow missed this
testcase.
Ok. I have altered the BuildFileCreator with Richard's patch and then modified 
to do error reporting on BuildExceptions from the Commandline usage.

Beefed up the error reporting in the AntBuildfileExportPage to report the 
exceptions to the user in the error message of the wizard.

Changes also to the DataTransferMessages and DataTransferMessages.properties 
for the NLS'ing
Please verify Ryan and Richard.
Darins, it works fine. Thanks.
Marking verified.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>On non-Windows platforms, the dots look strange.  They don't match the 
platform look of a handle or grip.  Even on Windows, the theme can change the 
appearance of the dots in handles.  For example, the Windows "Gravity" theme 
uses lines rather than dotted lines.
Since there is no SWT widget available for a "grab" widget, perhaps we should
convert both the Welcome launcher and fast view bar to just a separator?
Separator does not indicate moveability, so we would loose the visual 
indication that you can drag the widget.
Personally, I thought it looked fine the way it was in 3.0.  It seems late in 
the game to be introducing changes like this.
Michael, I'll go with whatever you decide. The code shouldn't be too hard to tweak.

There is also the issue that when you have the perspective switcher and the fast
view bar docked together (the 2.1 arrangement) then the bar looks noisy:
perspective switcher -&gt; no border, fast view bar -&gt; border.

The appeal of the border is that in the empty case, i.e., when no fastviews are
docked then it is more obvious that there is an area to dock views, but I have
also heard the feedback that this looks like screen cheese. 

Therefore the suggestion from Michael in comment #1 is appealing to me.
Are we going to address this for 3.1 RC3?  If we leave it the way it is, it 
looks funny on most platforms.  If we put it back the way it was in 3.0, then 
we lose the moveability cue.  I'd rather lose the cue but if the decision is 
to leave it the way it is, let's close this bug as WONTFIX.
MVM and myself agreed to come up with a solution for RC3, so unless MVM 
changed his mind, we WILL address this to some extent.
At this point in time the proposed solution should be brought to the attention
of the PMC.

This change might impact the screenshots and people are starting to shoot them
during RC3. 
Only affects two shots in EPG. Advance notice would be good though so I can warn
the publisher of coming changes.
we should have an answer by tomorrow, please hold me to this&lt;grin&gt;
I always wondered why perspective switcher and dock view bar are not regular
toolbars? It is also frustrating that you can only dock them now into predefined
places and can't move around.

Same apply to the rest of toolbars. Why can't I stic toolbars to the left or
right gaps where perspective and quick view bars can be docked?

Speaking about UI, if you going to keep this line around quick view bar, please
make it look the same as perspective switcher bar. Currently there is no shadow
on windows for quick view bar.

By the way, there is no visual indication that perspective switcher can be
resized. It is not an issue in my view. I just think that old visual
representation (toolbar-like) for quick view bar was fine and consistent with
Windows UI.


+1 for comment #11.  UI is working towards this, there are some restrictions
with verical coolbars etc.. that we need to address first.

As a reference see also bug 97052.  It was created due to the inconsistancies as
opposed to the platform look so keeping this one open post 3.1 is the right
thing to do.
oops, I mean see also bug 97083

We're deprecating the FVB so no work is anticipated here...

BTW, the minimized stacks have their own 'border' affordance.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Our makefile system assumes that some variables are set, either in the

afoul of ifdefs that demand the setting.
Changing the make command or the make target to pass extra options works fine
for me (I tried a simple test using DEBUG=-g and my make file contains a ${DEBUG})
Did you try a makefile that uses one of these macros as part of an included 
file pathname? That's the particular case that failed for me. The parse 
process failed.

my test was with the following makefile with the resulting output from the

I have been running with the dynamic help window open as a dynamic view.  I have
noticed sometimes when switching views that the contents for the new active view
sometimes first appears with a grey background.  After a second or two it
redraws with a white background.  This looks a bit ugly.  I will attach a screen
shot from when it is in this state.  Here is one set of steps that reproduces it
for me (I don't know if all these steps are necessary - shutting down, and
tearing off the help view might not be necessary).

1) Setup a perspective with the Synchronize and CVS Repositories views in the
same tab group, with Synchronize on top.
2) Open the dynamic Help view and make it detached.
3) Shutdown and restartup
4) Wait until the Help view populates with the Sync view help
5) Click on the CVS Repositories view.

-&gt; The content appears with grey background, and then eventually redraws with white.

Screen shot of help view
If it matters, my default browser is Firefox 1.0.

Also, I just tried without detaching the Help view, and saw the same problem. So
it's unrelated to detached views.
The code that renders the view is from Eclipse Forms - pure SWT (nothing to do 
with the browser).
Not sure if this is related, but when I run a standalone help system in Firefox 
and my HTML documents do not have a background color set in their style, the 
topic pane shows gray. It looks like the same gray color as the help system UI 
frame.

I have not reported as it can be resolved by using a background color set to 
wihte (#FFFFFF) in the style sheet for the HTML topics, but it can be annoying. 
It only happens in Firefox. Mozilla and IE do not show it.

I'll attached some screen shots.

Attaching two jpegs. One is the standalone help system with Firefox with a 
topic where the topic HTML file has no background color assigned to its body 
tag (or style sheet).

The second is the standalone help system in Firefox with the same topic, but 
with bgcolor="#ffffff" added to its &lt;body&gt; tag.

In the first, you'll notice that the gray color looks like the same gray as the 
help system frame in which the buttons (Print, etc) are.

John, is this really Win2k (I also assume it is 3.1, not 3.0.2 as specified in 
the bug).
Yes, Win2k, build I20050527-1300.
Lee Anne, the gray we are talking about here is in the Help view, not in the 
browser. I suggest opening a separate defect for the browser gray.
I'm unable to reproduce, John are you still seeing this in Eclipse 3.3?
No, I can't reproduce in 3.3 RC4. I'm now using Firefox 2.0.4 on Windows XP.
Resolving as WORKSFORME, note also that the problem Lee Anne mentioned in comment 4 was fixed in Eclipse 3.3.</WithStack>

the debugger no longer is able to find the source for my java code.  I have
built the most simple java project and a single java class with just a main()

    <WithStack>We have not documented detached views. As they have qute a lot of features now
it is important that we discuss how to doc/undock etc.
Created attachment 23903
Patch to add documentation for detached views.
Created attachment 23904
Screenshot of detached view.

This screenshot could be made prettier by removing the area in the lower left
which does not belong to one of the two windows.
I have marked the documentation with the little "WIN" image.  It should really
be marked with "Linux GTK" too, but I did not find an image for Linux GTK.
related to bug 98965
Released &gt;20070613.

Committed in &gt;20070618. Changed the reference to the "Maximizing a view or editor" to reference the new docs ('gettingStarted/qs-39g' rather than the (now stale) 'tasks-3i' (this was added after I switched the other stuff over..).

The last build has already happened. Eric is this a requirement for a release or is it Ok if it waits until 3.3.1?
Eric, please double-check after we tagged the release and created the branch to make sure your change is not lost.  You might have to re-release the change into the branch depending on where we branch from.

StatusLineManager stm = ((WorkbenchWindow)HyadesUIPlugin.getInstance
().getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow()).getStatusLineManager();
BTW, do you know a way to get the StatusLineManager instance using a public 
class?
Use IStatusLineManager instead

You can get the StatusLineManager through the ActionBars on a view or editor 
part.
In your case, since the backgroudLoader is an utiliy class to populate the 
SDView, make this call :

IStatusLineManager lineManager = _view.getViewSite().getActionBars
().getStatusLineManager();

You can get the _view from passing it to the loader or getting the view in 
focus from the workspace

Dominique, can you try to solve this in 4.0 ? This is the only internal API we 
use in TPTP ( or the only one I could identify so far )I am upgrating the 
severity to major since any chage in the StatusLineManager can break our code.
Fixed in TPTP_HEAD for 4.0i4.

Do you mean in the topic tree, or just the file organization?
The platform doc describes the IDE platform, and hasn't been refactored to
support RCP subsetting.


So for 3.1, I'm fine with keeping the topic organization the same, but if we
want to factor the file organization to have RCP workbench vs. IDE, I'm OK with
that.

I mean the topic
Not fully sure what is going on here but if there are opportunities to have 
RCP related info called out in the doc, that would be great
All resource-specific topics are grouped together into a separate section of the TOC.  Doing any more would require spltting out separate RCP/IDE doc plugins.</WithStack>

John, what does the message about rules in the initial comment mean?
To reproduce, we really don't need any Java code.  Just a minimal project with 
all the .* files and the plugin.xml/build.properties files would o.
After some investigation, I believe that my repository, IBM CMVC, may have 
something to do with this problem. It seems to occur only when my plugin is 
shared with the IBM CMVC repository. If the error is not coming from Eclipse 
then it could be coming from the repository provider in which case I could 
puruse it with them. Otherwise, you need access to a CMVC repository in order 
to reproduce this.
Re comment #3.  See this link for an answer to the same question:

I need to write a FAQ for this...
Was able to reproduce with the Team sample pessimistic provider.
The scheduling rule passed to IProgressService#runInUI was causing the problem.
Fixed.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The IReportDescription interface has been deprecated and replaced by

ReportDescription is still using the deprecated interface; it should be updated 
to work with the new class
As a comment, I find this deprecation unusual.. if I have a class A which 
implements the IReportGenerator interface and also extends my own class B, 
there is no easy way I can remove the deprecation and move A to extend the 
ReportGeneratorWizard class. I have to choose between my B class and the new 
class provided by the TPTP framework
We should at least remove the deprecated call from the TPTP code so other users 
have a sample on how to update their code.
Assigning to Dominique since Joe is on vacation ( I see that Dominique had 
changed the code and deprecated that interface )
EM: the IReportDescription has been replaced by the abstract class 
ReportGeneratorWizard in the class

    <WithStack>Enter more than one line of text in the site.xml editor.  Either save, resize or
stretch the editor.  The String within the Text widget is forced to a single
line and stretched horizontally.

We are experiencing this problem with our RCP application when placing a Text
widget with WRAP | V_SCROLL style bits within a ScrolledForm.  Both Text and
StyledText widgets share the same odd behavior.
Are you entering this line in the source page or the GUI page?
(In reply to comment #1)
&gt; Are you entering this line in the source page or the GUI page?

I entered into the GUI page.  If you enter into the source page then you get the
same results.  If entered into the GUI as I did you can visually see the funky
behavior by stretching or expanding the editor - or by saving the editor.  I
think this is a bug when wordwrap enabled Text widgets are placed in a ScrolledForm.
But the source page is not in a scrolled form, and you say that you get the 
same result.
(In reply to comment #3)
&gt; But the source page is not in a scrolled form, and you say that you get the 
&gt; same result.

I appologize - the form I am referring to is on the "Archives" tab of the
site.xml editor.
This is most likely a PDE issue - need to assign width hint for the text 
widget to prevent it from stretching as wide as needed to show the text in one 
line.
Fixed.
Not fixed - scrollbars were only removed.  Now I cannot see all my text.
also - when I save after adding text it does not wrap or scroll my text, it
expands horizontally onto a single line (See original description).
This is a more general problem than just the site.xml editor.  All of our RCP
application's ScrolledForms blow out the horizontal size of Text widgets that
contain very long lines of text.  It seems that the Text is being horizontally
sized to accomodate the entire line even when you specify SWT.WRAP or
SWT.H_SCROLL.  This defeats the entire purpose of using scrollbars.  Removing
the scrollbars is not an option for our users.

Set to Blocker because it blocks us from using Scrollbars.
This is really a problem for our RCP app.  Is there a workaround for this bug?
When you specify Text widget, do you use SWT.MULTI style as well? Without it, you will always get one line of text (text field). In those cases, the recommended way to deal with long strings is to set the minimum/preferred size of the widget so something small (say, 100). This will render the widget nicely with respect to the overall page. It WILL cut off the text but you can still read the entire text - just click in the field and move the cursor to the right using the right arrow key.

If, on the other hand, you want the entire text to be visible, you need to create a Text widget with SWT.MULTI style and use SWT.WRAP.

Since we are wrapping up 3.2, either reduce the severity of the defect or let us know if the suggestions above work for you.
Reducing severity to normal due to the age of the bug and the definition of 'blocker' severity.
Reproduced on 3.4 RC3. Using SWT.WRAP | SWT.MULTI still does not cause the text to wrap. I had to add a widthHint to the Text to force it use multiple lines and wrap. This is not ideal as it requires you to know the desired width at development time.
See the discussion in Bug 265389, I think this is the same problem but since I'm not 100% sure of that I will not close either bug out as a duplicate.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I've been asked to provide a demo of using buttons for toggling views between
detached, fast view, and docked.

This PR is intended for tracking the state of the patch and discussing the
merits of the feature.
Created attachment 21907
Rough demo (patch for workbench)

This patch implements a rough demo of the feature. Not production quality yet.

Behavioral changes:
- Adds system icons for detaching, creating fast views, and docking.
- Changes the system menu to match the toolbar buttons (they get matching icons
and are no longer toggles. For example, detached views have "fast view" and
"attach" items rather than a checked "detached" item that moves the view to its
previous location)
- The new icons are aligned with the view menu.

API changes:
- Three new constants in IWorkbenchPartConstants (not sure if this is the best
place for them or not)
- IStackPresentationSite gets property change listeners (with selection and
disposed events)
- IStackPresentationSite gets the following:

public boolean canMoveTo(IPresentablePart part, int location);
public void moveTo(IPresentablePart part, int location)
public int getLocation();

- There needs to be a protocol for presentations to hide the old system menu
actions for detaching and fast views
Known bugs:
- There are several layout problems (the toolbar will sometimes end up missing
or in the wrong spot).
- The icons are wrong (I just grabbed random icons)

IWorkbenchPartConstants is for properties on regular views and editors.  Should
put the new constants in the presentations API, presumably close to where the
min and max constants are.


Nick: I agree that this might not be the best place for the constants, but they
are much more useful than just for the presentation API. Universal constants for
docking locations would also be useful for IWorkbenchPage, IPageLayout, and any
other workbench class that currently distinguishes between fast/detached/docked.
These states are not currently exposed to regular plug-ins.
But if you think there's a good chance they may be in the future, I'm OK with it.

My analysis of the new feature. First the quick version:

Pros:
1. Makes it more obvious how to reattach a detached view
2. Makes it more efficient to create a fast view / detached view
3. Makes it easier to discover fast views and detached views

Cons:
4. Makes it harder to discover the view menu
5. Adds visual clutter
6. Makes it easier to change states by accident
7. Uses extra screen real-estate

Suggestions:
8. Keep the view menu next to the new location icons
9. Do not change the fast view icon based on the location of the fast view bar.
10. Provide a faster gesture for reattaching a view from the fast view bar.

Summary:
11. Make this feature avalable as an option, but disable it by default.
12. Keep the new API, even if we don't use the new icons.
13. Wait until 3.2 before adding this patch.
14. Keep the reattach button for detached views.


Now the long version:

1. With the current detached view appearance, it is not easy to tell how to
reattach views. The patch greatly improves this issue, which justifies (at
minimum) including the reattach button for detached views (item 14).


2. The buttons make it significantly quicker to create fast views and detached

initially get the layout the way they like it and then infrequently tweak views
between the three states. However, this is probably not true of all users and
those that are continually tweaking their layout would find it useful. 

This would justify including the new buttons (at least) as an option for
power-users (item 11).

(Aside: Since I'm the guy who wrote the current workbench layout, fast view bar,
and detached view code, I am continually rearranging my layout for testing.
However, I believe that I am a minority and that most users do not rearrange
their layout frequently).

Re: comment 5

I agree they should move. Do we have any other repository for workbench
constants? I'd like to avoid creating yet another class (classloading is already
slow enough), but agree that they don't really fit in where they are.

Screenshot including a docked view, a detached view, and a fast view

Screenshot of the new buttons (the location and function is correct, but the
actual icons will change).
We have the constants for max/min/restore on IStackPresentationSite.
Although the location is per-part state, not stack state, the API to
query/change locations is on IStackPresentationSite, so how about just adding
the constants there?

Also noticed that some of the new API is missing @since tags.

is only one meaning for Make Fast View, and once the user has learned to
recognize its icon, we shouldn't change it on them just because the fast view
bar moved. I haven't had time to code the changing icons yet, but would advise
against it in any case.


10. Now that there is a fast gesture to create a fast view, there should be an
equally fast gesture to undo that action. I would suggest allowing users to
re-dock fast views by double-clicking on the fast view's icon. Nick suggested
also removing the current ability to hide the view by clicking on an open fast
view's icon to avoid introducing temporal modes. This gesture is redundant
anyway since the user can also hide the fast view by clicking virtually anywhere
else on the window.


Summary:

11. I believe this is a potentally useful feature for certain experienced users,
but it will be intimidating to new users. As such, I recommend including as an
option but disabling by default.


12. The new API gives presentations control over the fast view creation gesture.
This is useful for RCP and we should keep it even if we decide not to use it
ourselves.


13. The patch is big and risky (getting the layout right is really tricky). This
is also the type of thing we should gather some community feedback on before
including it in a major release. I'd suggest deferring until early in 3.2.

Re: comment 5

I agree they should move. Do we have any other repository for workbench
constants? I'd like to avoid creating yet another class (classloading is already
slow enough), but agree that they don't really fit in where they are.

Created attachment 21914
Screenshot including a docked view, a detached view, and a fast view

Screenshot of the new buttons (the location and function is correct, but the
actual icons will change).
We have the constants for max/min/restore on IStackPresentationSite.
Although the location is per-part state, not stack state, the API to
query/change locations is on IStackPresentationSite, so how about just adding
the constants there?

Also noticed that some of the new API is missing @since tags.

The doc for fast views is out of date as it mentions only the horizontal tool
bar which can now be moved around
This needs to be resolved for 3.1.

833: For files with a "833" error, correct the meta tag in the file to the 
following:
 &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;

841: For files with a "841" error, a FONT or FONT-FAMILY attribute has been 
found in a STYLE section and the attribute hardcodes the name of one or 
more font face names. These fonts may be hard to reproduce in a non-English
environment. A CSS should be used instead.

920: For files with a "920" error, add one of the following comments to the file
to indicate what type of single quote handling should be used:
# NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_ALL 
# NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_NONE
# NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR
Choose which comment to use based on this criteria:
NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_ALL
    Each string is assumed to be processed by the java.text.MessageFormat class
(single quote must be coded as 2 consecutive single quotes ''). 
NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_NONE
    All strings are assumed to NOT be processed by the java.text.MessageFormat
class (single quote must be coded as 1 single quote '). 
NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR
    Strings which contain replacement variables are processed by the
MessageFormat class (single quote must be coded as 2 consecutive single quotes
''). Strings which do NOT contain replacement variables are NOT processed by the
MessageFormat class (single quote must be coded as 1 single quote ').


955: For files with a "955" error, an XML element (e.g. &lt;br&gt;) has an extra
terminating element (e.g. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;). Remove the extra element.

957: For files with a "957" error, an XML element (e.g. &lt;br&gt;) is missing a
terminating element (e.g. &lt;/br&gt;). To correct the problem, either remove an
unneeded element or add the matching terminating element.

980: For files with a "980" error, an HTML element has been found which uses 
uppercase letters. Locate the listed line number in the XHTML file, find
the element and change it to lowercase letters. For example, change 
"&lt;META&gt;" to "&lt;meta&gt;".

955: For files with a "955" error, an XML element (e.g. &lt;br&gt;) has an extra
terminating element (e.g. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;). Remove the extra element.

957: For files with a "957" error, an XML element (e.g. &lt;br&gt;) is missing a
terminating element (e.g. &lt;/br&gt;). To correct the problem, either remove an
unneeded element or add the matching terminating element.

980: For files with a "980" error, an HTML element has been found which uses 
uppercase letters. Locate the listed line number in the XHTML file, find
the element and change it to lowercase letters. For example, change 
"&lt;META&gt;" to "&lt;meta&gt;".

update operation failed pop-up window

could you guys(Dejan, Dorian, Konrad) check it, it happens with
http://update.eclipse.org/testUpdates/ (choose last category) this is slow so
you can test it with site created by you just delete plug-in jar. Without patch
it should stop without any worning and with patch there should be a pop-up
window informing you that update operation has failed. I think this is very
important for user experience, since when originally happened to me i was very
confused. There is no risk that i could see, so I think it is very safe patch.
the patch looks ok... has it been tested on regular install, automatic updates 
and scan for updates (in config manager window) ?

The patch constains changes to ReviewPage.  How they relate to this bug?

The change to InstallWizard2 is OK (except unused import).  It produces a 
simple mesage dialog - better than nothing.

During tesing i disconnected the network and was presented with a different 
error dialog.  So some code is already there to report an error, but does not 
cover all failure scenarios.  The new dialog shows up when features do not 
exist.  It would be best to consolidate these dialogs.  But for 3.1  I think 
this is fine.
+1.  provided I read some explanation of changes to ReviewPage.

Dorian,
i tested for regular install as for scan for updates it's exaclty the same code
path as regular install so i do not see any reason to test in that set up. Do
you see any problems with other scenarios or you would just like to me tested
more?
Konrad,
you are right that's half a fix for another bug(gone now).
no, I don't anticipate any problems, but at this point in time we need to get 
a good test coverage, and those would be the main execution paths.
Now is the perfect time to be paranoid and test even though you know the code 
uses the same branches.
+1.  For the code in the patch.
Branko, Please perform more testing to obtain +1 from component owner.
finally i tested it and it worked from update manager and automatic updates
thanks Branko!

+1 for RC3
Released.
Looks like the map made in into 4pm build. :-)</WithStack>

Linux/GTK implementation of table column can be easily made multiline inserting

Windows implementation for this would be very tricky. In Win32 programming
people either replace table control or table header control to get this
functionality or create all kind of tricks to full ListView32 window to allow
multiliner. I did a quick research for this Win32 problem and did not see any
easy solution. I don't expect it to be solved any time soon.

    <WithStack>Using the DOM Indexer with a C Project:

// test.h:
int x;
// test.c:
int foo() {
  return x; // F2 on x should highlight x in test.h and not the x in test.c
}
External variables are no longer supported.

However there is still a problem with external functions.

// test.h:
int x() {return 1;}
// test.c:
int f() {return x();} // F2/F3 on x should find the x in test.h

DOM Indexer: F2 fails, F3 works
Original Indexer: F2 fails, F3 works
CTags Indexer: F2 works, F3 fails

Moving to RC1 since depending PR is moved to RC1.
This is still on M7, not RC1.
Second example with DOM indexer now yields:
F2 works, F3 fails

I would say that this is correct behaviour and we should rethink what F3 (open
declaration) means in C/C++ world. Opening a definition (F2) is what makes
sense, since there could be multiple declarations but only one definition of an
element.


To do it properly:

Open Declaration will do a search on both declarations and definitions. If it
finds more than one occurrence it shall bring up a dialog for the user to choose
which one s/he wants.
Open Declaration/Open Definition are not meant to bring up dialogs.
The gesture is meant to go to the AST construct that makes the most sense.  If
there are multiple declarations then the Open Declaration Action (not the
indexer) picks the one that it thinks fits best. 
Throwing up a dialog interferes with the workflow.

So is this bug still open or is there a new bug?
That's OK for Open Definition, not so good for Open Declaration. Why is picking
the first item returned in the list the "right" item?
In general the first item found is returned (which should be the first 
declaration).  This may not be the best choice all of the time but unless 
someone complains about it with a good reason then that's the way it is.  It's 
a bad idea to open a dialog for the quick 'jump to' features F2/F3 since the 
user can use Search or All Declarations to get a list of the results if F2/F3 
isn't the one they wanted.



This bug isn't fixed ... but for the purpose of closing M7 it might be best to 
push it aside (or move it to RC1 anyways) since I don't consider it to be a 
show stopper.  

When I create a new Standard Make C Project the DOM Indexer doesn't seem to 
run.  I try to build the project but no #includes are picked up, and the DOM 
Indexer still doesn't run.

I just tried the latest from HEAD with the following results:

// test.h:
int x() {return 1;}
// test.c:
int f() {return x();} // F2/F3 on x should find the x in test.h

DOM Indexer: F2 fails, F3 fails
CTags Indexer: F2 fails, F3 fails

Ok, the behaviour you see is the matter of facts.
The reason is as follows:
When a new standard make project is created default value for indexer is 'Full
indexer' aka DOM indexer. Also default for SCD is 'Per file discovery'. In this
case building a project without a proper make file will not yield any discovered
info, therefore the indexer will skip all files that do not have any scanner
info (which is all files in this case).

To be able to exercise the test case, please switch to 'Per project discovery'
before building the project.</WithStack>

someone complains about it with a good reason then that's the way it is.  It's 
a bad idea to open a dialog for the quick 'jump to' features F2/F3 since the 
user can use Search or All Declarations to get a list of the results if F2/F3 
isn't the one they wanted.



This bug isn't fixed ... but for the purpose of closing M7 it might be best to 
push it aside (or move it to RC1 anyways) since I don't consider it to be a 
show stopper.  

When I create a new Standard Make C Project the DOM Indexer doesn't seem to 
run.  I try to build the project but no #includes are picked up, and the DOM 
Indexer still doesn't run.

I just tried the latest from HEAD with the following results:

// test.h:
int x() {return 1;}
// test.c:
int f() {return x();} // F2/F3 on x should find the x in test.h

DOM Indexer: F2 fails, F3 fails
CTags Indexer: F2 fails, F3 fails

Ok, the behaviour you see is the matter of facts.
The reason is as follows:
When a new standard make project is created default value for indexer is 'Full
indexer' aka DOM indexer. Also default for SCD is 'Per file discovery'. In this
case building a project without a proper make file will not yield any discovered
info, therefore the indexer will skip all files that do not have any scanner
info (which is all files in this case).

To be able to exercise the test case, please switch to 'Per project discovery'
before building the project.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>Does this have to be done?  I know what it is doing.  I don't need the
plugin.xml open.  Also, it seems to force a build.  I want to do a full build
after I've turned all my natures on.  This runs much faster than a, then b, then
c all running when I select several projects at once and turn things on.
Yes, opening the plugin.xml in the editor is undesirable - it is just a
side-effect of the way we add the org.aspectj.runtime dependency. We'll see if
there is a way to add it without opening the editor.

I guess a build should be forced if "build automatically" is on, but it
shouldn't if this is off. Are you seeing forced builds even when "build
automatically" is off?
I'm fairly sure this needs to be done.  We definitely want to avoid having to do anything like parsing the plugin.xml file.  However I have not looked into it in that much depth so I'm returning it to the pool for now.
Do we open still open plugin.xml when adding AspectJ nature?
Yes, the manifest editor is being opened automatically whenever the AJ nature is added or removed from a plugin project.  I will be attaching a patch that will automatically close the editor after the AJ nature has been added or removed (if it was not already opened before the operation started).  This will mean that the programmer will see a flicker of the editor opening and then closing, but it seems that it is necessary for the editor to be opened in order to ensure consistency when the required plugins are changed.

As for builds, it does not seem that a build is being forced even when automatic builds are turned off.  If automatic builds are turned on, then it seems entirely reasonable that a full build is required after adding or removing the AJ nature.  So, I am not touching this part.

With this patch, the manifest editor will be closed immediately after adding or removing AJ Nature (if it wasn't already open beforehand).

Looks like you're including IDE plug-ins that make assumptions about the menu
structure.  Do you include org.eclipse.ui.editors?  

For the CheatSheetHelpMenuAction, this appears to be coming from
org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets itself.  It should not make assumptions about the
menu structure, since cheatsheets is intended to be an optional RCP component.

Here is my required plugins:
   &lt;requires&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.core.runtime"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.swt"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.formulachess.chess.utils"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.jface"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.formulachess.chess.ui"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.ui.workbench"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.ui.views"/&gt;
   &lt;/requires&gt;

I don't know what to change to get rid of these.
My point was that in the past this used to work without errors. Also I lost the
icon when I run in self-hosting.
The update.ui.* and org.eclipse.ui.actions.showKeyAssistHandler come from
org.eclipse.ui.ide, which should also not be included in RCP apps.

You should include org.eclipse.ui instead of org.eclipse.ui.workbench.
It re-exports SWT, JFace and ui.workbench, so the following should suffice:

   &lt;requires&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.core.runtime"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.formulachess.chess.utils"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.formulachess.chess.ui"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.ui"/&gt;
      &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.ui.views"/&gt;
   &lt;/requires&gt;

But I suspect the problem is with the launch config, not your plugin.xml.
On the plug-ins tab, press Deselect All, select your chess plug-ins, then Add
Required and try Validate Plug-in Set.


You are right. Your suggested change reduced the list.
But I still get:
Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid):
org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.actions.CheatSheetHelpMenuAction

And I don't see the icon.
The remaining error was apparently due to a stale config.
Cleaning the target's config fixed the problem.

Lorne, please consider this for RC2.
See comment 1 for the problem.  I suggest moving the action set to the ide plug-in.


Actually, it might make more sense to put the action set in the SDK plug-in, not
o.e.ui.ide.

CheatSheetHelpMenuAction is internal 
(org.eclipse.ui.internal.cheatsheets.actions.CheatSheetHelpMenuAction). The 
action's implementation is trivial and it would be easy to move it to 
org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets as API, but we would need approval for it.

If approved, I would:

1) Move the class 'CheatSheetHelpMenuAction' to org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets 
package and add all the required Javadoc to make it real API.

2) Move Cheatsheet action set to org.eclipse.platform plugin.xml.

Note that if you want to expose the action without exposing its implementation
class, you can use the extension factory mechanism.  See
org.eclipse.core.runtime.IExecutableExtensionFactory,
org.eclipse.ui.ExtensionFactory, and how it's used in org.eclipse.ui.ide's
plugin.xml.

This would still require an API exemption to provide a cheat sheets extension
factory as API.

Jim, request for API exception:

- We need to expose cheat sheet action via an extension factory.
- We will use the factory to contribute the action set in org.eclipse.sdk 
plugin.xml
- Other products will be able to do the same, but we will not add the action 
set for free for all the people that simply add the cheat sheets plug-in into 
their RCP.

The proposed API:

org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.CheatSheetExtensionFactory

It will implement IExecutableExtensionFactory and used for the action set in 
the following way:

   &lt;extension

The minimized intro and the fast view bar both have drag/grab bars on the
top/left side of them.  These bars are drawn as dotted lines, essentially. 
However, they are drawn differently.  This is particularly noticeable if they
are placed next to each other.
In this corner hailing from T Dot, wearing the red trunks, I give you.... DEJAN THE DESTROYER!

The the other corner hailing from sunny Ottawa, wearing the blue trunks, I gice you... BOXCAR STEFAN!

Let me introduce the referee for this bout - Michael "The Breeder" Van Meekeren.

This fight will be to 10 rounds, with each round lasting 2 minutes.  

GO!

 

Personally, I would rather use the CoolBar and let it render the handle any 
way it wonts. I got it close to working but had to back out because CoolBar 
does not support vertical orientation (there is a feature request against SWT).

I think CoolBar would give us a portable solution becuase its dragger would be 
native-friendly.

Now, whose idea was that I need to wear these hedious red trunks :-)? They 
make me look fat.
I agree that a native dragger would be better... and synchronizing our algorithm
would be the next-best choice.

I based my code on the IntroBar, but changed the appearance slightly to ensure
that the margins were symmetrical. We should probably go with whatever looks
closest to the coolbar-with-xp-manifest look.

So we can track this, dejans bug for coolbars supporting vertical is Bug 92013.

Since it is not going to happen for 3.1, our options are make both dotted lines
the same with the same spacing or go with a separator.  Linda was going to
propose a common spacing solution, Linda?  I could not find a bug logged by you
so why not comment here?

I suggest we either 1) stick with the dotted line until 92013 is fixed OR 2)
remove the feature and just use a cursor change (as in the curve on the top
right for the perspective switching bar) to show this feature.  I'm not sure
that dragging it around is all that important and while it should be possible
most people will probably leave it where it is.

We can do the following:

1) Use the same algorithm to render grab bars so that there is no difference 
between fast views and Intro

2) Render the grab bars only on Windows. This way, we will look polished on 
Windows while avoiding the non-native look on other platforms.
Even on windows, the grab bars are themeable and we can't always get it right.
IIRC, the 3.0/3.1 look is supposed to look "less busy" than the R21 look (that
was one of the reasons for changing it). So to keep that spirit would mean
removing that box around the fast view bar and intro bar, remove the dotted
drags, and remove the little x close icon on the intro bar. All these appeared
in a recent RC so they should be easy to back out.
minimally for RC4 we should make the two gripper areas and layout wrt spacing
the same for the fastview and welcome bars.

to be reviewed June 21
approved for RC4
Will do.
Assigning to intro for now because intro launch bar needs to be adjusted.
Tweaked intro launch bar grab handle to look like the fast view bar handle. 
Also swapped the location of the 'close' button relative to the grab handle.

patch to workbench

Dejan here is what I was planning for the fastview bar to tighten it up.  I
will load your code from head to see if they are different still.
I would be very surprised if they are. Let me know when you are done so that I 
can catch up.

Dejan please copy this , I'm testing this patch on other platforms now
Dejan,  please hold off and copying this till tomorrow.  I found some issues on
other platforms that I need to investigate.  
Actually now that I have had some sleep and looked at this again.  I think we
should just leave it as it is now that Intro matches the fast view bar.  There
is a decent amount of space on the side of the gripper that could be tightened
up but this also gives more affordance when trying to grab it and move it and it
turns out when the fast view bar is empty and shrinks down to the thin bar it is
important to have a few extra pixels on the sides of the gripper.


I amd marking this as FIXED for RC4, thanks Dejan.
That was my sentiment too - I was surprised that you wanted to further play 
with it. You need some margin around the grab bar, otherwise it becomes 
difficult for mouse-challenged users.
Actually you only assigned it - I am marking it fixed now :-).</WithStack>

    <WithStack>When opening a file.genmodel and clicking "Generate Model Code", the code
generator overrides the project's build path, thus destroying other dependencies.

Here is a simple example:
1) I have generated some code from the model.
2) I create a junit test-case class to test some things with my model. When
creating the test-case class, eclipses adds junit.jar to the project's build path.
3) I find that there is something wrong with my model, so I change it and
regenerate the code.
4) The code generator overrides the project's build path, thus removing
junit.jar from it. Now my test-case class doesn't compile.

It frustrates me that I need to add junit.jar everytime, or that I need to have
my test classes in another project. I don't see why EMF needs to override the
project's build path.
To the best of my knowledge, EMF requires some jar files in the project's build
path so the project can be deployed as an eclipse plugin. However, this can be
achieved by *appending* those jar files to the build path instead of completely
overriding it.

Thanks,

Johnathan,

EMF generates a plugin specifically for writing JUnits so it seems best to
create your JUnit there.  In any event, the GenModel also has a property "Update
Classpath" that you can set to false to turn off the behavior you don't like.  

The newsgroup is a good place to raise issues like this...</WithStack>

path so the project can be deployed as an eclipse plugin. However, this can be
achieved by *appending* those jar files to the build path instead of completely
overriding it.

Thanks,

Jonathan
Johnathan,

EMF generates a plugin specifically for writing JUnits so it seems best to
create your JUnit there.  In any event, the GenModel also has a property "Update
Classpath" that you can set to false to turn off the behavior you don't like.

    <WithStack>I'm using PDE builder in 3.1 M7 driver to do the headless build of our product.
I got error messages saying 
org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Unable to find plug-in: 
com.ibm.xxx.xxx.nl1_2.0.0. Please check the error log for more details.
The same product was able to be built under M6.
Any more details in the .log file?
The .log file could not be found in the workspace. 
So nothing is in 
Window&gt;Show View&gt;Other&gt;PDE Runtime&gt;Error Log
related to this problem?
Created attachment 21958
Build log

This is the log generated during the build. I'm sorry that I didn't look for it
at the right place.
I know nothing about your PDE build configuration but it would appear that 
either com.ibm.etools.zos.subsystem.uss.nl1_3.0.0 is missing or a dependancy 
of this plugin is missing.

Nothing has changed in your build except for moving from M6 to M7?
This is a quite simple case. There is a feature which contains the plugin and 
another nl feature which contains the nl fragment. 
There is no change to the product itself. The only change is moving from m6 to 
m7. The fragment itself was checked out from cvs in the same build as well as 
the plugin. The plugin can be built without a problem. 
Since your scenario is simple, could you please provide us with a reproduceable
test case. Note that we don't need any code, the various manifests and the
build.properties are sufficient.
Created attachment 22087
testcase

Here you are.
The attached test case is incomplete. It does not contain all the necessary
prerequisites. 
The same problem should occur in the workspace.
It used to build well in m6. Can you please tell me what's missing? Thanks
com.ibm.etools.systems.core is the first one that I encountered (required from subsystem.uss), but I 
also noticed that at leat both systems.universal and com.ibm.etools.zseries.util are also missing.
Please make sure that all the appropriate plugins are provided, or even better try to provide a simpler 
test case. Thx.

com.ibm.etools.zseries.util is in the testcase I sent you. Would you please 
check it again? com.ibm.etools.systems.core and systems.universal are in the 
baseLocation. If I skip the language fragment feature, I can build my main 
feature without problem, which means all the dependencies are there I guess. 
The example was incomplete, but after bashing multiple plugin.xml I noticed that 
some of your fragments are incorrect: the plugin say it is 3.0, and the fragment
is for 2.1. This a dup of #98593.

!MESSAGE com [in /lib/weblogic.jar [in process-server]] does not exist
Do you still experience this error with RC1?

I haven't been able to upgrade yet. Its simpler for me to keep the same 
version on my eclipse ide as the one we use for our product, and we're having 
blocking issues with RC1 so I cannot upgrade yet. I've also tried to take the 
massive weblogic.jar out of my build classpath, and so far that might have 
helped. 
 
I've noticed a couple of other things that happen when this happens. My import 
list has various randing errors on imports that should be valid (like 
org.eclipse.ui.view will be marked red as Eclipse cannot find it). It is like 
the jobs that keep the models (I forget what their called) behind the scene 
just dies and doesn't wake up again.. But I see no errors or exceptions 
besides the ones pasted in here. 
 
Hopefully I can upgrade to RC2 and see if that fixes it. It is annoying, but a 
restart of the IDE fixes it (at least temporary). 
This just happened again on RC3 after not happening for a long time. 
 
It seems to be happening as soon as the "weblogic.jar" is in the build path of 
any project. I just added a new project and happened to add weblogic.jar as a 
library to it, and 10-15 minutes later this happened again.  
 
But as long as I keep this one out, it works fine. It is either something 
inside the weblogic.jar causing this or its size is just too big alltogether 
(30mb). I'm taking it out again, but this might be an issue if people are using 
Eclipse for weblogic specific development. 
I don't find a test case to reproduce the bug.

I close as REMIND this bug. If you can reproduce the bug with a recent build, please reopen this bug.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Since M7, I've had problems with code completion stoping to work from time to time.

!MESSAGE com [in /lib/weblogic.jar [in process-server]] does not exist
Do you still experience this error with RC1?

I haven't been able to upgrade yet. Its simpler for me to keep the same 
version on my eclipse ide as the one we use for our product, and we're having 
blocking issues with RC1 so I cannot upgrade yet. I've also tried to take the 
massive weblogic.jar out of my build classpath, and so far that might have 
helped. 
 
I've noticed a couple of other things that happen when this happens. My import 
list has various randing errors on imports that should be valid (like 
org.eclipse.ui.view will be marked red as Eclipse cannot find it). It is like 
the jobs that keep the models (I forget what their called) behind the scene 
just dies and doesn't wake up again.. But I see no errors or exceptions 
besides the ones pasted in here. 
 
Hopefully I can upgrade to RC2 and see if that fixes it. It is annoying, but a 
restart of the IDE fixes it (at least temporary). 
This just happened again on RC3 after not happening for a long time. 
 
It seems to be happening as soon as the "weblogic.jar" is in the build path of 
any project. I just added a new project and happened to add weblogic.jar as a 
library to it, and 10-15 minutes later this happened again.  
 
But as long as I keep this one out, it works fine. It is either something 
inside the weblogic.jar causing this or its size is just too big alltogether 
(30mb). I'm taking it out again, but this might be an issue if people are using 
Eclipse for weblogic specific development. 
I don't find a test case to reproduce the bug.

I close as REMIND this bug. If you can reproduce the bug with a recent build, please reopen this bug.
As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>As far as I know, a partial patch has to be installed as unpacked.  If the 
original plug-in was not unpacked, was running from a jar, the patch is 
installed correctly, but does not run.
This is because jarred plug-ins with manifest.mf and some code have different 
classpath, are built differently, and are not simply jarred versions of 
unjarred plug-ins.

That makes delivering a small patch to a jarred plug-in complicated because it 
requires more changes to the plug-in and more testing.
Konrad, is this something that can be fixed in rc2? you did some work on this 
earlier.
We did not think it will be significant limition, at the time so I have not 
investigated how much it would take for implementation to add files to 
existing jar, to allowed jarred partial patch.
It is not critical for 3.1, but I think it would be good to fix for RC2.
Branko, see if it is something safely doable in a couple of days.
This is a mass update of Platform Update bugs that have had no activity in three years. Platform Update was replaced in Eclipse 3.4 (2008) by a new provisioning system called Equinox p2. If this bug or enhancement is not already addressed in p2 please enter a new bug report against p2 (RT &gt; Equinox &gt; p2). If you still want to see this bug addressed in the deprecated Platform Update component, please reopen this bug. Patches welcome.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Whenever I step through source code in a webapp, the debugger doesn't highlight
the code nor does it step to any source files that are outside of the entry
point file.

I'm using Tomcat 5.5.9 that is started with the Sysdeo Tomcat plugin.  The
problem wasn't present until 3.1m6.

Shot of the debugger in action with no highlighted source
Created attachment 21916
Shot of my debug pointer options to show that text highlighting is turned on
Does the problem occurr in 3.1RC1?
Problem still occurs in 3.1RC1.
Need steps/sample application to reproduce.
As well, it would be helpful if you could re-test on RC3.
Problem still occurs in 3.1rc4

Steps to reproduce.
Note: I'm using the Sysdeo plugin to start Tomcat within Eclipse.  This allows
me to easily attach to Tomcat for debugging.
1. Start Tomcat in Eclipse
2. Set a breakpoint in a Java file that is accessed (e.g. Struts Action class)
3. Access a page that calls the action with the breakpoint.

Results: the debug view shows the correct line of code being debugged but the
file with the breakpoint is not brought into the foreground view.  When I switch
over the file, the line being debugged is not highlighted.
Could be a problem with sysdeo - needs investigation. Does the problem happen 
when debugging a stand alone Java App?
I'm primarily a web developer so I can't as to whether the problem exists with a
standalone app.  I will write up a small 'hello world' deal soon to test it out.
The problem does not exist when I debug a standalone, simple application.
Marking as works for me. Sounds like a problem with sysdeo, or perhaps debug 
attribtues missing from classfiles you are debugging against.
This is how I normally fix it when debugging under Sysdeo with Tomcat 4.1.x: 
a) make sure the project is open; b) stop tomcat; c) go to Window &gt; Preferences 
&gt; Tomcat &gt; Source Path; d) check the checkbox next to the project; e) save 
preferences. After this debuging is fine, no idea how and why.
Thanks for updating - sounds like a Sysdeo configuration issue.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>In the following code, Klass.CONSTANT is available as an autocompletion by
typing "Klass." and pressing Ctrl-Space:

  Vector&lt;String&gt; list = x.getVect(Klass.CONSTANT);

However, there are no autocompletions available in the corresponding position of
the following:

  for (String str : x.getVect(Klass.CONSTANT))

Interestingly though, "x." provides "x.getVect" as an autocompletion in the
second example, but "x.getVect(Klass.C" yields no autocompletions.

The enhanced for-loop syntax seems to be interfering with autocompletion.

org.eclipse.wst.dtd.validation.internal.ui.eclipse.DTDValidatePlugin.java
contained CONST_XSD_DEFAULT_PREFIX_TEXT and CONST_XSD_LANGUAGE_QUALIFY, both of 
them had their string value containing "com.ibm...".

Lawrence did a search and found out these two attributes were not referenced 
anywhere. So they have been removed from the code.


Changes are in dtd.core, wsdl.ui, xsd.ui and xsd.validation in v20050611_0054 
version.

As stated in
http://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/feature_manifest.html,
in feature.xml, &lt;discovery&gt; urls with type="web" should be treated as a regular
site, and should not be treated as a update site.

If you install the EHEP plugin (http://ehep.sf.net), the EHEP Web Site will
appear in the update site list.
The "web" type is deprecated and no longer supported, but, yes, those urls 
should not be displayed.
And the documentation must be updated... :-)
yes, where is the patch? :-)
(In reply to comment #1)
&gt; The "web" type is deprecated and no longer supported, but, yes, those urls 
&gt; should not be displayed.

Is this still true? When was this deprecated? Is that deprecation documented somewhere?

In v.3.3.2, build ID M20080221-1800, discovery sites with type="web" still appear in the Update Sites to Visit dialog, and Update Manager looks for a site.xml file at the &lt;discovery url="..."/&gt; specified in the feature.xml file.

Also, the &lt;discovery&gt; element type attribute still appears in the most current Eclipse documentation at:

http://help.eclipse.org/stable/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/feature_manifest.html

Is there someone from p2 team listening to this bug that can verify if this is will be handled correctly in the new update manager? (and be fixed in the documentation :)
CC'ing John as he just implemented this support for p2.
p2 will ignore discovery sites of type 'web'. I have updated the documentation. This component is obsolete and only major bugs are being fixed, so I'm going to close this.</WithStack>
