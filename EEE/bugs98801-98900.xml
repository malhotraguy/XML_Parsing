The "org.eclipse.ui.contexts" package in "org.eclipse.ui.workbench" is missing a
"package.html" file.
I intend to fix this doc bug for 3.1 RC2.
Also, "org.eclipse.ui.handlers".
Also, "org.eclipse.ui.keys"
I've got a patch together, but I'm waiting for Tod to commit a change to
platformOptions(.txt).
Changes to platform options added
Thanks.  Committed the rest of the changes to CVS.

In the above code, Selecting the T in T::B and doing open declaration returns no

This is because 'typename T::B' is the declspec methinks.

+ the two "for" words aren't quite right
This was fixed in 3.1
Reopening. There is a spelling error and it is a little vague.
This was added some time ago.

This need to be resolved in time for WebSphere AST beta.
Just to clarify validation framework does not have dependency on flex projects
or is flex project aware and  works on IProjects directly. It is the
responsiblity of individual validators to deal with component ahd flex projects.
In ValidatorManager.getValidattionTasks(IProject, int) the int is severity of
the validation marker. Check out the IMessage interface to get a valid list of
Severities. Reopen the the defect is there are any other issues in this area as
i do not see a defect here.

    <WithStack>It is blocking incremental state listeners.
Bala,
This class no longer makes any sense and really shouldnt' be ported or used.  We
could create a EJBComponentResource class but i don't see the need.  This
ProjectResource class had a bunch of nature api which obviously is no longer
legit.  It also had things like getEJBJar, etc...but that functionality can be
found on the EJBArtifactEdit.  If your looking for CommonArchive loading type
api you can simply use the asEJBJarFile api on EJBArtifactEditUtilities (there
are a bunch of other helper methods).  If you need api outside of this let me
know or open a defect requesting.
Changed Version field given new release numbering.

We will stop using this class as Derek stated.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Drop multiple buttons onto a Composite. Select all the buttons.
In the property sheet view, the BORDER and LINES properties don't show.
They only show if you select one control at a time
The best I can do at this time is to allow them to show up if all of the same
type are selected, e.g. all are buttons. This is because the bits are defined at
each class level. Unheroted styles do not show through as inherited, but instead
as a copy. So we don't knoe=w that canvas border and button border are the same
border style. To do this needs a change in how it is defined in beaninfo to
idicate iherited.

    <WithOutStack>Drop multiple buttons onto a Composite. Select all the buttons.
In the property sheet view, the BORDER and LINES properties don't show.
They only show if you select one control at a time
The best I can do at this time is to allow them to show up if all of the same
type are selected, e.g. all are buttons. This is because the bits are defined at
each class level. Unheroted styles do not show through as inherited, but instead
as a copy. So we don't knoe=w that canvas border and button border are the same
border style. To do this needs a change in how it is defined in beaninfo to
idicate iherited.

    <WithStack>The following compilable units are based on Eclipse code and have been 
enhanced for further requirements: 

ResizableCompartmentFigure is based on GEF's DrawerFigure class which is for 
palette functionality. 
The new class is used as a figure to represent the resizable compartment of a 
shape. It was also modified to allow subclassing.
The code has not really been enhanced but modified to be used a different 
context.

DiagramGraphicalViewerKeyHandler is based on GEF's PaletteViewerKeyHandler. 
It was modified to allow for subclassing and enhanced to enter edit mode when 
an alphanumeric is entered. This is necessary to facilitate the user entry and 
eliminate unnecessary mouse clicks. Please refer to the keyPressed() and 
isAlphaNum() methods.


AnimatableScrollPane is based on GEF's DrawerFigure. 
The size calculation methods were modified to allow the resizable compartments 
to resize in a progressive, animated manner. The size calculation takes 
progress into consideration so that the resizing occurs in increments and does 
not directly change to the destined size.

OverlayScrollPaneLayout is based on GEF's OverlayScrollPaneLayout. 
The new class adds a calculateMinimumSize method which gets the minimum size 
from the viewport.

WrapLabel is based on GEF's Label. This class was enhanced with the following 
capabilities: 
- shows selection and focus feedback (primary or secondary) 
- optionally underlines the label's text 
- wraps the label's text at a given width with a given alignment 
- supports multiple label icons

AnimationModel is based on the draw2d AnimationModel
- The constructor takes an additional parameter which represents the ascending 
or descending nature of the timer
- An additional method isFinished() allows the user to determine if the 
duration has been exceeded

The attached package contains the aforementioned code.

While looking at adding context help to the menu items on the perspective bar
(bug 90026), I realized that we don't currently have any help topics in the user
doc discussing the perspective bar itself.

It would be good to add a section describing the perspective bar.  For
organization, it could either go in the existing perspectives overview, or in
its own section (like we do for the menus).  The latter probably makes more sense.

We should also do likewise for the fast view bar and progress bar.
These topics could then be referred to from workbench overview topic describing
the overall window layout.
When there is a topic for the perspective bar, should fix up the context help
being added in bug 90026 to refer to it.

Apply from:
org.eclipse.platfrom.doc.user/tasks
This patch creates two htm files: tasks-10a.htm and tasks-10b.htm

Andre, please feel free to make corrections for them.
Turns out we already have such a page:
org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-3.htm

Could use some improvements here:
- the shortcut bar was split into the perspective bar and fast view bar in 3.0,
so there's no point mentioning "shortcut bar" anymore
- the screen shot of the perspective bar is obscured by the popup menus
- the screen shot of the fast view bar is obscured by the drag rectangle
- the text should explicitly describe the context menus and their items, or at
least mention the context menu rather than just including it in the screen shot

I don't think separate help topics are needed for the individual actions.  I
think the existing topic will suffice, with some cleanup.

I'll change the context help in bug 90026 to refer to the existing topic, as
"Perspective Bar".

I can't agree more for using existing pages. I'll work with Andrea tommorow 
for finishing it.
I have split "Shorcut Bar"(ref-3.htm) into two new docs. "Perspective Bar" 
(ref-3.htm)and "Fast View Bar" (ref-3a.htm). I have replaced the screenshots 
and with Shujie's help I have made the improvements suggested in Comment #3. 

All I need now is some info for "Progress"...Nick?

    <WithStack>From the original 3.1 undo proposal:

Undo and Redo on the toolbar should include a drop down that shows the 
operation history.  This history depends on the current part’s context.

            operationHistory.getUndoHistoryFor(myContext);

The drop down permits range selection of operations from the top down (see MS 
Word and other applications).  This UI implies a linear undo within any 
particular set of contexts.  While the selection of a range of undo operations 
is not considered that valuable, the ability to see the history is considered 
valuable.

    <WithStack>It would be nice if we could push the search functionality offered by the preference tree down into a 
reusable JFace viewer.  After using the search features in spotlight I find myself wanting to just type search 
criteria into any tree I see in eclipse and have it find the items I'm looking for.  We have a good start on 
that already in the preferences, it just needs to be elaborated on and exposed.
What is wrong with the FilteredTree?
Well, currently it's internal and it takes up a lot of space... perhaps if the search combo could be collapsed 
somehow.  Also, the behaviour on very large trees would need to be negotiated - as it is, it expands the 
entire model internally.
[since this (really useful enhancement) is not Mac specific, I'm changing Hardware/OS to All]
Marking this as a dup of bug 74795.

entire model internally.
[since this (really useful enhancement) is not Mac specific, I'm changing Hardware/OS to All]
Marking this as a dup of bug 74795.

File released
Thanks.  Marked as FIXED.
This is fixed (partially) but we need these same items added to platformOptions
and platformOptions.txt in "org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv".

Someone with doc commit rights to fix for 3.1 RC3.
It looks like my doc commit rights have arrived.
Created attachment 23094
Patch to "org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv"

Fixes both platformOptions files.
*** Bug 99417 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Committed patch to CVS.
Still missing "org.eclipse.jface.viewers.deferred".  This is covered by Bug 98791.
"org.eclipse.ui.parts" still appears twice in the "platformOptions".  This is
covered by 

Verified that every other public API package appears in the API reference once
and exactly once, and that the links load some kind of overview file.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>N20050606-0010

The following packages don't appear:
+ org.eclipse.core.commands
+ org.eclipse.core.commands.common
+ org.eclipse.core.commands.contexts
+ org.eclipse.core.commands.operations
... and well a whole bunch of others.

I'll attach a patch.
I would like this patch applied for 3.1 RC2.  Can someone with doc commit rights
please apply this?

Thanks.  Marked as FIXED.
This is fixed (partially) but we need these same items added to platformOptions
and platformOptions.txt in "org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv".

Someone with doc commit rights to fix for 3.1 RC3.
It looks like my doc commit rights have arrived.
Created attachment 23094
Patch to "org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv"

Fixes both platformOptions files.
*** Bug 99417 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Committed patch to CVS.
Still missing "org.eclipse.jface.viewers.deferred".  This is covered by Bug 98791.
"org.eclipse.ui.parts" still appears twice in the "platformOptions".  This is
covered by 

Verified that every other public API package appears in the API reference once
and exactly once, and that the links load some kind of overview file.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>I have been trying to programmatically create a Web module in a JUnit test. The
project was created ok, but it was not recognized as a Web module from the Web
module factory. When I dug down into the code, it turns out that the
WebDeployableFactory says that a Web module doesn't exist unless it has a
runtime target:

protected boolean isValidModule(IProject project) {
   if (isFlexableProject(project)) {
      IProjectProperties properties = ServerCore.getProjectProperties(project);
      if (properties != null &amp;&amp; properties.getRuntimeTarget() != null &amp;&amp;
properties.getRuntimeTarget().getRuntimeType().getModuleTypes() != null) {
         IModuleType[] moduleTypes =
properties.getRuntimeTarget().getRuntimeType().getModuleTypes();
         ...

A Web module should exist as soon as the project &amp; resources are created. Just
because the module isn't currently targetted to a runtime shouldn't make it
'disappear'.
Tim, 
I will now return true if the given project contains a module of the given type
(ie for Web is there is a web component in the project i will return true)
otherwise false...
Is this the only change you are looking for?
Yup, sounds good.
Change released for web, ejb and ear...those are the only ones implemented at
this point...let me know if you want or are ready for rar and app client
Hi Derek. Thanks for the quick fix! No rush on rar or app client, but please
make sure that this change gets applied there or doesn't get lost. Thanks again.

David, please apply patches first.  That should delete some images and set up 
structure.  Then unzip the zip files to the respective plugins to correctly 
add the updated images (patches cant handle gifs)

Thanks.
Thanks Amy.

Verifying a number of these on Amy's behalf, since she opened and fixed them on
my behalf :) And ... I did review, apply the patches, and confirmed all was well
at the time. Any new "missing resources", etc., would simply be new bugs.

    <WithStack>There are a number of install time checks that need to be performed for 
Eclipse to pass the classloading and TCK testcases.

See the OSGi issue tracker for more info.  The following issues require fixes 
in Eclipse:

341 RI should not allow extension bundles to declare import package headers
343 RI should not allow extension bundles to declare native code headers
345 RI should now allow extension bundles to declare require bundle headers.
347 RI does not fail to install a bundle which declares imports for java.* 
351 A bundle with manifest version 2 must fail to install when the manifest 
does not specify the bundle symbolic name
355 A bundle with different values for version and specification-version must 
fail to install
356 A bundle must fail to install if it specifies bundle-symbolic-name and 
bundle-version (as directives) in Export-Package 
359 A bundle must fail to install if it imports a package more than once 
361 A bundle must fail to install when the Bundle-ManifestVersion value is 
greater than 2
362 A bundle must fail to install when the manifest has a duplicate directive
370 When a package is re-exported the uses directive cannot be redefined
The following issues should already be fixed in Eclipse 3.1:

341 RI should not allow extension bundles to declare import package headers
343 RI should not allow extension bundles to declare native code headers
345 RI should now allow extension bundles to declare require bundle headers.

At the call today CPEG agreed to remove the TCK test for the following issue 
so that the TCK will pass on future frameworks:

361 A bundle must fail to install when the Bundle-ManifestVersion value is 
greater than 2

But we "should" still implement this to be complete.

Proposed fix
Pascal and Rafael, can you please review this patch from Jennifer?  I have 
already reviewed the patch.

Jeff, after everyone approves the patch, do you approve release for RC2?
Patch reviewed. It is good. Some comments have been made to Tom on the code
structure, nothing critical.

While tracing through the patch for bug 97780, I noticed that
AdapterManager.getAdapter(Object, String, boolean) checks type name equality:

    if (result == null &amp;&amp; adaptable.getClass().getName().equals(adapterType))

whereas getAdapter(Object, Class) does an instanceof check at this point:
	if (result == null &amp;&amp; adapterType.isInstance(adaptable))

For the first case, there's enough info to do a full supertype check, by
recursing over the superclasses and interfaces if the adaptable, and comparing
their names with the given string.

The list of all supertypes could be cached for performance.

Not sure if this is desired or not here, but it seems strange that it would only
check the type of the object and not supertypes.
Yes, we could do better in this case.  In fact, we already compute and maintain
a a cache of Class -&gt; Supertype list, and the cache is likely to be already
primed with that class at this point in the code.

I think this wasn't added because that entire clause is really a "bonus" check
that was never really the intended purpose of getAdapter(). I.e., if you call
getAdapter() on a class that already implements that interface, we return the
class itself if there are no factories that will perform the transformation. 

We could consider doing better here in 3.2.
There hasn't been a compelling need for this. Closing.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The result of such a move from one plug-in to another is that the moved-from
project manifest acquires an error and all users of the package outside the
moved-to plug-in acquire errors. As a result, the user has to:

1) Manually remove all references to the package in the moved-from project
manifest. This is the bug part. Refactor causes an error.

2) Manually add an export of the package to the moved-to project manifest (if it
was exported in the moved-from project).

3) Manually add a dependency to the moved-to project to all plug-ins that refer
to the package (except the moved-to project) (if they do not already have such a
dependency).

Move package should at least offer options to do these things. (1) should be
done in any event.
The description of this bug should to changed to emphasize that the
'Export-Package' header value of the Manifest.mf simply doesn't get
updated if the package structure changes (add/removed/modify/refactor).

Applying the encouraged way of describing a plugin by means of splitting
the plugin.xml into plugin.xml and Manifest.mf to an existing plugin  
results into an annoying inconvenience that the 'plugin.xml only'
plugin manifest did not have: the plugin.xml runtime/export tags allow
to specify '*' for exporting all packages.

For what ever reasons the OSGi specification doesn't allow to use wildcards,
so we need PDE support here.


agree that we should look at having an option on a plugin project to say "I 
intend to export all packages".  Users woudl then get a warning if their 
export list does not include all packages.

Either wway, there should be a warning (perhaps there is) if a plugin exports 
packages that it does not have or get from somewhere else.
#1 and #2 as outlined in comment 0 are now done automatically by PDE.  The 
Export-Package for the originating/destination manifest.mf get updated after a 
package move.

#3 is a good suggestion and will be done soon.

As for the lack of export * in a manifest.mf, this is a separate issue that 
will be addressed in bug 82819.


so #1 and #2 from comment 0 were done a while back.

#3 would be too aggressive for refactoring, where we are expected to be 100% 
sure of what the user wants.  Messing with the Require-Bundle header is 
questionable in this case.

What I have done now however, is that if all plug-ins that had depended on a 
package via Import-Package, they would be updated when a package gets 
renamed.  Works pretty nicely.</WithStack>

This is a patch that adds a check to see if any items in a tree are visible
Not sure about this.  When no items are visible, you still can set the top 
item.  GG to evaluate the patch.
Well your in a call to show item, which I believe is meant to move the tree to
the the item and shift everything upward if only that particular item is
visible.  What is happening on QNX is that showItem gets called before the Tree
gets properly sized, so the visibleItemsCount is set to zero because the tree is
reported as being one pixel big.  It sets the top most item to the currently
selected item in the tree due to the current logic in showItem.  This causes
problems for any tree that saves the last selected item.  For example, the
preferences page.  The first time you open the preference page during a session
you are fine because the top most item is the currently selected one.  However,
if java is selected, and you close the preference page, then reopen it, Java is
now the top most item and none of the items above it can be seen.  You can still
use the up arrow to get to them ( it doesn't actually show them until you close
the preference page and then reopen it ).  Also, there is already code in
showItem to determine if you need to set the topItem.  I realize that a
visibleItemCount of 0 is probably a very special case, but it happens in Photon.

    <WithStack>With IES 3.0 when the eclipse environment got into a bad state folks will often 
delete workspace and eclipse/configuration folder.

With IES 3.1 deleting the configuration folder causes the eclipse environment 
to be destroyed so that the platform can no longer load.

Specifically it is the removal of the config.ini file within the configuration 
folder that is causing the problem.

Don't delete config.ini
	

After modifying an Eclipse install by means other than the Eclipse Update
manager (e.g., after unzipping a new plug-in or feature into your Eclipse
install directory, the next time you restart Eclipse you need to use the -clean
option to ensure that the changes are noticed and picked up.

Note: In the past, some people accomplished the desired outcome by deleting the
configuration folder in the install directory. This is no longer possible
because the config.ini file in that directory contains vital irreplaceable
information. If you still prefer mucking with the configuration directory
instead of using -clean, you should delete the inner folders but leave
config.ini alone.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>With IES 3.0 when the eclipse environment got into a bad state folks will often 
delete workspace and eclipse/configuration folder.

With IES 3.1 deleting the configuration folder causes the eclipse environment 
to be destroyed so that the platform can no longer load.

Specifically it is the removal of the config.ini file within the configuration 
folder that is causing the problem.

    <WithStack>There are a number of utility and similar classes currently in JST that provide 
non-JST specific function (ie. could be moved to WST) and/or that were needed 
by WST component plugins and have been cloned to WST (ie. need to be removed, 
and have callers redirected to their replacements in WST). Some of these are 
tagged by "TODO"s in the Java source.

Note: This item is open ended. There are a fairly small number of classes that 
need to be refactored from JST to WST, and a much, much larger number that 
could be refactored (such as the extensible wizards themselves). This 
requirement is meant only to tackle the small number of "need to refactor" 
classes.
Internal tweakage. Not required in 0.7. Deferred.
Kathy, for the moment, I'm clearing the target on this enhancement on the 
premise that all the utility classes we might use are for internal use by the 
Web services platform and do not need to be moved for WTP 1.0. If there are any 
utility classes that should be public, we'll handle them under one of the 
enhancements we have for defining the public API for the Web services platform.
Internal code clean up. Some utility classes had been refactored already.  Separate defects would be opened to handle specific cases that's still remaining.
Fair 'nuff. Closed.</WithStack>

to the WSE. It is not specifically required in WTP 0.7, and there are other 
true defects that need our attention in the dying days of 0.7. It should 
suffice to deliver this enhancement in WTP 1.0.
This is entwined with enhancement bug 98844. Targetting M10.

Updated summary to include support for nillable elements.
*** Bug 98843 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
changing target from 1.5 M1 to 1.5 M5 to reflect new numbering system as we join Collisto. 
*** Bug 102187 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
M5 is drawing too close (to be declared in just over a week - 3/3) to put any significant changes into the WSE. Retargetting to M6.
Created attachment 37229
contains changes to explorer

I have moved the changes that were in rad 6 regarding Nils and attributes into wtp. There was some differences in how I accessed attributes in the xsd model. I have accounted for this and tested the WSE using significant tests from firemans fund which originaly showed the need for the change.
This attachment is ready for review
Thanks Gil. Patch reviewed and committed (less a couple dead methods / code fragments and an unnecessary change to build-war-pde.xml).

Kathy, please release this later today along with other committed fixes. Thanks - CB.
Released to WTP 1.5 as v200604052251.

    <WithStack>Eclipse 3.1 M7 seems to be very unstable with GTK+ 2.6.7. Eclipse crashes nearly
every time when a view is scrolled horizontally. Sometimes crashes occur when
opening a open file dialog; sometimes elsewhere. Many crashes are seemingly
random and such crashes are very frequent. The crashes do not seem to be related
to any specific theme engine - the crashes occur also using the default
theme/icon set. With GTK+ 2.4.14 there are no problems so putting a GTK+ 2.4.14
installation in LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running Eclipse helps.

Eclipse is the prebuilt version from
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.1M7-200505131415/eclipse-SDK-3.1M7-linux-gtk.tar.gz
and everything else is built from sources with GCC 3.4.4. The system is running
Glibc 2.3.4, Linux 2.6.11.5-mh2, GNOME 2.10.1, X.org 6.8.2.

Another crash log
This sounds a lot like the problem I was debugging for bug 79618.  Do you happen
to have used "-O3 -march=pentium4" or something similar when you compiled GTK+?
Yes, in fact I do. :) I've built it with CFLAGS=-O3 -march=pentium4
-fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops.
Try adding -mno-sse2 to the build of GTK+ and see if the crashes stop.
At this point I am pretty convinced this is a duplicate of bug 79618.  We are
getting closer to figuring it out too.  See this gcc bug for more information:

  http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21973

If you could run using the Sun 1.5 VM the crash logs would be useful as they
have more information, and it would confirm what's going on even further.  Also,
if the crashes stop if you recompile GTK+ with -mno-sse2 then this will also
confirm it.

Crash log with JDK 1.5.0_03
Thanks, this is the same crash as referred to in the gcc bug.  Recompiling GTK+
with "-mno-sse2" should work around the problem.

I have started with a fresh install and it doesn't do it at first, but then
starts doing it. My RC1 install works fine when using itself as the target
platform, but won't work when using any other.

I know this isn't much of a repro, but it has me at a dead stop. I even killed
my workspace and started over and that had me going for a while but it is now
failing again.

If I can send any files to help with the repro, let me know.
Looks like a dup of bug 97148 (there is a patched
org.eclipse.update.configurator_3.1.0.jar there). If using that patch it still
does not work for you, please reopen.

is not.  The Background label should be enabled as well.
Phil,
  looks like in JSPStyledTextColorPicker#activate

you should have:
fBackgroundLabel.setEnabled(true);

instead of
fBackgroundLabel.setEnabled(false);

Changed Version field given new release numbering.

The button colors are also not changing to reflect the settings in JSP Content

Here's a patch to JSPStyledTextColorPicker

I found a better solution that will fix both the problem I mentioned and

The fix is in activiate, call super.activate to set up all the controls first,

    <WithStack>The incremental search (ctrl+j) automatically switches into case sensitive mode
when a capital letter is typed.  However if that capital letter is undone with a
backspace, the search is still case sensitive.  The search has to be canceled
and started again to switch back to case insensitive mode.

Emacs has a similar automatic case senstive incremenatl search, however it
removes the case sensitivity when the capital letter is removed.
Works for me using N20050607-0010. See also:
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-text-home/development/bug-incomplete.htm
I just tested this again with build:  I20050527-1300 (3.1RC1)
Let me try to describe it better.  

1. Make a file with the word "Test" in it 2 times.  For example:
"This is a Test of my Test."
2. Hit &lt;ctrl&gt;-j and type "tes" it should find the first Test.  
3. now type 'T' so you are searching for tesT.  It should find nothing.
4. now type backspace (perhaps a few times) until the 'T' is deleted.
5. The search is now searching for "tes" but it doesn't find anything, but it
should.  

My theory is that when the capital T is typed the case sensitivity is enabled
but when the T is deleted that case sensitivity is not disabled.
You're right. I must have tried a wrong scenario

    <WithStack>The Ant editor will pick up macrodefs and provide auto-completion of the macro 
(and jump to definition when requested) as expected if the macrodef has _no_ 
uri. Putting the macrodef in a namespace by setting the 'uri' attribute will 
break this behaviour (the actual build.xml runs ok in ant, its just the editor 
which fails to see the definition).

This behavior was found regardless of location of macrodef (ie, external file 
imported or inline in the build.xml).

--- Sample build.xml ---

&lt;project name="test" default="run-macro" xmlns:xyz="http://xyz" &gt;

	&lt;macrodef name="echo-macro" uri="http://xyz"&gt;
		&lt;attribute name="str"/&gt;
		&lt;sequential&gt;
			&lt;echo&gt;@{str}&lt;/echo&gt;
		&lt;/sequential&gt;
	&lt;/macrodef&gt;
	
	&lt;target name="run-macro" &gt;
		&lt;xyz:echo-macro str="Hello World"/&gt; &lt;!-- this doesn't auto-complete --&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
Investigating a solution to correctly lookup defined tasks/types in namespaces.
Plan to fix for Rc2
We still have bug 99075....but much more works than it did.

Changes to:
AntEditorCompletionProcessor: to correct "translate" elementnames to handle 
namespaces.

XMLTextHover: consider ':' to be part of tags

ProjectHelper: notify the AntModel of prefix to uri mappings

AntModel: cache the prefix to uri mappings and expose translation of element 
names to and from these mappings

Tests added to:
AntEditorTests for the opening of declaration of namespaced node
CodeCompletionTests for proposals for namespaced elements. Also fixed up so 
that the tests dispose the created ant models
98853.xml test file added.

Ben, any and all testing on this support would be greatly appreciated.
Please verify Kevin (and Ben).

When running with a shared (initialized) install, Update writes a new config.ini
to the local configuration location pointing to the parent configuration (using
the osgi.sharedConfiguration.area property).

This config.ini may already exist (the framework is able to load values from
both). In that case, Update overwrites the existing one. It should just update
it to have the osgi.sharedConfiguration.area property.
I could provide a patch if one is requested.
The config.ini is only writen when  a valid platform.xml is not there.
A simple fix would be to check for the existence of the file prior to writing:

File configIni = new File(newConfigIniURL.getFile());
if (configIni.exists())
    return;

in the PlatformConfiguration.linkInitializedState(...)
Is this what you had in mind? If not,please provide a patch. Thanks!
I guess that would be enough (no need to update the existing file). I actually
do not understand the scenario that requires Update to write a config.ini, since
that value either is automatically determined, or is explicitly provided.
this is more of a legacy thing, when config.ini was not even provided, and the 
configurator was generating it (even in regular, non-shared installs)

I can see situations in which config.ini would have to be generated by 
configurator, but I don't fully understand all the usages (and defaults) of 
config.ini.

So, please provide the patch that makes you the happiest and I will check it 
in.
This was not deemed important due to the lack of use cases requiring a
pre-existing local config.ini to be supported. 

Once the config.ini is created, further changes made to it are not overriden.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I received the following code snippet as a suggested performance improvement.
This would also eliminate the "out of handles" seen using the IBM JRE due to
excessive jar_cache&lt;id&gt;.tmp files. 

When plugins leverage the compatibility runtime, jar_cache files are created. 
The is triggered by IPluginDescriptor.getResourceBundle().  This would also be
cause by Platform.getResourceBundle(bundle) provided the Plugin/Bundle has a
requirement for the compatibility runtime.

When the Bundle is treated as a 2.1 Plugin, a new ClassLoader is built to load
the plugin.properties.  The URLs added to the URLClassLoader are of the form
bundleentry://xx/yyyy and in most cases point to a JAR file, e.g.,
bundleentry://59/infra.jar.  These eventually get wrapped as a JAR URL so they
look like jar://bundleentry://59/infra.jar/!.  The request to find the resource
is delegated to each URL.  The URLClassLoader creates a "Loader" for each URL. 
If the URL is considered local, the file on disk is used directly otherwise a
local copy is made since the assumption is its remote.  The check looks
specifically for a file:// URL.

A solution is to resolve all URLs to a native URL using Platform.resolve. I
believe its something the Eclipse guys might just want.

Keith, can you clearly specify the origin of the code you received and confirm 
that you are legitimately able to contribute it here?  We like to know where 
the code is coming from.
I wrote the code.
Michael Fraenkel, and IBM employee, wrote the code and attached it to an
internal problem report.

Several years ago IBM approved me as an Eclipse committer.
We are now about to ship 3.2 and by now most people have converted out of 2.1, therefore I'm not too keen in releasing that. Keith is that ok with you?
Some applications consuming our platform are still running with compatiblity enabled so we would prefer the fix included.

However, I understand the rationale for marking it as "will not fix" and there is no strong objection.</WithStack>

Randy, Ctrl for not snapping on Mac is fine, right?
Randy, do we want to fix case 2 or 3 (3 is in the text example, so not as 
important)?  If not, I can mark this bug as fixed.
We can not fix case 2 right now. It is too risky to use Command key. For 3), 
there are lots of differences in our example, but it is just an example so post 
3.1.
Marking this as fixed.  Case 2 to be considered post-3.1.  I'll open another 
bug report for that.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The version of RAD I'm using has
IES 3.0.3: 200505201648.

STEPS:
1. created a Java project (NumbersProj) and then after this switched to a Test 
perspective
2. created a folder in this project (junittests)
3. imported a zip file into this project (see attachment)
4. created a junit test suite in the junittests folder 
(GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest) by selecting
    File-&gt;New-Other-&gt;Test Suite-&gt;JUnit Test Suite Definition
5. created a junit testcase in this test suite (selected 
GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest from the
    Test Navigator view and then New-&gt;Test Artifact from its context menu.  
Selected Test-&gt;Test 
    Elements-&gt;Test Case.  Specified JUnit Test Method and a name of 
testGenerateNumber).
6. from the JUnit test suite editor, verified testGenerateNumber appeared as a 
test method
7. from the Behavior page of the test suite editor, specified an invocation for 
testGenerateNumber
8. closed the test suite, saving the changes made
9. from the Test Navigator view, selected GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest and 
then Generate...
    from its context menu
10. used browse button to select NumbersProj as the Java project (Source folder 
became disabled/grey)
11. from a Package Explorer view, double-clicked on 
GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest.java to open
    it
12. typed the following in for the body of the testgeneratenumber() method:
     GaussianIntegerRandomGenerator randomGenerator = new 
GaussianIntegerRandomGenerator();
     randomGenerator.reset();
     randomeGenerator.setMinMax(1,3);
     int randomNum = randomeGenerator.generateNumber();
    assertTture(randomNum &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; randomNum &lt; 3);
13. closed the test file, saving the changes made
14. from the Test Navigator view, selected GaussianRandomNumberTest and then 
Run-&gt;Test from
    its context menu

RESULT:
An hour glass appears when the mouse is in the Test Navigator view and never 
disappears.
No progress indicator appears in the lower right to indicate it's doing 
anything.
The Task Manager shows the RAD IDE as not responding.
It's was hung for at least 5 minutes, so I killed it.

NOTE: someone on our PVT test team reported a Core Exception when last 
attempting this
scenario (RATLC01085978), but I don't get any core exception and no .log file 
exists.

I did play around with this more and found some workarounds.  That is, after I 
killed RAD from the Task Manager and restarted it, I then selected the Test in 
the Test Navigator view but this time selected Run-&gt;Run.  The Run window 
appeared and Generated Configuration appeared open.  This configuration was 
listed under the Test category in the Configurations list on the left and must 
have been created by the tooling when I had selected Run-&gt;Test.  It showed 
GaussianIntegerRandomeNumberTest as the test to run and local_deployment as the 
selected deployment.  What I did is create a JUnit configuration that 
referenced the same test class and ran that from the Run window and it ran 
successfully.  I then opened the Generated Configuration again and selected the 
Run button in the Run window and was surprised that that was successful (it 
didn't hang).  So, I then went back to the Test Navigator view and tried 
selecting the test and then Run-&gt;Test and again it hung.
Created attachment 22578
testcase
Upgrading to P1 as per Steve Francisco's request.
This flow doesn't appear in our test cases (though we'll add it.)  My 
understand from Kathy Endres is that this test case has never passed (was just 
recently added to their test case.)  I am able to reproduce this in 3.3, and 
also in 3.2.  The fact that we hang is obviously a big problem, so we should 
consider fixing it in 3.3, but the fact that the problem has been there since 
3.2 (and likely since the shortcut was first put in place) without anyone 
reporting it is also worth considering.

The hang is caused by a syncExec() call in the 
org.eclipse.hyades.ui.internal.provider.ResourceChangeUpdaterProvider.doProcess
Delta(IResourceDelta) method.  syncExec is a notorious cause of deadlocks, and 
its use is stringly discouraged by Eclipse.  I am surprised to see this call 
appearing in a frequently used class such as ResourceChangeUpdaterProvider.  
Changing the call to asyncExec() fixes this problem, but obviously introduces 
some delay between the time the listener is notified and the time the 
notification's results are displayed.

This class is used by the TestNavigator, LogNavigator and 
LogNavigatorSynchronizer, so making the change could cause problems in other 
components.  The hand is likley caused by the launch configuration code 
holding a lock when the launch in invoked.  It's also possible that we could 
address this problem by changing the run shortcut code to launch the test 
using a different mechanism (when you launch the test from the launch 
configuration dialog directly, the code path is different, which likely 
explains why this is only hit when running the tes from the shortcut.)  

I'd like to understand if this is something that we want to hold 3.3. up for, 
and if so, we need to discuss the asyncExec call with the other consumers or 
investigate an alternat way of launching the test from the shortcut (which I 
expect can be done b/c we have products that support this.)
Looking at CVS, this feature has been here since 3.0.  I find it hard to 
believe that it has never worked, but the problem appears in 3.2 and 3.3 at 
least.

Reassigning to Julien.  I am not sure what changed to cause this hang to 
occur -- can you please take a look at this and suggest what could be done to 
safely fix it in 3.3?  
The difference between launching a test using the shorcut and launching the same
test using the launch configuration dialog is that the shorcut launch occurs in
the UI thread, whereas the launch config launch occurs in Eclipse "launch" job.

So, I have modified the launch shorcut code to leverage Eclipse API for
launching the test using the same job as the launch configuration does. The
change consists in replacing:
    DebugUITools.saveAndBuildBeforeLaunch();
    lconfig.launch(mode, new NullProgressMonitor());
with:
    DebugUIPlugin.launchInBackground(lconfig, mode);

This same modification was made in the 4.0 branch a few months ago (as an
enhancement), so this fix sounds to me not only safe, but even an improvement.

However, even if this change fixes this specific problem, I think we may still
have a problem because of this syncExec() call in the method
org.eclipse.hyades.ui.internal.provider.ResourceChangeUpdaterProvider.doProcess
Delta(IResourceDelta) mentionned by Joe. But replacing syncExec() with
asyncExec() at this stage of the 3.3 release life sounds risky, as this
ResourceChangeUpdaterProvider is invoking listeners both in TPTP and TPTP
consumers. How about making it only in 4.0, provided that 4.0 has still a few
weeks of testing ahead?

    <WithOutStack>The version of RAD I'm using has
IES 3.0.3: 200505201648.

STEPS:
1. created a Java project (NumbersProj) and then after this switched to a Test 
perspective
2. created a folder in this project (junittests)
3. imported a zip file into this project (see attachment)
4. created a junit test suite in the junittests folder 
(GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest) by selecting
    File-&gt;New-Other-&gt;Test Suite-&gt;JUnit Test Suite Definition
5. created a junit testcase in this test suite (selected 
GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest from the
    Test Navigator view and then New-&gt;Test Artifact from its context menu.  
Selected Test-&gt;Test 
    Elements-&gt;Test Case.  Specified JUnit Test Method and a name of 
testGenerateNumber).
6. from the JUnit test suite editor, verified testGenerateNumber appeared as a 
test method
7. from the Behavior page of the test suite editor, specified an invocation for 
testGenerateNumber
8. closed the test suite, saving the changes made
9. from the Test Navigator view, selected GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest and 
then Generate...
    from its context menu
10. used browse button to select NumbersProj as the Java project (Source folder 
became disabled/grey)
11. from a Package Explorer view, double-clicked on 
GaussianIntegerRandomNumberTest.java to open
    it
12. typed the following in for the body of the testgeneratenumber() method:
     GaussianIntegerRandomGenerator randomGenerator = new 
GaussianIntegerRandomGenerator();
     randomGenerator.reset();
     randomeGenerator.setMinMax(1,3);
     int randomNum = randomeGenerator.generateNumber();
    assertTture(randomNum &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; randomNum &lt; 3);
13. closed the test file, saving the changes made
14. from the Test Navigator view, selected GaussianRandomNumberTest and then 
Run-&gt;Test from
    its context menu

RESULT:
An hour glass appears when the mouse is in the Test Navigator view and never 
disappears.
No progress indicator appears in the lower right to indicate it's doing 
anything.
The Task Manager shows the RAD IDE as not responding.
It's was hung for at least 5 minutes, so I killed it.

NOTE: someone on our PVT test team reported a Core Exception when last 
attempting this
scenario (RATLC01085978), but I don't get any core exception and no .log file 
exists.

I did play around with this more and found some workarounds.  That is, after I 
killed RAD from the Task Manager and restarted it, I then selected the Test in 
the Test Navigator view but this time selected Run-&gt;Run.  The Run window 
appeared and Generated Configuration appeared open.  This configuration was 
listed under the Test category in the Configurations list on the left and must 
have been created by the tooling when I had selected Run-&gt;Test.  It showed 
GaussianIntegerRandomeNumberTest as the test to run and local_deployment as the 
selected deployment.  What I did is create a JUnit configuration that 
referenced the same test class and ran that from the Run window and it ran 
successfully.  I then opened the Generated Configuration again and selected the 
Run button in the Run window and was surprised that that was successful (it 
didn't hang).  So, I then went back to the Test Navigator view and tried 
selecting the test and then Run-&gt;Test and again it hung.

testcase
Upgrading to P1 as per Steve Francisco's request.
This flow doesn't appear in our test cases (though we'll add it.)  My 
understand from Kathy Endres is that this test case has never passed (was just 
recently added to their test case.)  I am able to reproduce this in 3.3, and 
also in 3.2.  The fact that we hang is obviously a big problem, so we should 
consider fixing it in 3.3, but the fact that the problem has been there since 
3.2 (and likely since the shortcut was first put in place) without anyone 
reporting it is also worth considering.

The hang is caused by a syncExec() call in the 
org.eclipse.hyades.ui.internal.provider.ResourceChangeUpdaterProvider.doProcess
Delta(IResourceDelta) method.  syncExec is a notorious cause of deadlocks, and 
its use is stringly discouraged by Eclipse.  I am surprised to see this call 
appearing in a frequently used class such as ResourceChangeUpdaterProvider.  
Changing the call to asyncExec() fixes this problem, but obviously introduces 
some delay between the time the listener is notified and the time the 
notification's results are displayed.

This class is used by the TestNavigator, LogNavigator and 
LogNavigatorSynchronizer, so making the change could cause problems in other 
components.  The hand is likley caused by the launch configuration code 
holding a lock when the launch in invoked.  It's also possible that we could 
address this problem by changing the run shortcut code to launch the test 
using a different mechanism (when you launch the test from the launch 
configuration dialog directly, the code path is different, which likely 
explains why this is only hit when running the tes from the shortcut.)  

I'd like to understand if this is something that we want to hold 3.3. up for, 
and if so, we need to discuss the asyncExec call with the other consumers or 
investigate an alternat way of launching the test from the shortcut (which I 
expect can be done b/c we have products that support this.)
Looking at CVS, this feature has been here since 3.0.  I find it hard to 
believe that it has never worked, but the problem appears in 3.2 and 3.3 at 
least.

    <WithStack>Description:
Eclipse occasionally hangs during Java/C++ development (using JDT and CDT) when
Galeon is also running on the system. The hanging is not permanent, and Eclipse
"comes back to life" after a time. The duration of the hang is variable and is
on the order of minutes. The longest time I have experienced is around 20
minutes, and the shortest about 2-3 minutes. During the hang, no CPU, memory, or
network resources are consumed (at least according to my system monitor), the
harddisk is not in use, and 'top' reports that Eclipse is sleeping. The entire
Eclipse GUI does not paint (refresh) during a hang.

Observations:
I first noticed this problem when loading Eclipse after having started Galeon,
and Eclipse would take an extremely long time to come up.

A low amount of free memory seems to aggravate the problem. In fact, adding
-Xmx128M to the java command line reduced the frequency of the problem.

If Eclipse is started before Galeon, it comes up as expected, but may become
unresponsive later, after Galeon has started.

Logging out and logging back in seems to aleviate the problem. That is, until
Galeon is started again.

This problem also existed in earlier versions of Eclipse (specifically 2.1.1).

The problem does not appear while running Mozilla. The problem does not appear
if Galeon has not been started. Closing Galeon (after the problem occurs) does
not prevent the problem from future occurrence. Logging out and in again (which
restarts X) is the only way I can find to make a clean start.

The problem seems unspecific. It sometimes occurs during plain typing, sometimes
during CPU-intensive GUI-driven tasks, sometimes during simple GUI-driven tasks
(e.g. right-click for context menu). It occurs independent of a particular
component or plugin. However, it does seem to occur more frequently when
attempting more CPU-intensive tasks like switching perspectives.

Suspicions:
Is GTK the problem? (Galeon uses GTK.)
Is there something Eclipse is waiting on? (a lock file or something, perhaps
shared with Galeon, Gnome, or GTK?) Does this waiting time out, allowing Eclipse
to "come back?"
Is it a memory allocation problem? (e.g. Is Eclipse waiting for more memory to
be allocated that is not allocated for some time?)

First guess: galeon owns the X clipboard and is being unresponsive.

To find out what's going on, run eclipse from a terminal window, and look up the
process ID of the java process from top or ps.  When a hang occurs, do "kill -3
&lt;pid_of_java&gt;".  This will ask the VM to print a stack trace to the terminal.

Do you have any clipboard managers running (like KDE's klipper)?

&gt; First guess: galeon owns the X clipboard and is being unresponsive.

It seems your guess may be correct. The trace says the main thread is waiting on
the clipboard.

&gt; Do you have any clipboard managers running (like KDE's klipper)?

I am not aware that I have any clipboard managers running. 'klipper' is not to
be found in 'ps aux'. I have not knowingly started any clipboard managers.
I would also be interested in knowing if this problem is as easily reproducable
using a build of Eclipse 3.1.

(In reply to comment #3)

Here is another trace. This time I payed attention to the contents of my
clipboard. (I couldn't remember the contents after submitting the previous
trace, but it wasn't anything large or extraordinary, and they were long gone
by the time I read your reply.)

The clipboard was empty. The paste menu item was disabled under Galeon, and
neither Ctrl-V or middle-mouse-button yielded anything. Since logging in, I had
only opened Galeon to check my e-mail, and had not copied or selected anything.
I then proceeded to start eclipse (as always, from a terminal), which went
through its first phase of startup, and then hung, leaving me with the splash
screen. (This is a typical instance of the problem.) At that point, I examined
the clipboard (by trying to paste) and made the trace. 

Also, since Eclipse's GUI hadn't come up yet, I couldn't have been trying to
paste anything. In fact, I can't remember any time that I experienced a hang
that occurred while trying to cut/copy/paste something. They usually occur
during startup, while doing a GUI intensive operation (e.g. perspective
switch), activating a menu (right-click or menu bar), and I remember one day
where it happened frequently during Java code updating -you know, coloring,
fixing/finding errors, whatever "as you go" code analysis and compilation that
goes on. That was the day that would have been most closely related to the
clipboard. For example, paste a new method and then Eclipse hangs when doing
the code analysis.

BTW, if you think this problem relates directly to the clipboard, I welcome
suggestions for ways of examining the system clipboard. (Should I run
'klipper'? Is there a command line program to examine the X clipboard? Are
there special cases for pasting that would lead me to believe the clipboard
empty when it in reality wasn't?)
Billy wrote a little application that will tell you who owns the clipboard:

http://vektor.ca/eclipse/xclipowner.c

See Bug 74498 (Comment #6) for more instructions on how to use this 
application.

When you hang, could you check who owns the clipboard and report it here?

Created attachment 22867
Java thread dump

This trace corresponds to the JVM when the X information was gathered
(clipboard owner and window hierarchy dump).
Did you have any text selected in Galeon?  xclipowner indicates that Galeon is
asserting ownership of the PRIMARY clipboard.

The problem you are seeing should be solved in Eclipse 3.1, which only checks
PRIMARY when you actually hit the middle mouse button to paste it.
(In reply to comment #10)

I have been using 3.1RC2 for 2 days running now, and I haven't experienced any
hangs. So the problems appears to be fixed, although this is hard to confirm
without a concrete test case, of course.

Out of curiosity, why does Eclipse wait for the clipboard contents when this can
block and cause a hang? Seemingly it would make more sense for an asynchronous
interface with the system clipboard. Then maybe the user could paste the empty
string if the clipboard contents were not received within 1 second, or something
similar. I understand the system clipboard uses a call back mechanism. Why
couldn't this be used with Eclipse?

Anyway, I'm glad to hear that Eclipse only asks for the clipboard when
necessary. Hanging during startup was certainly misleading in that you wouldn't
expect it to try to fetch the clipboard contents until you had tried to paste
something.
While the X clipboard is asynchronous, many toolkits have synchronous APIs. 
Both Qt and Xt have blocking clipboard APIs, each with a 5 second timeout.  GTK+
encourages applications to use the clipboard asynchronously, although this can
lead to strange behaviour if applications are lagged.  For example, try copying
some text in your browser, suspend the browser process (^Z), and hit Ctrl+V five
times in a gedit window.  Then, resume the browser.  It's a lot of fun.

The timeout in GTK+ for a hung application is 30 seconds, but it used to be five
minutes:   http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155428 (+ a debate on IRC)

Applications often check the clipboard contents to know if there is some MIME
type they are interested in, and if so, they will enable the "Paste" action in
their menus.  Many views in Eclipse only respond to certain types, and so they
have a tendancy to check the clipboard often.

While we still tend to check CLIPBOARD, we check PRIMARY (the middle-button
paste buffer) only when you hit the middle mouse button.  Could you try
selecting some text in Galeon and pasting it many times over in eclipse?  Does
this cause a hang?
(In reply to comment #12)

So, I tried selecting comment #12 (viewed with Galeon) and pasting it into a
plain text editor in Eclipse. I tried it with both the middle mouse and Ctrl-V.

I could not get Eclipse to hang.

However, the insertion of text into the editor does not seem to scale well. I
realize this is probably not your issue, but it is part of what I observed. If
you think it would be worth passing on, please do. I thought I'd mention it
because one of the themes for Eclipse 3 is scalability.

I pasted according to a quick rhythm. (I was listening to some bebop.) What
happens (with both methods of pasting) is that the paste lags once in a while.
The lag is characterized by a CPU spike. As more and more is pasted, the lags
get more frequent. Once the editor has 5000-6000 lines in it, the paste lags
about every other time. This was much more pronounced with the insertion point
somewhere in the middle of the text rather than at the end.

Towards the end of the pasting experiment the CPU would be about 66% used with
spikes (&gt; 90%) according to the lags. I have an Athlon XP 2200 (1800 MHz), so
this might not be as much of an issue for more modern hardware. I think it
deserves mention, though, because the user will probably expect pasting to be a
constant time operation (in proportion to the size of the text pasted, at
least), and it appears that this is not the case, as my paste size stayed the
same and the time it took to paste increased.

Scalability aside, unless you give me more tests to try, the clipboard problem
seems to be solved.</WithStack>

Did you have any text selected in Galeon?  xclipowner indicates that Galeon is
asserting ownership of the PRIMARY clipboard.

The problem you are seeing should be solved in Eclipse 3.1, which only checks
PRIMARY when you actually hit the middle mouse button to paste it.
(In reply to comment #10)

I have been using 3.1RC2 for 2 days running now, and I haven't experienced any
hangs. So the problems appears to be fixed, although this is hard to confirm
without a concrete test case, of course.

Out of curiosity, why does Eclipse wait for the clipboard contents when this can
block and cause a hang? Seemingly it would make more sense for an asynchronous
interface with the system clipboard. Then maybe the user could paste the empty
string if the clipboard contents were not received within 1 second, or something
similar. I understand the system clipboard uses a call back mechanism. Why
couldn't this be used with Eclipse?

Anyway, I'm glad to hear that Eclipse only asks for the clipboard when
necessary. Hanging during startup was certainly misleading in that you wouldn't
expect it to try to fetch the clipboard contents until you had tried to paste
something.
While the X clipboard is asynchronous, many toolkits have synchronous APIs. 
Both Qt and Xt have blocking clipboard APIs, each with a 5 second timeout.  GTK+
encourages applications to use the clipboard asynchronously, although this can
lead to strange behaviour if applications are lagged.  For example, try copying
some text in your browser, suspend the browser process (^Z), and hit Ctrl+V five
times in a gedit window.  Then, resume the browser.  It's a lot of fun.

The timeout in GTK+ for a hung application is 30 seconds, but it used to be five
minutes:   http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155428 (+ a debate on IRC)

Applications often check the clipboard contents to know if there is some MIME
type they are interested in, and if so, they will enable the "Paste" action in
their menus.  Many views in Eclipse only respond to certain types, and so they
have a tendancy to check the clipboard often.

While we still tend to check CLIPBOARD, we check PRIMARY (the middle-button
paste buffer) only when you hit the middle mouse button.  Could you try
selecting some text in Galeon and pasting it many times over in eclipse?  Does
this cause a hang?
(In reply to comment #12)

So, I tried selecting comment #12 (viewed with Galeon) and pasting it into a
plain text editor in Eclipse. I tried it with both the middle mouse and Ctrl-V.

I could not get Eclipse to hang.

However, the insertion of text into the editor does not seem to scale well. I
realize this is probably not your issue, but it is part of what I observed. If
you think it would be worth passing on, please do. I thought I'd mention it
because one of the themes for Eclipse 3 is scalability.

I pasted according to a quick rhythm. (I was listening to some bebop.) What
happens (with both methods of pasting) is that the paste lags once in a while.
The lag is characterized by a CPU spike. As more and more is pasted, the lags
get more frequent. Once the editor has 5000-6000 lines in it, the paste lags
about every other time. This was much more pronounced with the insertion point
somewhere in the middle of the text rather than at the end.

Towards the end of the pasting experiment the CPU would be about 66% used with
spikes (&gt; 90%) according to the lags. I have an Athlon XP 2200 (1800 MHz), so
this might not be as much of an issue for more modern hardware. I think it
deserves mention, though, because the user will probably expect pasting to be a
constant time operation (in proportion to the size of the text pasted, at
least), and it appears that this is not the case, as my paste size stayed the
same and the time it took to paste increased.

Scalability aside, unless you give me more tests to try, the clipboard problem
seems to be solved.</WithOutStack>

    <WithStack>View Close icon should have hover button to be consistent with hover button

The hover appearance would be a problem with the curve of the selected tab - 
the close would have to move to the left in order to have the rectangle fit 
inside the curve.

Would it be possible to draw a tighter rectangle around the close button and
also leave the colour of the "Close" image red on hover?
This does look more consistent.  I think we should also see it in the context of
the more rectangular tab.

Executable permission of the file is lost.
Is there a solution?
Upgrade to 3.1 which added support for transferring the executable bit.
Thank you very much.  
I confirmed with "Stream Integration Build",
But group has only read-parmittion.
(Although 'team' menu...)
I hope that I use in the same result as the command base CVS.
Even user authority does not become effective in Soalris-OS.
(Can not setting from File-&gt;property menu too...)

    <WithStack>As discussed with Tim, since 3.1 base eclipse picked up web browser API, 
and there's no longer any API being proposed here, this plugin is a good
candidate to eliminate. 

I marked as "major" because is important to get rid of this soon, 
to avoid last minute churn.
Plugin removed. The content has been merged into a new package in the
org.eclipse.wst.server.util plugin.
 * Moved code, icons, contents of plugin.xml and tests over, etc.
 * Removed webbrowser tests
 * Fixed wst, wst.server, and wst.tests features
 * Tagged and checked in everything

David - I'm not sure if there are any scheduled I-builds today. If not, I would
appreciate it if you could start one so that we can see if I've missed anything
sooner rather than later.

When and editor reference is disposed, it still hangs onto its pane, which
refers to the workbook etc.

A disposed editor reference should be as lightweight as possible, with no refs
to other workbench objects.

I'm trying to improve the editor navigation history to handle multiple editors
on the same input better, and to do so I need to hang onto the editor reference,
but history entries outlive editors, so it will be a common case for them to
refer to disposed editor references.
I agree that it should be as lightweight as possible, but it needs to hold onto
the PartPane in order to respect its invariants (for example, getPane is always
expected to return non-null).

Eclipse 3.0 did not require the pane to exist in all situations, but that forced
all callers to deal with the null case (which was not always possible, required
duplicate state, and introduced quite a few bugs).

The pane itself can (and should) clean up all its references when disposed. When
disposed, the pane's only reference should be to the workbench page (which would
be necessary for the reference anyway) - not to the stack.

That said, I would not recommend holding onto a disposed reference in any
avoidable circumstance. Perhaps we should chat about your use-case?

Unless we can refactor to make the getPane method unnecessary or impossible to
call on a disposed reference, clearing the pane pointer is INVALID. However if
the disposed pane is still referring to the stack (or any large workbench object
other than the page), this is a valid bug. Therefore, I'm renaming and keeping
this open.

I'm pretty sure the pane was still hanging onto the workbook.

Nick, now that I think about it more, it should be possible to clear the pane
pointer. The pane is used for managing the pane within the workbench layout, and
a disposed reference is a reference that is no longer in the layout... so there
should be no valid reason for asking for the pane from a disposed reference. 

However, there is still client code that hangs onto disposed references and
tries to pass them back to workbench APIs. In order to make this change, we'd
need to make sure that all of these APIs recover gracefully from recieving a
disposed reference rather than throwing a NPE the first time they ask for the pane.

Is this still a problem in 3.3?

    <WithStack>The AntDebugState incorrectly assumes that target names will be unique. They are
unique per project but subbuilds introduce multiple projects and therefore
target name collisions can occur.

This results in incorrect stack representation for target dependencies for the
subbuild.

For example with a breakpoint on line 6 of antBuildFile.xml the stack looks like:
Thread [Ant Build] (Suspended)
	depends: echo line: 6
	default line: 2
	default: ant line: 12
	default line: 2

===callExternal.xml====

Ted, any quick and easy things you can do here with JavaCC Options? 
(probably not worth "hand" fixing the code, if they'd just 
come back next time generated. )
There is a sed script that's run as a post-process to the autogenerated code.  
At this point, it fixes the things in the generated code that get tagged as 
errors (unreferenced locals and the such).  It could be easily extended to fix 
the warnings as well.  I will do that as time allows.
Thanks Ted .. FYI ... I did "hand fix" the serialVersionUID so the plugin 
doesn't show up on build page with warnings. Not a place to be visible :)
Walter, interested in fixing this bug? 

Vote to resolve.  This would be great to fix from a code perspective but as mentioned in comment #1 they would just come back after next generation.  And weather or not there was ever any progress on the build side I do not know, but if it has not happened yet it does not seem likely to happen.
This will likely not be implemented any time soon. Right now, I don't know if there's active enough development on these parsers to warrant an investigation that is outside of tweaking the sed scripts that are used right now.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I have some code that computes tree sizes on GTK+ (by walking the items) and
then calls layout on the parent component.  When I close an item that has been
opened the VM crashes.  The same code works fine on Win32 and OS X.
Created attachment 22581
The .log file created after the bug described above
Note: Crash was with GTK+ 2.4.14.

I wrote a simple example and could not cause the crash.  Is there any way you
could provide code to reproduce the problem?  Also, does it happen every time? 
Could you comment out parts of the code (maybe, don't call layout()) and see if
it still happens?
The crash doesn't show much.  It's in the event loop.
Aaron: Any update on this?
Sorry, I have nothing more.  We are in crunch time and I haven't had time to
focus on it.  I should have time to reevaluate it and create a test case in a
couple of weeks.
The code base has changed significantly since this bug was reported.  If it is still happening for you, please reopen this bug report.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I am running Eclipse 3.1 RC1, on windows 2000 English version,
when I open properties files containing chinese character, 
it could not display the correct text.
The property files is just simple text file, 
I also attached a sample file.

though I report in version 3.1 RC1, this problem is same in Eclise V3.0,

JDT's Java Editor doesn't have this problem.

you can simply add the additional input languages and fonts.
I do have installed chinese input language,
'cause in windows explorer, all chinese filenames could be displayed,
and also i have input chinese input languages,

just as i mentioned, JDT's Java Editor just could display chinese 
characters correctly in the same machine.
but neithor "Text Editor" nor "Property Editor" could work

I also changed to UTF-8, UTF-16, etc, but also could not work
OK, I now see what happens. It's about the *encoding* not the font. If you
create new properties, Java or text files they get the content types default
encoding:

*.properties files: ISO-8859-1
*.java: non / platform default

so, it's not about the editor but about what encoding is used. Try this: create
a file in the Java editor which looks good, save and open with either the Text
or Properties edtior.

another thing i just noticed is:
the file containing Chinese Characters in the properties file which I created
outside Eclipse could not display correctly,
but when I input Chinese characters in the *Property Editor*,
Chinese Character could be inputed also displayed OK, without any problem, 
but when I close the file in Eclipse, and open again, 
the place which would be chinese characters were replaced by two "??",

the attached is the hex string of the file after I saved.

So, it seems that when the file is saved,
some encoding conversion has been done to it, but failed to convert to the
corrent encode.

I just quite puzzled why in Java Editor, no this problem.
I can input Chinese Characters, save, open, all fine.
Hi, Daniel Megert:

I just input some chinese characters inside the .java file, 
close it, then open with text editor, 
OK, no problem, the characters I input could be displayed OK.
vice verse, I create a new text in the Eclipse environment,
by New-&gt; Simple -&gt; Untitled Text File,
input some Chinese Characters, save to disk, close, open, 
also OK, no problem.

But if the file was created outside Eclipse beforehand,
It will failed by the same operation.

you right, its an encoding problem,

The problem is that if the encoding can't be determined from the file the
default is used: select the file in the Navigator or Package Exlporer and see
what encoding is used. *.properties files have ISO-8859-1 encoding per default
and hence you can't type in special chars. You can change this by changing the
default encoding for the properties file content type but that's not recommended
since Java properties files are speced to have ISO-8859-1 encoding.

Note that you can also set the default encoding on folders and files but that
changing the encodign *does not* convert existing files.

Methinks Doug needs to clean up some UI for M7. 

when is m7 sheduled?
btw: which configuration-options exactly are responsible for auto-completion?
I have not implemented auto-completion in the new content assist. I never
appreciated the completion popup in my face at seemingly random times. If
content assist was faster, it might be worth it. But for now it is not.
I'll clean up the UI for RC1. This includes paying attention to the scope. I'll
probably remove the configurability around auto-completion since I don't want to
turn it on at this point.
&gt; since I don't want to turn it on at this point.
what exactly does that mean? i'm a big fan of autocompletion (maybe i am corrupted by 
java ;-) so disabling it will definitevely keep me off from using eclipse :-(
Yes, you are spoiled by the JDT. The CDT can take up to three seconds to present
the proposals. Sometimes it's just faster to type it in yourself, in which case
auto completion will just get in your way.

If this is all that's keeping you off using Eclipse, then we've done a pretty
good job ;-)
well ... it's not really all -- the last builds i tried was really slow and ate all of my cpu, but 
this (reported already) me be fixed rather soon ... but missing autocompletion, uhh ;-)

btw: is it possible to reply to bugzilla's mails? i tried once and it didn't work but maybe i 
did something wrong.

&gt; probably remove the configurability around auto-completion since I don't want to
&gt; turn it on at this point.

I just ran across this bug myself after installing CDT M7. I can only ask that
you do NOT remove this functionality. For people who have fast machines, it's
not THAT much slower than the JDT. I think this is just a matter of preference,
and if someone doesn't like using it, they can turn it off. How about just
disabling the feature by default? I personally find it annoying to type
CTRL+SPACE every time I want content assist. 

BTW, why is it slower than JDT? Does it not use the same technology?

thanks,

Barry


No, they don't use the same technology. Java parsers generally don't parse C++.
Java doesn't have a preprocessor and, thus, inclusions. Parsing C++ is always
slower than Java, no matter what tool you are looking at.

I'll see what I can do about enabling auto-completion as an option. But for the
life of me I can't see the value in auto completion. It's faster to type the
Ctrl-Space than to wait the 500ms for auto completion to kick in, no?
But why does it have to use 500ms? You can set it to zero. Why is CTRL+SPACE
faster than typing . -&gt; or :: I don't get what you are saying at all. 

But thanks for looking into enabling it!

-Barry
This is going to be risky to fix in RC1. I'll do it right after.
O.K. Completion now only uses search when "search current project" is selected.
It actually skips by the time consuming parse in that scenario as well. But it
does leave out anything local or unsaved/unindexed. I am just waiting on 102779
to actually search the current project instead of the whole workspace.

Autoactivation has also been re-engaged.
All done. Search works quite nicely in content assist now.
Great! I will check it in RC2. BTW, is there a mailing list I can get on that
just notifies when there is a new release available?

thanks,

Barry


Nope. I'll announce on the cdt-dev list and the cdt newsgroup.</WithStack>

Load the org.eclipse.ui.tests plugin and open the UI Test Standalone View
Perspective 2. Notice that several of the views have a toolbar

The toolbar is supposed to be hidden for standalone views with no title.
Created attachment 22589
Screenshot of the bogus toolbars
If the view has toolbar contributions, they should be shown, just as with
regular views.  What was the behaviour in 3.0?

Although this may just be a miscommunication, I recall this being the intended
behavior in the original design discussions. I'm starting to feel like the
intended behavior for notitle views has become a moving target. Could we please
spell it out somewhere?

Really, I'm not making this up.  showTitle=false just means no titlebar, and no
system buttons for close etc.  If there are ISV toolbar or menu contributions,
they should be shown.  The intent is to expose the full view functionality,
except for the titlebar.
I don't think the toolbar or view menu were ever a concern for the original
driving use case (the preview pane in LWP).  Matt?
In that case, where are they supposed to go and what should they look like?
I'd vote for something as close to the regular layout as possible
E.g. in the default presentation, toolbar at top, right aligned, with view menu
to the right of that, like it would flow if they were forced to wrap for a
regular view.

Re comment #5, yes this is expected behavior and not an issue for the LWP use case.

I agree with Nick's suggestiong in comment #7.
I'd like to consider this one for RC3.

there do not seem to be any users of this (Stand-alone + toolbar), deferring to 3.2
I just want to say that i'm trying to use this feature until i found this bug
report, so please don't defer it any longer
Changing title to reflect the actual problem.  Toolbars are shown (correctly)
but are not positioned correctly.
The doc (and comments here) seem to say that toolbar and menu contributions will always be shown.  Using Build id: N20060212-0010 on Mac OS X 10.4.4, I don't see view menus and toolbars with addStandaloneView() unless I set showTitle=true.

I could not find the UI Test Standalone View Perspective 2 (looks like it was deleted?), so I tried a basic test.  Create a new plug-in project using the template "RCP application with a view".  It starts with no menus or toolbars, and uses addStandaloneView(showTitle=false).

At the bottom of View.createPartControl(), I added an Action:
   getViewSite().getActionBars().getToolBarManager().add(new Action() {
      public void run() {
         System.out.println("action activated.");
      }
   }) ;

No toolbar shows up.  Then I changed showTitle to true -- and the action shows up on the toolbar, along with what looks like a title bar (see attachment).  Given the documentation for IPageLayout and the comments here, I expected the toolbar to always be there, whether showTitle was true or false.

toolbar after setting showTitle=true
Is this still a problem in 3.3?

I performed the test described in comment 13 using 3.3 M2 (I20060922-0010) on Mac OS X 10.4.7 and Java 1.5.0.  The behavior was the same as that described in comment 13.  The action does not appear unless showTitle is set to true.

PW

I can confirm that the problem still exists as of Eclipse 3.4 M2

Boris and I both agree that if a view has declared menu and/or toolbar items that they should be available regardless of the state of the 'showTitle' flag.

What this would amount to is to use the same layout we get when the title (tab) area is too small to contain the TB and menu chevron (i.e. they show up to the right of the 'message' if there's enough space and below it otherwise.

Paul, can you confirm that this type of view still -uses- a CTabFolder?

image of toolbar in standalone project explorer

I just wanted to confirm that this is still a problem.  The attached screenshot shows the toolbar rendered on top of the view's content.  In this case I'm running eclipse 3.4 and the view is the Common Navigator's project explorer ("org.eclipse.ui.navigator.ProjectExplorer").

Are there plans to fix this?  In my use case the ideal solution would be to add a #showToolbar (the same as #showTitlebar) that would let me turn off the view's toolbar.  However, I understand that is unlikely to be the accepted solution.

The minimum solution for me is to at least render the toolbar in the proper location.  If no one is planning to work on this then I could try to find time to look into it.

build starts but it is not capable of incrementally build my workspace. Errors
remain saying "The project A cannot be built its prerequisite B is built." for
most of the projects.
- importing a second time does not fix the problem
- the projects are imported correctly: clean and full build fixes the problem

Marking as 'major' since it turns a completely fine workspace in one full of
errors and requires me to do a full build.
when autobuild is on, PDE imports the projects into the workspace and that's 
it.  PDE is totally out of the picture after that.

Resource notifications and the java builder take care of the rest.  Whether a 
build is needed and/or what kind of build is needed is totally up to the 
compiler.
Cannot reproduce with N20050608-0010 + JDT/Core HEAD.
I had two plugins from CVS jdt.core and jdt.ui ones.
I first import other required plugins and build finished normally without any
error. Then I import all other plugins and, again, build finished fine...
Can you make a second try tomorrow with N20050609-0010 build (if usable)?
Thx

mmh, maybe I misunderstood your steps but to me it looks like you performed a
completely different test case: you imported plug-ins that did not yet exist in
your workspace while I had all those plug-ins already and I re-imported them.

- did you import the required plug-ins as binary projects (not linked)?
- I have disabled all external plug-ins on the PDE Target platform pref page
- I'm just re-importing right now...
What might also be important: after the first full import of the required
plug-ins shut down and restart. Then import the existing binary projects (not
linked) again.
Re-importing once imported build X and running on X seems not to reproduce the
problem. I'll let you know tomorrow morning what happened when I started with
N20050609-0010 and import N20050609-0010.
Imported using N20050609-0010 and it worked. The difference to when I reported
this bug is that I waited several minutes until the jobs view calmed down before
importing.

Whenever I switch to a new version my workspace seems to do a (full?) build. I
was probably importing while there were still some build and/or other init jobs
running.
You're right. When I did my test, plugins I imported didn't exist in my
workspace. So, I redo some tests this morning using build N20050609-0010.

In my workspace, I initially had jdt.core and jdt.ui plugins loaded.
I performed several imports for all required plugins (40) of these jdt plugins.
Here are these imports:
1) Binary projects with linked contents
2) Binary projects
3) Projects with source folders
4) Binary projects

Of course I had set auto-build on before and if import 1) didn't override
existing plugins as they were not in my initial workspace, imports 2), 3) and 4)
are obviously re-import and look like your initial test scenario (although it
was not really obvious that it was a re-import... ;-)).

Then, I never get any problem at the end of auto-build, even if I didn't have
wait long time between each re-import.

So, I think we agree to close this as WORKSFORME

PS: The auto-build is due to new build state version number (see What's New
section in our buildnotes_jdt-core.html):
...
&lt;li&gt;The build state version number has changed. A full build of all projects in
the workspace will be triggered upon startup if autobuild is on, or on the next
build if autobuild is off.&lt;/li&gt;
...
To verify I just ran a similar scenario again without problems.</WithStack>

I have auto-build on. Until this week I could
0. have dev workspace without compile errors
1. get a new drop
2. import existing unshared plug-ins as binary projects (not linked)

    <WithStack>Apple just recently announced the move to Intel CPUs.
Please add swt-support for this new mac platform.
This feature is mission critical for our company since we need to support all
recent mac platforms.
If possible please make a prediction when macosx x86-support will be available.
I already got the universal binary, now I only need the intel hardware to try it out
(but I've ordered the transition kit...)
We are hot for this.  Andre, please keep us informed on your progress.
It just works after applying the patches from bug #100114 and after fixing (minor) bug #104892 and bug 
#104902.
Could you please share your build (universal binaries ?) with us ?
I would like to test eclipse performance on intel cpu.
Thanks
Is there a reason to hold off on providing universal binaries for the 3.2 builds?

SWT 3206d with universal binaries

This is org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc_3.1.0.jar with universal binaries for
SWT 3206d (Eclipse 3.2M2).
Just replace the original swt.jar in your Eclipse 3.2 M2 Carbon build.
You don't need a universal binary for the Eclipse launcher because Rosetta
takes care of this.

Enjoy!
Or download the universal SWT binary from here:

SWT 3210 with universal binaries

This is the universal binary for SWT 3210 of I20051018.
Since it uses HIViews in compositing mode (thereby fixing a whole slew of
bugs),
and runs very fast on MacIntel, I consider this the best SWT for MacOS X ever.
Thanks to Silenio and the SWT team!

&gt; SWT 3213 with universal binaries
&gt; 
Hi,
I have downloaded the jar files and I replace the one in eclipse plugins folder, but he don't run.
How can I do to run eclipse? Could you post a link to an eclipse build form macosx-x86?
THanks
"he don't run" doesn't provide enough information to find out what the problem is.
Is there anything in the log or the Mac Console application?
Be carefull with the revision of th e jar you replace.
SWT 3213 do not match lastest milestone 3.2M3 which use SWT 3212.

Does this happen on MacIntel?
What version of MacOS and Java VM do you have?
I've built SWT on MacOS 10.3.4 (8F1111).
My Java is:
java version "1.4.2_09"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_09-239)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-66, mixed mode)

I don't know whether this SWT runs on older version of the OS or the Java VM.
It migth be related with the version of Xcode you use to build. Since xcode 2.2
the backward compatibility is brojen.

Yes, it's a MacIntel. the version of MacOsX is 10.4.1 and the version of java is
java version "1.4.2_07"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_07-215.0.84)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-51.0.81, mixed mode)
It may be that I use MacOSX 10.4.1 and you use 10.4.3 to build swt the issue?
correction to comment #17:
the build I'm using is MacOS 10.4.3 (8F1111)  (not 10.3.4).

Has there ever been a 10.4.1 for MacIntel?
What's the build number?
(option-click on the version number in the "About this Mac" dialog).

I would like do build my own swt library, but I don't know how can I do. could you help me?
thank ENx
Todd, where's my @!#$!@#$ hardware?
You don't need the transition machine to build universal. Use XCode 2.2 to get the tools needed to generate universal binaries. We'll be happy to test them out when you generate them.
It's not just binaries.  There are Java code changes that we'd like to be able to understand/test/bless/maintain.
Re #23: Scott, I have the latest XCode, but I'm not able to build universal binaries of SWT on PowerPC.
I always have to use my macIntel for that.
I will post the error messages here...
Here is the output of building the SWT dll on PowerPC (the same builds fine on Intel).

Google to the rescue...
I searched for "Universal Binaries Makefile" and found this link:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/compiling/chapter_4_section_3.html

   CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386"
instead of
  CFLAGS="-arch ppc -arch i386"

With this the errors disappeared and the Unix "file" command lists the jnilibs now as:

libswt-carbon-3218.jnilib:        Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
libswt-carbon-3218.jnilib (for architecture ppc):       Mach-O bundle ppc
libswt-carbon-3218.jnilib (for architecture i386):      Mach-O bundle i386

I haven't tried them on MacIntel yet but they looks promising...
Created attachment 31985
waorkspace patch for make_macosx.mak

With this patch make_macosx.mak produces a universal binary on both MacIntel as well as PowerPC.
On PowerPC you need to upgrade Xcode to 2.2 and install the Universal SDK.

SWT 3213 with universal binaries (for 3.2M4)
Apple just announced at Macworld the availability of the first Intel IMac in January. I see that you managed to compile SWT as universal binaries. 
Will that platform be officially supported for the 3.2 release ?



If we could build and test it, we might consider supporting it.  We have no hardware.
You can build for Intel on PowerPC.
I can offer to test on Intel.

SWT 3219 with universal binaries

Includes fixes for bug #104892, bug #104902 and bug #122428 (Performance on OS X still degrades on 10.4.3)
In order to build a universal binary on PowerPC you have to update MacOS X with the universal SDK which is part of Xcode. The latest Xcode 2.2.1 is available from the ADC site (https://connect.apple.com/).
You'l need a free subscription which is available here:
http://developer.apple.com/membership/
I have trouble finding an official statement concerning support for intel iMacs.
I tried the latest milestone, but it didnt work. I tried to replace the 3219 SWT jar with the one attached to this bug, still the same error message.
Anything I can do about it?

I'm still experiencing the same...I was hoping the recompiled JAR would fix it for the 3.2M4 release but no such luck.  Its disconcerting that this issue is such a low one for the eclipse group.  It renders the tool completely useless on the new iMac's with Intel Core Duo CPU's.

(In reply to comment #35)
&gt; I have trouble finding an official statement concerning support for intel
&gt; iMacs.
&gt; I tried the latest milestone, but it didnt work. I tried to replace the 3219
&gt; SWT jar with the one attached to this bug, still the same error message.
&gt; Anything I can do about it?

Could you try to do a fresh install of Eclipse 3.2M4 in a new directory, and replace the SWT jar *before* you try to run Eclipse on Intel. Your problem might be a caching issue.
Great, it worked! Thanks for the hint.
I started over with a fresh install and replaced eclipse/plugins/eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc_3.2.0.v3218.jar
with the last attachment (using the same name, not sure if this is needed)

Works like a charm.
Thanks
No, the version number isn't required.
is there anything that'll work with 3.1.x?

SWT 3223 with universal binaries

FYI: I've created a Universal Binary version of another plugin containing native code:

You can find a replacement jar as attachment #3 of bug #127396.
Thanks Andre!
If I may ask, would it be possible to have a universal binary build for SWT 3139, the one thata comes with 3.1.2 ?
Cordially

3.1.2: SWT 3139 with universal binaries for Eclipse 3.1.2

Created attachment 34552
3.1.2: SWT 3139 with universal binaries for Eclipse 3.1.2

Includes fixes for bug #104892, and bug #104902
We have released temporary changes that will build universal binaries for the SWT libraries and for the eclipse launcher. For now, the SWT libraries are still in the "org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc" fragment even though they do not match the architure type.

So you should be able to run the next integration build out of the box.

The bug stays open until we decide what is the shape of our fragments. The options are:

1 fragment:
org.eclipses.swt.carbon.macosx.universal
     with libraries that are about double of the size

2 fragments:
org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc
org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.x86

3 fragments:
all of the above


My personal opinion is that the 'universal' option is the best as it most closely matches how the platform thinks about binaries and makes it more likely that other native tools for eclipse follow this model.  Further, it would be nice to use a single eclipse install on either system type.

(In reply to comment #46)
&gt; 1 fragment:
&gt; org.eclipses.swt.carbon.macosx.universal
&gt;      with libraries that are about double of the size
For what it's worth, the VM on an Intel machine returns 'ppc' as os.arch, so you won't be able to select on that. Building the SWT with both architectures in one binary is going to be the best option.
On the iMac Core Duo it returns i386 for both 1.5 and 1.4.2.  What machine and VM are you using that returns an incorrect answer?

This is news to me -- thanks for pointing it out! A colleague of mine said that we were returning 'ppc', so I took him at his word. I need to follow up on that!
Re comment #46:
I think a universal binary is the only viable option since processor architecture should be transparent for Mac users (if Eclipse is installed on shared volume, it should work for all clients).

BTW, the size size increase of the (uncompressed) libraries is &lt; 500k and the size increase of the (compressed) swt jar file is about 100k.
If someone needs smaller libraries, there are enough tools to strip off the unnecessary part.
I think the universal option would be the best, too.

Isn't it true, that eclipse wants to be as platform independent as possible?
The fragment concept was only introduced to resolve issues that could not be done well in a generic way.
So if we could merge two possible fragments (ppc &amp; x86) into one (universal), this is a step into the right direction imho.
I'm a total newbie, taking an intro java course. The course teaches us using eclipse, and I just got a intel core duo imac at home. I'd like to run eclipse on it, but I have a few questions:

1) it seems like some of you were able to get it working on your intel iMacs. Could someone please give a "dummy's version" step-by-step of how to properly intall it (with links to relevant files)

2) could I cause problems by running this "fix" - i.e. should I just wait until the next version of eclipse is released that works automatically with this new system?

3) if I should wait, any estimates of how long that would be (days? weeks? months?)

4) Are there any other IDE's that are known to work well with the intel mac that I could use in the meantime? 

PLease keep in mind I'm working with simple things here (like writing a program that prints out the value of rolled dice) as I'm just learning java  - please try to keep it simple for me.  

Thanks,
DAN
The following 3.2 Integration build works on Mac OS X X86/Intel:

http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/I20060215-0010/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-SDK-I20060215-0010-macosx-carbon.tar.gz

The 3.2 M5 stable build will run on Mac OS X X86/Intel and it should be out by Friday this week.

Will this also have support for RCP export to OSX/Intel via the Delta Pack?

-ra
Is this ready for including in the next 3.2 milestone build, which I believe would probably be M6?

Also, note that the 'Target Operating Environments' section will need to be updated in the Eclipse 3.2 project plan.
"The 3.2 M5 stable build will run on Mac OS X X86/Intel..."

This bug is not closed because we are deciding what to do about the build.
Is it possible that this update needs to look at the password control in SWT?  I'm having problems with MyEclipse IDE's DB Browser db config panel in which if I try to enter a password, the UI just flickers and does not show any characters (either plain text or the masking character, usually a fat black dot).  It becomes pretty obvious that the control is not capturing input because I get an "access denied" error when I try to access the db.  (I don't know anything about SWT, so I don't know whether there is a special control for password entry.  If there is one, was it overlooked in developing and testing this patch?)
Paul, your problem seems to be the same as bug#104902, which should be fixed in 3.2 M5. Which build are you running? If 3.2 M5, could you provide steps to reproduce it or a simple snippet that shows the problem?
*** Bug 130838 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

3.1.2  It's not possible to run MyEclipseIDE in 3.2 M&lt;x&gt;.  Is it possible that a patch can be made for 3.1.2 as was done just to get SWT running on CoreDuos iMacs (and now MacBookPros)?  I know that might be a lot of work for just a handful (if even that) users like me.

[I just read bug #104902 and it seems as though the submitter is unclear as to which version (3.2 in combo box, 3.1 in description) he is using.]
Please see comment #45 and the latest attachment.
The universal binary of SWT 3139 should solve your problem.
First of, thanks for responding. 

Second, is it correct for me to not be filtering the CC list?
I feel a bit as though I'm spamming all the folks who are
listed, and I certainly do not wish to do that.  Let me know
if I should be filtering that so no one gets upset.  Thanks.

(In reply to comment #63)
&gt; Please see comment #45 and the latest attachment.
&gt; The universal binary of SWT 3139 should solve your problem.

I can confirm that SWT 3139 doesn't because the only way I
can possibly be running 3.1.2 on a CoreDuo is to have already
patched the installation with SWT 3139.

In bug #104902, you stated, "Fixed &gt; 20060213" for 3.2 M5.  
SWT 3139 was released Feb. 12, 2006, that is, a day earlier. 

To be clear, I am in fact using SWT 3139 and that is what I am reporting
this bug against.  Here are the details I should have included 
in my first report (I wrote the following description as part of a question 
I posed in the MyEclipseIDE newgroups; it is slightly modified here to 
included the SWT 3139 info, etc.): 

****
OS X 10.4.5 
Eclipse 3.1.2 patched for Core Duo (SWT 3139, Feb. 12, 2006)
eclipse.buildId=I20051215-1506 
java.version=1.5.0_06 
MyEclipse IDE 4.10 

0. Configure DB driver in Preferences &gt; MyEclipseIDE &gt; 
Database Explorer &gt; Drivers: 

- MySQL Connector/J Driver 
- add library, mysql-connector-java-3.1.1.jar 
- driver class name is set to com.mysql.jdbc.Driver 

1. Open DB Browser view 
2. Open New Database Profile dialog 
3. Enter everything up to "Password" 
4. Type password. 

This is where the problem begins. I'd expect the UI to respond 
with a black dot, echo char for each character I type. However, 
here the cursor doesn't move to the right or show any characters. 
The UI flickers, but no text (either echo or legible characters) are 
shown in the password edit box. 

When I hit "Finish", it is perhaps no surprise that I get an 
"Access denied ...". My guess is that the password entry 
line is somehow broken (how, I don't know) and that no 
password is being sent. 

****

Hi,

We have the same problem with our application that uses the password function. We are using 3.1.2  with the patch on a iMac core duo. We use the method setEchoChar('*') of a Text control. Because of this bug, the user cannot login to the application.

Re comment #64 and #65:  
I've verified that the universal binary of SWT 3139 in fact contains my workaround for bug #104902.
However, this workaround seems only work for Text fields which are created with the SWT.PASSWORD style bit, not by calling Text.setEchoChar. Since Eclipse only uses the former (and IMO more correct) approach, I never experienced the setEchoChar problem and did not provide a workaround for that problem.

So you can either
- pass SWT.PASSWORD on Text creation and stop calling Text.setEchoChar(...), or
- call Text.setEchoChar(...) and fill the character in both byte halfs of the 16bit character,
   i.e. setEchoChar((c &lt;&lt; 8) + c)

I didn't verify the second approach myself but I think it should work.
Note that setEchoChar() is fixed in HEAD.
(In reply to comment #67)
&gt; Note that setEchoChar() is fixed in HEAD.
&gt; 
It does work with 
char cbit = (char) (('*' &lt;&lt; 8) + '*');
text.setEchoChar(cbit);
But it looks terrible on Windows. So I check the os.

It is easier to use this setEchoChar in some part of the code. But I use SWT.PASSWORD too when it is more convenient. Thanks a lot!

I am not sure if this is relevant, and I may be mistaken, but I noted that the SWT 3139 fragmnet has a bundle version of 3.1.0 when the bundle version that is delivered with Eclipse 3.1.2 is 3.1.1. Therefore I doubt that the universal binaries could ever be resolved . I am testing it soon with a ptached manifest updated with a version of 3.1.1.1

Note also that the bundle patched for SWT 3223 has some weirds quirkcs in its manifest:
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc; singleton:=tru
 e
Eclipse-PlatformFilter: (&amp; (osgi.ws=carbon) (osgi.os=macosx) (osgi.arc
 h=ppc))

Bundle-SymbolicName and Eclipse-PlatformFilter are cut and split on tow lines. I doubt that this could do any good either.
I noted that this flaw seems to be also in the manifest of the carbon swt fragment in the latest IBuild (2006-03-14) downloads, but not in head. 
Probably some quircks in the build?



Using the attachment SWT version 3139 for Eclipse 3.1.2, I am unable to start the workbench.  I get a dialog indicating that an error has occurred, and I am directed to check a log file in the eclipse/configuration directory that has the following content:

=========== end log file =============

The download is of SWT version 3.1.0 and the version with Eclipse 3.1.2 is 3.1.1 (lots of versions, there).  Is there a fixed version out there?

This is the released version of 3.1.2, if it helps.


In reply to Comment  #64 From Paul Furbacher  and
Comment  #70 From Chris Rose (Chris, BTW, next time it is better to *attach* long stack traces instead ;-) )
which were experiencing pb with the patch SWT 3139 for Eclispe 3.1.2 using attachment from  comment #45.

The patched SWT has a version number of 3.1.0. and the standard SWT is 3.1.2.
Therefore you are resolving to the old swt instead of the new one.
To get to work fine, exit eclipse, move the standard mac os swt jar (version 3.1.2) outside of your plugins dir, put the patched SWT there, and restart with an eclipse -clean.

Or alternatively, patch the manifest witha new version like 3.1.2.1(which I did but did not find appropriate to post here: send me an email if you want the patched version).

It works beautifully on a powerbook 12'' g4 and a macpookpro duo core 15'' with the exact same distro.

And while I am it: ignore my comment Comment  #69  on os.arch . The osgi.arch resolves to ppc on a macbook pro, soe everything is fine!


Thanks Andre!
Thanks for providing the universal .jnilib files.  However, there are two problems with the file java_swt in every version of the universal binaries attached to this bug:

1) it is not executable (not a big deal since you can chmod it yourself)
2) it is not compiled to be universal

I need to get a universal copy of the file java_swt so we can distribute our application to users with intel macs, any suggestions?
You don't need java_swt, and it should be removed from the SWT
distribution.  You just need to use the -XstartOnFirstThread
option to the JVM.
Created attachment 38343
Universal Binary version of Java_SWT

This is a universal binary compiled version of Java_SWT. (From r3.0 cvs branch)
While its no longer nescesary since you can get around it by specifying "StartOnMainThread"

However, for those who still want to use it... here is a unviersal version.
(In reply to comment #74)
&gt; Created an attachment (id=38343) [edit]
&gt; Universal Binary version of Java_SWT
&gt; 
&gt; This is a universal binary compiled version of Java_SWT. (From r3.0 cvs branch)

I must say....thank you very much for posting this!  Saved me a bunch of time reworking our launch configuration.

The SWT project should include this binary in their next release!  It's not necessary, but it does maintain consistency across releases.
Just a FYI, I am shipping a distro on MacOS based on 3.1.2 and we are using Andre's universal binaries from Comment  #45 .
I works beautifully. Thanks Andre!
Note that I patched the manifest so it resolves as a higher version than the standard ppc swt for 3.1.2.
I posted the universal binaries with patched manifest here if anybody is interested: 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=131065&amp;package_id=183793&amp;release_id=401995
We have decided on how the libraries/fragments should be shipped (see bug#138047), so we are done with the general issue of supporting Mac/Intel. Please open new specific bugs for any problems you find in Mac/Intel.
The attachment for 3.1.2 works great when I launch the Eclipse GUI, but when I run standalone, I get a mysterious error, bundle cannot be resolved. I have attached the stacktrace from launching with the following command.

This looks like a bug with the patched jar. I woul dlove to move to 3.2, but our product on top of Eclipse does not work with 3.2 just yet.

If this is not a bug, what am I missing?

Thanks

I can see SWTError in the jar, so why can't it find it. Permissions are OK on the file.
The patched version of the Eclipse 3.1.x works fine on Tiger. But, it does not work on Leopard and the following error happens. 

"Invalid memory access of location 9d1cd8dd eip=95e29b0c"

What can I do to solve this problem? Does a fresh compilation from the source solve this problem?
I doubt it.  There have been changes way down deep in Leopard that are causing Eclipse to crash.  We are working hard to fix them for 3.4.  I suggest you get Eclipse 3.4 M3 and see if that works for you.
Eclipse 3.2 and 3.3 works fine on leopard. 

But I work on a project that needs Eclipse 3.1, and I want to make the 3.1 version of eclipse up.
Any idea how to make it up on leopard?

I'm confused about the status of this. I haven't had any luck installing any version of Eclipse. I always get the same error indicating that the configuration file cannot be created. This is odd since it creates the log file in the indicated area.

with always the same result.

I've read this entire thread, and bug 67719 indicating to start with -configuration option. I've used gunzip/tar xvf versus stuffit. Always the same result.

I know I must be doing something really stupid due to the number of people that say Eclipse works on Mac OSX Tiger.

I already got the universal binary, now I only need the intel hardware to try it out
(but I've ordered the transition kit...)
We are hot for this.  Andre, please keep us informed on your progress.
It just works after applying the patches from bug #100114 and after fixing (minor) bug #104892 and bug 
#104902.
Could you please share your build (universal binaries ?) with us ?

SWT 3206d with universal binaries

This is org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc_3.1.0.jar with universal binaries for
SWT 3206d (Eclipse 3.2M2).
Just replace the original swt.jar in your Eclipse 3.2 M2 Carbon build.
You don't need a universal binary for the Eclipse launcher because Rosetta
takes care of this.

Enjoy!

SWT 3210 with universal binaries

This is the universal binary for SWT 3210 of I20051018.
Since it uses HIViews in compositing mode (thereby fixing a whole slew of

and runs very fast on MacIntel, I consider this the best SWT for MacOS X ever.

Hi,
I have downloaded the jar files and I replace the one in eclipse plugins folder, but he don't run.
How can I do to run eclipse? Could you post a link to an eclipse build form macosx-x86?
THanks
"he don't run" doesn't provide enough information to find out what the problem is.
Is there anything in the log or the Mac Console application?
Be carefull with the revision of th e jar you replace.
SWT 3213 do not match lastest milestone 3.2M3 which use SWT 3212.

Does this happen on MacIntel?
What version of MacOS and Java VM do you have?
I've built SWT on MacOS 10.3.4 (8F1111).
My Java is:
java version "1.4.2_09"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_09-239)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-66, mixed mode)

I don't know whether this SWT runs on older version of the OS or the Java VM.
It migth be related with the version of Xcode you use to build. Since xcode 2.2
the backward compatibility is brojen.

Yes, it's a MacIntel. the version of MacOsX is 10.4.1 and the version of java is
java version "1.4.2_07"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_07-215.0.84)

It may be that I use MacOSX 10.4.1 and you use 10.4.3 to build swt the issue?
correction to comment #17:
the build I'm using is MacOS 10.4.3 (8F1111)  (not 10.3.4).

Has there ever been a 10.4.1 for MacIntel?
What's the build number?
(option-click on the version number in the "About this Mac" dialog).

I would like do build my own swt library, but I don't know how can I do. could you help me?
thank ENx
Todd, where's my @!#$!@#$ hardware?
You don't need the transition machine to build universal. Use XCode 2.2 to get the tools needed to generate universal binaries. We'll be happy to test them out when you generate them.
It's not just binaries.  There are Java code changes that we'd like to be able to understand/test/bless/maintain.
Re #23: Scott, I have the latest XCode, but I'm not able to build universal binaries of SWT on PowerPC.
I always have to use my macIntel for that.
I will post the error messages here...
Here is the output of building the SWT dll on PowerPC (the same builds fine on Intel).

I searched for "Universal Binaries Makefile" and found this link:

   CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386"
instead of
  CFLAGS="-arch ppc -arch i386"

With this the errors disappeared and the Unix "file" command lists the jnilibs now as:

libswt-carbon-3218.jnilib:        Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
libswt-carbon-3218.jnilib (for architecture ppc):       Mach-O bundle ppc

Will that platform be officially supported for the 3.2 release ?



If we could build and test it, we might consider supporting it.  We have no hardware.
You can build for Intel on PowerPC.

Includes fixes for bug #104892, bug #104902 and bug #122428 (Performance on OS X still degrades on 10.4.3)
In order to build a universal binary on PowerPC you have to update MacOS X with the universal SDK which is part of Xcode. The latest Xcode 2.2.1 is available from the ADC site (https://connect.apple.com/).
You'l need a free subscription which is available here:

I have trouble finding an official statement concerning support for intel iMacs.

I'm still experiencing the same...I was hoping the recompiled JAR would fix it for the 3.2M4 release but no such luck.  Its disconcerting that this issue is such a low one for the eclipse group.  It renders the tool completely useless on the new iMac's with Intel Core Duo CPU's.

Could you try to do a fresh install of Eclipse 3.2M4 in a new directory, and replace the SWT jar *before* you try to run Eclipse on Intel. Your problem might be a caching issue.
Great, it worked! Thanks for the hint.
I started over with a fresh install and replaced eclipse/plugins/eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc_3.2.0.v3218.jar

No, the version number isn't required.
is there anything that'll work with 3.1.x?

If I may ask, would it be possible to have a universal binary build for SWT 3139, the one thata comes with 3.1.2 ?

Created attachment 34552
3.1.2: SWT 3139 with universal binaries for Eclipse 3.1.2

Includes fixes for bug #104892, and bug #104902
We have released temporary changes that will build universal binaries for the SWT libraries and for the eclipse launcher. For now, the SWT libraries are still in the "org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc" fragment even though they do not match the architure type.

So you should be able to run the next integration build out of the box.

The bug stays open until we decide what is the shape of our fragments. The options are:

1 fragment:
org.eclipses.swt.carbon.macosx.universal
     with libraries that are about double of the size

2 fragments:
org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc
org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.x86

3 fragments:
all of the above


My personal opinion is that the 'universal' option is the best as it most closely matches how the platform thinks about binaries and makes it more likely that other native tools for eclipse follow this model.  Further, it would be nice to use a single eclipse install on either system type.

(In reply to comment #46)
&gt; 1 fragment:
&gt; org.eclipses.swt.carbon.macosx.universal
&gt;      with libraries that are about double of the size
For what it's worth, the VM on an Intel machine returns 'ppc' as os.arch, so you won't be able to select on that. Building the SWT with both architectures in one binary is going to be the best option.
On the iMac Core Duo it returns i386 for both 1.5 and 1.4.2.  What machine and VM are you using that returns an incorrect answer?

This is news to me -- thanks for pointing it out! A colleague of mine said that we were returning 'ppc', so I took him at his word. I need to follow up on that!
Re comment #46:
I think a universal binary is the only viable option since processor architecture should be transparent for Mac users (if Eclipse is installed on shared volume, it should work for all clients).

BTW, the size size increase of the (uncompressed) libraries is &lt; 500k and the size increase of the (compressed) swt jar file is about 100k.
If someone needs smaller libraries, there are enough tools to strip off the unnecessary part.
I think the universal option would be the best, too.

Isn't it true, that eclipse wants to be as platform independent as possible?
The fragment concept was only introduced to resolve issues that could not be done well in a generic way.
So if we could merge two possible fragments (ppc &amp; x86) into one (universal), this is a step into the right direction imho.
I'm a total newbie, taking an intro java course. The course teaches us using eclipse, and I just got a intel core duo imac at home. I'd like to run eclipse on it, but I have a few questions:

1) it seems like some of you were able to get it working on your intel iMacs. Could someone please give a "dummy's version" step-by-step of how to properly intall it (with links to relevant files)

2) could I cause problems by running this "fix" - i.e. should I just wait until the next version of eclipse is released that works automatically with this new system?

3) if I should wait, any estimates of how long that would be (days? weeks? months?)

4) Are there any other IDE's that are known to work well with the intel mac that I could use in the meantime? 

PLease keep in mind I'm working with simple things here (like writing a program that prints out the value of rolled dice) as I'm just learning java  - please try to keep it simple for me.  

Thanks,
DAN
The following 3.2 Integration build works on Mac OS X X86/Intel:

http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/I20060215-0010/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-SDK-I20060215-0010-macosx-carbon.tar.gz

The 3.2 M5 stable build will run on Mac OS X X86/Intel and it should be out by Friday this week.

Will this also have support for RCP export to OSX/Intel via the Delta Pack?

-ra
Is this ready for including in the next 3.2 milestone build, which I believe would probably be M6?

Also, note that the 'Target Operating Environments' section will need to be updated in the Eclipse 3.2 project plan.
"The 3.2 M5 stable build will run on Mac OS X X86/Intel..."

This bug is not closed because we are deciding what to do about the build.
Is it possible that this update needs to look at the password control in SWT?  I'm having problems with MyEclipse IDE's DB Browser db config panel in which if I try to enter a password, the UI just flickers and does not show any characters (either plain text or the masking character, usually a fat black dot).  It becomes pretty obvious that the control is not capturing input because I get an "access denied" error when I try to access the db.  (I don't know anything about SWT, so I don't know whether there is a special control for password entry.  If there is one, was it overlooked in developing and testing this patch?)
Paul, your problem seems to be the same as bug#104902, which should be fixed in 3.2 M5. Which build are you running? If 3.2 M5, could you provide steps to reproduce it or a simple snippet that shows the problem?
*** Bug 130838 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

3.1.2  It's not possible to run MyEclipseIDE in 3.2 M&lt;x&gt;.  Is it possible that a patch can be made for 3.1.2 as was done just to get SWT running on CoreDuos iMacs (and now MacBookPros)?  I know that might be a lot of work for just a handful (if even that) users like me.

[I just read bug #104902 and it seems as though the submitter is unclear as to which version (3.2 in combo box, 3.1 in description) he is using.]
Please see comment #45 and the latest attachment.
The universal binary of SWT 3139 should solve your problem.
First of, thanks for responding. 

Second, is it correct for me to not be filtering the CC list?
I feel a bit as though I'm spamming all the folks who are
listed, and I certainly do not wish to do that.  Let me know
if I should be filtering that so no one gets upset.  Thanks.

(In reply to comment #63)
&gt; Please see comment #45 and the latest attachment.
&gt; The universal binary of SWT 3139 should solve your problem.

I can confirm that SWT 3139 doesn't because the only way I
can possibly be running 3.1.2 on a CoreDuo is to have already
patched the installation with SWT 3139.

In bug #104902, you stated, "Fixed &gt; 20060213" for 3.2 M5.  
SWT 3139 was released Feb. 12, 2006, that is, a day earlier. 

To be clear, I am in fact using SWT 3139 and that is what I am reporting
this bug against.  Here are the details I should have included 
in my first report (I wrote the following description as part of a question 
I posed in the MyEclipseIDE newgroups; it is slightly modified here to 
included the SWT 3139 info, etc.): 

****
OS X 10.4.5 
Eclipse 3.1.2 patched for Core Duo (SWT 3139, Feb. 12, 2006)
eclipse.buildId=I20051215-1506 
java.version=1.5.0_06 
MyEclipse IDE 4.10 

0. Configure DB driver in Preferences &gt; MyEclipseIDE &gt; 
Database Explorer &gt; Drivers: 

- MySQL Connector/J Driver 
- add library, mysql-connector-java-3.1.1.jar 
- driver class name is set to com.mysql.jdbc.Driver 

1. Open DB Browser view 
2. Open New Database Profile dialog 
3. Enter everything up to "Password" 
4. Type password. 

This is where the problem begins. I'd expect the UI to respond 
with a black dot, echo char for each character I type. However, 
here the cursor doesn't move to the right or show any characters. 
The UI flickers, but no text (either echo or legible characters) are 
shown in the password edit box. 

When I hit "Finish", it is perhaps no surprise that I get an 
"Access denied ...". My guess is that the password entry 
line is somehow broken (how, I don't know) and that no 
password is being sent. 

****

Hi,

We have the same problem with our application that uses the password function. We are using 3.1.2  with the patch on a iMac core duo. We use the method setEchoChar('*') of a Text control. Because of this bug, the user cannot login to the application.

Re comment #64 and #65:  
I've verified that the universal binary of SWT 3139 in fact contains my workaround for bug #104902.
However, this workaround seems only work for Text fields which are created with the SWT.PASSWORD style bit, not by calling Text.setEchoChar. Since Eclipse only uses the former (and IMO more correct) approach, I never experienced the setEchoChar problem and did not provide a workaround for that problem.

So you can either
- pass SWT.PASSWORD on Text creation and stop calling Text.setEchoChar(...), or
- call Text.setEchoChar(...) and fill the character in both byte halfs of the 16bit character,
   i.e. setEchoChar((c &lt;&lt; 8) + c)

I didn't verify the second approach myself but I think it should work.
Note that setEchoChar() is fixed in HEAD.
(In reply to comment #67)
&gt; Note that setEchoChar() is fixed in HEAD.
&gt; 
It does work with 
char cbit = (char) (('*' &lt;&lt; 8) + '*');
text.setEchoChar(cbit);
But it looks terrible on Windows. So I check the os.

It is easier to use this setEchoChar in some part of the code. But I use SWT.PASSWORD too when it is more convenient. Thanks a lot!

I am not sure if this is relevant, and I may be mistaken, but I noted that the SWT 3139 fragmnet has a bundle version of 3.1.0 when the bundle version that is delivered with Eclipse 3.1.2 is 3.1.1. Therefore I doubt that the universal binaries could ever be resolved . I am testing it soon with a ptached manifest updated with a version of 3.1.1.1

Note also that the bundle patched for SWT 3223 has some weirds quirkcs in its manifest:
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc; singleton:=tru
 e
Eclipse-PlatformFilter: (&amp; (osgi.ws=carbon) (osgi.os=macosx) (osgi.arc
 h=ppc))

Bundle-SymbolicName and Eclipse-PlatformFilter are cut and split on tow lines. I doubt that this could do any good either.
I noted that this flaw seems to be also in the manifest of the carbon swt fragment in the latest IBuild (2006-03-14) downloads, but not in head. 
Probably some quircks in the build?

The download is of SWT version 3.1.0 and the version with Eclipse 3.1.2 is 3.1.1 (lots of versions, there).  Is there a fixed version out there?

This is the released version of 3.1.2, if it helps.


In reply to Comment  #64 From Paul Furbacher  and
Comment  #70 From Chris Rose (Chris, BTW, next time it is better to *attach* long stack traces instead ;-) )
which were experiencing pb with the patch SWT 3139 for Eclispe 3.1.2 using attachment from  comment #45.

The patched SWT has a version number of 3.1.0. and the standard SWT is 3.1.2.
Therefore you are resolving to the old swt instead of the new one.
To get to work fine, exit eclipse, move the standard mac os swt jar (version 3.1.2) outside of your plugins dir, put the patched SWT there, and restart with an eclipse -clean.

Or alternatively, patch the manifest witha new version like 3.1.2.1(which I did but did not find appropriate to post here: send me an email if you want the patched version).

It works beautifully on a powerbook 12'' g4 and a macpookpro duo core 15'' with the exact same distro.

And while I am it: ignore my comment Comment  #69  on os.arch . The osgi.arch resolves to ppc on a macbook pro, soe everything is fine!


Thanks Andre!
Thanks for providing the universal .jnilib files.  However, there are two problems with the file java_swt in every version of the universal binaries attached to this bug:

1) it is not executable (not a big deal since you can chmod it yourself)
2) it is not compiled to be universal

I need to get a universal copy of the file java_swt so we can distribute our application to users with intel macs, any suggestions?
You don't need java_swt, and it should be removed from the SWT
distribution.  You just need to use the -XstartOnFirstThread
option to the JVM.

Universal Binary version of Java_SWT

This is a universal binary compiled version of Java_SWT. (From r3.0 cvs branch)
While its no longer nescesary since you can get around it by specifying "StartOnMainThread"

However, for those who still want to use it... here is a unviersal version.

&gt; This is a universal binary compiled version of Java_SWT. (From r3.0 cvs branch)

I must say....thank you very much for posting this!  Saved me a bunch of time reworking our launch configuration.

The SWT project should include this binary in their next release!  It's not necessary, but it does maintain consistency across releases.
Just a FYI, I am shipping a distro on MacOS based on 3.1.2 and we are using Andre's universal binaries from Comment  #45 .
I works beautifully. Thanks Andre!
Note that I patched the manifest so it resolves as a higher version than the standard ppc swt for 3.1.2.
I posted the universal binaries with patched manifest here if anybody is interested: 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=131065&amp;package_id=183793&amp;release_id=401995
We have decided on how the libraries/fragments should be shipped (see bug#138047), so we are done with the general issue of supporting Mac/Intel. Please open new specific bugs for any problems you find in Mac/Intel.
The attachment for 3.1.2 works great when I launch the Eclipse GUI, but when I run standalone, I get a mysterious error, bundle cannot be resolved. I have attached the stacktrace from launching with the following command.

This looks like a bug with the patched jar. I woul dlove to move to 3.2, but our product on top of Eclipse does not work with 3.2 just yet.

If this is not a bug, what am I missing?

I can see SWTError in the jar, so why can't it find it. Permissions are OK on the file.
The patched version of the Eclipse 3.1.x works fine on Tiger. But, it does not work on Leopard and the following error happens. 

"Invalid memory access of location 9d1cd8dd eip=95e29b0c"

What can I do to solve this problem? Does a fresh compilation from the source solve this problem?
I doubt it.  There have been changes way down deep in Leopard that are causing Eclipse to crash.  We are working hard to fix them for 3.4.  I suggest you get Eclipse 3.4 M3 and see if that works for you.
Eclipse 3.2 and 3.3 works fine on leopard. 

But I work on a project that needs Eclipse 3.1, and I want to make the 3.1 version of eclipse up.

    <WithStack>Hello,
I would suggest an improvement of the breakpoint feature in debugging.
We could have the following behavior , ie a breakpoint which doesn't stop when
the condition is reached, but which on display an expression on the console.
For example, I could have "displaypoint" set on a specific line of my programm,
and whenever this line is reached, I could display in the console or expression
view a result combining variables visible at this point...
Obviously we could do that with AJDT, but it is too complicated for only this
feature.
regards
Xavier
You can do it now with a conditional breakpoint. Create an condition like

System.out.println("something");
return false;

The breakpoint will not suspend as the "condition" is false.

    <WithStack>The number of rows fetched from database should be limitted when creating or
modifying a datasource.

Currently it seems like BIRT is retrieving all the rows from the table, and (in
our scenario) it's a huge table. As the row fetching blocks user operations, it
impacts usability quite badly (maybe the rows could be displayed from a
background worker thread?).

It should be an option on the BIRT preferences page.

A similar option should be available for limiting the number of rows retrieved
while previewing the report (with a button per datasource to "Show all", if
there are more rows than those shown).
Moved to 1.0.1 as a requested improvement.
Added keywords.
Data set preview already limits result set to first 500 rows. Can you please
verify if this is working for you?

The suggested enhancements make sense. The preview row limit should be user
configurable. It will also be nice to add a "More rows" or "Show all" button in
the preview pane.
Sorry, the data displayed is certainly not the full table contents.

However, BIRT is very slow retrieving the preview data, and the usability issues
remain.

Using another tool (DBVisualizer) to query the table, limitting the result to
30.000 tuples, it takes about 20 seconds (during which, a counter is updated
every 100 tuples, so the user knows that the app is working).

Using BIRT preview, it takes more than 4 minutes for 500 tuples, with no
perceived progress and freezing Eclipse.

For the record, the table contains 36 columns, 30 of them are VARCHAR(50), 3 are
TIMESTAMP and 3 are BIGINT. Most of the VARCHARs are NULL. The table has a total
of 30.747.214 rows.

I'm changing the title to something more relevant.

A couple more questions:
(1) Did you run identical SQLs when you compare BIRT preview performance with
DBVisualizer? Does DBVisualizer use JDBC, and if so is it using the same JDBC
drivers as BIRT?
(2) Can you attach the content of the SQL that runs slowly to this bug?
(3) What's the Java VM heap size setting you use to start Eclipse? Does the
performance problem persist if you double the heap size?  (Use the "-vmargs
-Xmx512m" argument on Eclipse command line to set heap size to 512MB for example).


Sorry for the late response...

I've traced this to a parameter in the conection string. My DB is an SQLServer
(with the MS provided JDBC driver) and I was using the parameter
"connectionMethod=cursor" with DBVisualizer, but not with BIRT.

This parameter changes between the way data is sent to the client. With "cursor"
method, the preview runs much faster.

The difference is that "cursor" opens a DB cursor which is used to read the data
under demand. If it is not specified, de DB feeds the whole data to the client
(so it doesn't care how many rows are actually read).

(I'm not 100% sure of my own explanation, but the point is that, with similar
conenction strings, BIRT preview and DBVisualizer run with equivalent response
times).

I'm marking the bug as INVALID.

For the record, I'll answer the questions you asked:

(In reply to comment #4)

  Yes.

  Yes.

  I'll paste it, as it is really simple...

  It was already set at that level.

The difference is that "And thanks for all the fish!" is printed twice for the

Oops ! Thanks for finding this.
This only occurs when performing JSR inline (like in compliant 1.5 mode).
Problem comes from an exception attribute range which comprises the inlined
finally block, thus in case of exception, it gets trapped and activates the any
exception handler (second invocation of the finally block).
Added TryStatementTest#test027-028.

Fixed by exit/entering subroutine code when performing inlining of finally block
at exit locations in code.

Fixed

Tobias, we have to understand this one.
Stefan, can you provide a concrete example?
OK, found one:

The new transparent icons are not correctly handled on the Linux-GTK platform.
The icons in the task bar and the task switcher (Alt+TAB) are not rendered with
transparency. Will attach a screenshot.
Created attachment 22593
transparent.png

Screenshot of my task switcher.

The currently selected window is the Gimp window for the eclipse48.png file
showing correct transparency - so it is possible to get it right.

To its right is the icon for the eclipse window. Note the white and black
borders to to converted transparency areas.

Feels at least major for me as shipping this looks really bad.
This should probably go to SWT.
mvm: which file is being used on GTK+?  Is it the .ico or the .png files?
As of last night 2005 06 08 should be ICO files everywhere but the Mac.  I
understood from SN that this was supported.
The problem is that ICO files with alpha are only supported on XP and GTK (and 
we have a bug that is preventing GTK from working).  The GTK bug may be fixed 
after RC2.  We are working to solve the general problem for Eclipse by making 
Shell.setImages() smarter for RC2.  Stand by.
*** Bug 98985 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 98933 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This bug has been used to track the badness of the icons in the Eclipse window
which was solved by making Shell.setImages() smarter.  I have opened bug 99253
about the specific issue of ico files with alpha on GTK+.
This was fixed by SN and SSQ for the 4pm build today.
If this bug is tracking the recent icon cheeze, then this is still a problem on
windows XP in RC3.

The icon in the window title is fixed, but the icon on the task bar is still
badly stretched.
Isn't "cheeze" is spelled "cheese".  Anyhow, can you attach a screen shot of 
the badness?
Stefan, gotta see the badness in XP in RC3 before proceeding because this 
WORKSFORME.  Got a gif?
Somehow, Shell.setImages() was not fixed for the Mac.  The other problems have 
been fixed.
The cheeze I'm seeing seems to only occur with 16-bit colour and the 120-DPI
(large size) setting.

I've reproduced on a MvM's machine, although the cheeze was different. Seems to
be the combination of 120DPI and 16-bit colour that does it.
The cheeze seems to depend on the colour depth of the windows primary monitor,
not the monitor containing the start bar.

If I make my AGP card into the primary display (through windows - not the bios)
and change its colour depth to 32, the problem goes away on both monitors.
when I increase the DPI setting for my graphics card on my laptop to 120 I see
this behaviour as well.
Shell.setImages() has been fixed on the Mac.
Is this now fixed?
Yes, it was fixed on the Mac.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>I've defined a new JDBC Driver for SQL Server, and created a DataSource from it.
The data preview works fine while creating/editing the datasource.

I then create a table in my empty report by dragging the datasource into the editor.

Then I switch to the Preview tab, and after a few seconds an error is displayed:
--
There are errors on the report page:Error1:No se puede abrir la conexi&amp;#1091;n del
controlador (org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc).Cannot load JDBC Driver
class: [com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver]. Cannot load JDBC Driver
class: [com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver]. 
--

It seems like the required jars are not included in the classpath for the report
editor...

I've installed BIRT in a new "site", instead of copying it directly over my
eclipse instalation.
The most likely cause is that the JDBC driver has not been installed in the
viewer plugin directory. Check the following directory. Do you see your JDBC
driver there? If not you will need to manually copy that driver's JAR files to
this location for report preview to work:

\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer_1.0.0\birt\WEB-INF\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc\drivers


That was the cause (missing drivers).

However, it is quite confusing as I've been able to select JARs from anywhere
while creating the datasource, and I have already been able to see the data in
the preview.

I think a tighter integration between components of BIRT is a must (at the very
least, automatically copy the JAR files selected while creating the datasource
into that folder).

Is this being worked on? (I find no relevant bug report).
How did you initially add your JDBC driver to BIRT? Did you use the "Manage
Drivers" wizard (accessed from the button with the same name in the New Data
Source dialog for JDBC data sources)? This wizard is supposed to take care of
this for you - it should have copied the JAR files to all necessary locations.
Yes, I used the wizard.

I'm using a different site for installing BIRT as described, for instance, on
http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t18678.html (i.e. I've not copied it over
my eclipse installation).

That might be the reason why the jar files have not been copied to the right
location (which seems to be the BIRT site, not the Eclipse main installation).

The folder does not exist on my Eclipse installation, it has not been created
and it has not reported an error, or I don't rememeber it... I'll check again
and report here.
There are 3 *.jar files with com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.If you use wizard to 
add the jdbc drivers, you must add all of them. If You cannot find the copy of 
these jar files in \eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer_1.0.0
\birt\WEB-INF\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc\drivers, You can 
manually copy them under this file. This can make the preview work. If there 
still has this problem , please reopen this bug.

Steps to reproduce:
- Have a Java working set in the package explorer, containing the following 4 
projects:
  - org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring (imported, binary, linked)
  - org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring.tests (source, shared)
  - org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring (imported, binary, linked)
  - org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring.tests (source, shared)

When selecting the working set and invoking the context menu, all team 
contributions are missing

-&gt; Team contributions should be available for heterogeneous selections as well.
The best we can do here is to have Team operations when the selection contains 
some shared with the same repository type (CVS in this case) and others not 
shared at all. This already supported.

The reason for this is that, if there is two repositories involved, the Team 
menu will contain the commands from two repository types. The bad news is that 
PDE uses a repository provider for binary projects so the CVS operations do 
not appear for you.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Eclipse 3.1RC1 (It happens also in Eclipse 3.0.2)

After synchronizing with CVS, the result remains in progress view. It shows
"finished". But after closing progress view and opening it again, the result is
changed to "unfinished". The progress indicator stops in 75% and "Cancel Task"
button appears instead of "Remove Task". The result cannot be removed by "Remove
All Finised Tasks".

Image of "progress view"

The several results remains unfinised.
Do they remain unfinished indefinitely or do they eventually finish (i.e. if you
look at the view 1 hour later are they still unfinished)?
They seem to remain indefinitely.
I've waited for 1 hour. But they remain "unfinished" in progress view.

The operation is as following.
1. "Synchronize" with CVS repository. In "progress view" the result shows
"finished".
2. Close "progress view".
3. Open "progress view".
4. The result is changed to "unfinished" in "progress view".

Do you reproduce it?
I've seen it occasionally as well. One case I have seen involves a case where 
the synchronize view takes a long time to update after the remote part of the 
synchronize is finished. In this case the entry in the Progress view does 
eventually finish. It is possible that, in your case, the Progress view has a 
stale entry that it is showing. I believe that work is planned for 3.2 in this 
area.

I have it also often, happening about every third time I'm doing a CVS synchronize.

Eclipse 3.1.0 (I20050627-1435), Windows XP.


I can confirm that this is still a problem with 3.1.2 M20060118-1600 on Windows XP SP2.

From the screen shots, this appears to be an issue with the Progress view (i.e. entries are being duplicated and left around).
I agree. Running it through the debugger confirms that all worker threads are idle, so it's not actually doing anything.
This was fixed in 3.3</WithStack>

    <WithStack>The current formatter line wrapping doesn't do what my "non-using eclipse"
co-workers expect :)
For example, they prefer to have operators like "+" to be located before an
expression wrapping, rather than at the beginning of the next line.
If I disable all the wrappings options (for all elements), and if I wrap
manually the lines, then after a format, Eclipse automatically merges the
manually wrapped lines...
The formatter is a nice feature and it's useful apart from wrapping. What I
suggest, is an option in the formatter, which would let the user works with it:
the formatter would only format the lines (with contents) that are given (or
already wrapped by the users). It can wrap if needed, but cannot merge lines.

    <WithStack>This issue was previously reported as Bug#96766 on 3.1M7. A fix was applied and
released in 3.1RC1. However the fix is only partial and there is still a problem.

The cause of this issue is the logic in the getLinkText() method of
JavaStackTraceHyperlink.java. This method is intended to return a substring from
a line which contains a link. The substring should be the link text. 

The logic does not correctly detect the end of the link text and so if there is
additional text on the line, following the link, this is erroneously returned as
part of the link text. This subsequently causes line number parsing to fail.

The following code illustrates the problem and provides replacement logic for
getLinkText() which would fix the problem:

public class Tst {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println("Click on these links to see the problem:");
        System.out.println("xxxx Tst.main(Tst.java:5) works");
        System.out.println("xxxx Tst.main(Tst.java:7) fails (\n");
       
        System.out.println("See how existing code fails to substring the link
correctly:");
        System.out.println("Existing getLinkText: '"+a("xxxx
Tst.main(Tst.java:7) works")+"'");
        System.out.println("Existing getLinkText: '"+a("xxxx
Tst.main(Tst.java:7) fails (")+"'\n");

        System.out.println("See how proposed code correctly substrings the link:");
        System.out.println("Proposed getLinkText: '"+b("xxxx
Tst.main(Tst.java:7) works")+"'");
        System.out.println("Proposed getLinkText: '"+b("xxxx
Tst.main(Tst.java:7) fails (")+"'");
    }
    
    // Existing getLinkText returns from start of link to end of line
    public static String a(final String line) {

        int paren = line.lastIndexOf("("); //$NON-NLS-1$
        String upToParen = line.substring(0, paren);
        int index = upToParen.lastIndexOf(' ');
        return line.substring(index+1);            
    }

    // Proposed fix returns *only* the link text
    public static String b(final String line) {

        int linkMiddle = line.indexOf(".java:"); 
        int linkStart = line.lastIndexOf(' ',linkMiddle);
        int linkEnd = line.indexOf(')',linkMiddle);
        return line.substring(linkStart==-1?0:linkStart+1,linkEnd+1);            
    }
}
