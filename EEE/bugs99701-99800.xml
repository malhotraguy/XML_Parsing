    <WithStack>Files in ...\3.1.0 RC2\plugins\org.apache.ant_1.6.4\bin have unix-style line 
terminators (\n) instead of windows {\r\n) for a win2k install.

This causes an error when running ant (which calls ant.bat): 

    The system cannot find the batch label specified - end
Thank you for the bug report.

We are planning to move to Ant 1.6.5 shortly and I will ensure that correct 
line delimiters.
+1
Verified that the problem existed with our bat file.

Went through and converted the line delimiters on all of the files in 
org.apache.ant/bin ... then the Eclipse team support does the rest.

Thanks again Derek.
Please verify DarinW.
Not fixed...
Michael I am at a loss on how to fix this one...thought I would ping you for some insight.
I think the problem is that all SDK builds (Unix, Windows, Mac) happen on Unix and hence all the ASCII files involved end up with Unix style line feeds. Sonia, can you confirm that all builds happen on Windows?
If all builds do happen on UNIX is there a way to mark a file to not have the line delimiters converted?
You could make the bat file Binary. This would prevent any line-ending conversions from happening. You would need to re-commit the file in order to introduce the CRLF line endings to the file again.
Thanks for the help...plan to convert to binary.

Am I correct in that after the line conversion, no outgoing changes show?
Yes but when converting to Binary, I don't think the file contents are modified in any way so there wouldn't be any outgoing changes. You may need to touch the file and then commit it to change the line endings on the server.
Re: comment #7, the build occurs on a single Linux box.
I have converted the files to binary and have attempted to correctly release no-op changes to force the correct line delims for the various files.
Testing with eclipse-sdk-n20060121-0010-win32 this appears to finally be working as expected. Thanks all.
Please verify Kevin.

    <WithStack>Right now launch configuration for an Eclipse application, when stored in a
file, uses platform dependent path separator to separate plugins to be launched.
This makes it impossible to share the configuration between different platforms.
This problem may affect other types of launch configurations as well.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 86796 ***
I really don't think this is a duplicate of bug 86796. Bug 86796 is about string
substitution variables, while this bug is not affected by these variables in any
way. Note also that the workspace location parameter works exactly as expected
by the user i.e. it is saved and restored from the file correctly on different
platforms, so bug 86796 is simly an enhancement. On the other hand the list of
plugins to be launched is not restored correctly on a different platform
(resulting in an empty selection), because it assumes that both platforms use
the same path separator.

Although both bugs aim to make the launch configuration more portable, I think
this bug could be addressed separately by replacing File.pathSeparatorChar with
a fixed character during save and replacing that fixed character with
File.pathSeparatorChar during load. Please consider reopening it.
oh you're right. reopening.
*** Bug 99965 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Adjusting severity to major because it makes all our launch configs (that we were creating for cross 
platform tests) worthless.
Fixed.  The delimiter is now ','.  We will provide backward compatibility for 
all existing launch configs.
Great! Thanks Wassim.
This ends a nightmare for all Mac developers!
(and I still believe the fix was trivial...)
the fix for this particular defect was indeed trivial.

However, to make your launch configurations 100% portable required more work 
(support for variable substitutions, etc.).  It will all be in 3.2M2</WithStack>

    <WithStack>Currently the Java Editor allows a user to customize templates: a quickly
accessible snippets of text that can be dynamically populated with variables
that capture the context of the editor. For example a user can type in systr and
hit Ctrl-Space to autocomplete which will create a System.out.println() call
with the text of the current method in the editor.

It would be very helpful if a line number variable was added to the list of the
variables already available: it would greatly simplify addition of logging
statements to existing code.
Those line numbers would be outdated very quickly.
There are currently no plans to add this.
Get rid of deprecated state.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>org.eclipse.jem.internal.beaninfo.vm.ModelingBeanInfo.stripList() should not
reuse the FeatureDescriptorEquality classes because this can lead to a
ClassCastException in IndexedPropertyDescriptorEquality.

If the first property of a list is a indexed property, the , this leads to a
ClassCastException in IndexedPropertyFeatureEquality if the property compared is
not an indexed property.
Sorry, accidently commited too early.

The ClassCastException happens in the IndexedPropertyDescriptorEquality.equals. 

We can get indexed properties in our list because we collect all properties with
introspection In our base bean info class. We configure them (set to
hidden/expert, add enumeration values etc.) in the concrete bean info classes.
In one class now it happens to be the case that the first property found is an
indexed property, so the  FeatureDescriptorEquality class used as a working copy
for the full list is an IndexedPropertyDescriptorEquality. 

After the ClassCastException the whole BeanInfo is not read which leads to
missing properties in the Property Sheet.



I don't want to keep recreating the working copies. What I should do is instead
have only IndexedPropertyFeatureEquality and have it understand that it may
wrapper only a Property and not an Indexed property.

Thanks for bring this to my attention.
The fix has been released to HEAD.
VE 1.1 is released. Moving to closed.</WithStack>

e.g.

* breakpoint 1

Working Set B
* breakpoint 3
Working Set C
* breakpoint 4
 
- drag breakpoint 2 and drop it between breakpoint 3 and Working Set C.

Result:
Breakpoint 2 is grouped under Working Set C.

Expected Result:
Breakpoint 2 should be grouped under Working Set B since it was dropped under 
Working Set B.

Similarly, if you move Breakpoint 2 from Working Set C, and put it between 
Breakpoint 3 and Working Set C again, the breakpoint will not move.
This may be a drag &amp; drop bug - the mouse has to be over group C for this to 
happen, althought the "drop line" is shown before group C.

AbstractTextEditor calls setInput(null) in its dispose method.  This is a
violation of the specification for that method, and leads to a violation of
IEditorPart.getEditorInput() as well.

Platform UI would like to add an assert to the setInput(IEditorInput) method to
prevent misuse of this API.  Before we can do this, Platform Text will need to
remove the call.

Unless, of course, there is some reason why this call needs to be made (e.g.,
memory leak)?

This problem is caused by the XML encoding of the pluginconfig.xml file of 
org.eclipse.hyades.perfmon.jmxagent plugin.  It is UTF-8.  However, the file is 
in EBCDIC encoding so the XML encoding string in the file must be an EBCDIC 
codepage, for example ibm-1047-s390.

Either the XML encoding string in the file must be changed or if this plugin is 
not supported on z/OS, then the org.eclipse.hyades.perfmon.jmxagent plugin 
should not be included in the Agent Controller packaging for z/OS.

The driver this problem was found in was TPTP 3.3.0_20050613_0754.
I checked a fix into 4.0 for this, and, as it was not marked critical or
blocking by kent I wasn't able to get the fix into the 3.3 build. The fix was to
no longer use a static pluginconfig but to generate one using the rac plugin
extensions.

I have thought about this, and as far as I can tell, JOnAS and JBoss (although I
have not fully investigated the latter) are not servers that have full Z/OS
support. There is no reason why they cannot be made to run though. 

I don't feel overly confident in checking any changes into 3.3, and in the light
that the server are not support I think it would be best if the agent support
was removed for z/OS.

Does that sound reasonable to you?
I am marking this as a duplicate of Kent's bug 94594. This got moved to TPTP 4.0
as per request on a platform call, and was subsequently fixed in 4.0.

test snippet for CCombo

Created a snippet to understand the problem.

It has a very long text as one of the items in the List.

On running the snippet, we can see that the vertical drop-down arrow and part of the window is out of the screen.
We can either maximize the window or drag the window to bring the drop-down arrow into view. But, I'm not sure if this is a problem. I saw the same behavior with native Combo on windows. 
Carolyn, please tell me if this behavior has to be fixed?

The real problem I think is that when we click on the drop-down, the items are not in view and there is no horizontal scrollbar to bring them back into view and no way to scroll through the entire long String.
This scenario works fine for native Combo, the list items are in view and a horizontal scroll-bar is created.
I agree that we do not need to fix the drop-down arrow being off to the side.
In addition to dragging or maximizing the window, the user can type ALT+down arrow to drop down the list.

However, as you noticed, there is no horizontal scroll bar. I think we should add one when it is needed, to be consistent with Combo. A work-around is for the user to select the item, and then they can see the entire text of the item by drag-scrolling in the CCombo. However, having an "as-needed" horizontal scrollbar is the best solution.

Here's a new snippet (I had to make the text longer because I have a fairly large monitor &lt;g&gt;). Please make sure that the horizontal scrollbar works with SWT.READ_ONLY style as well - thanks!

patch with code changes

Created patch with the changes for the fix.

The horizontal scroll-bar was not showing up because:
1) The SWT.H_SCROLL style-bit was not being set for the List in CCombo. 
Patch fixes this by setting the SWT.H_SCROLL for the list by default. The user cannot set or unset this style-bit for CCombo (similar to Combo).

2) The size of combo is computed based on the size of the list and so that it fits into the screen. When user selects the drop-down list, the size of the list is computed again and its width is set to max of list width and combo width. So, for long text, the list goes out of the screen and the horizontal scroll-bar is not shown. 
Patch fixes this by setting the width of the pop-up list equal to the Combo width. Now, the pop-up list will not show-up wider than the Combo. Also, horizontal scroll-bar will show-up when required.
This is good, but when the CCombo's width is set small, then the list is too small, and it does not have to be.

Notice that Combo behaves in a nice way when text in the list is wide, but not wider than the screen. To see this, here is a slightly modified snippet that sets the size of a Combo instead of letting it take its preferred size:

new patch with code changes

Attached the modified patch.

I checked the behavior of native Combo in Windows and how the drop-down list width is computed for Combo in Windows. 

In Windows native Combo, 
1)The list appears without scroll-bar if its width less than "max width". 
2)Horizontal scroll-bar is shown only when list width is greater than combo width and "max width".
3)"max width" is computed based on the monitor width.
4)Combo width is used for list width if it is bigger than the list width.
Modified the patch to compute the drop-down list of CCombo similarly. 

There is one difference. In native Combo, when list width is greater than combo width and "max width" and horizontal scroll-bar appears, list width is set to width of the second widest item in the list.
But, in the patch, for the same case, horizontal scroll-bar appears and list width is set to "max width". 
I think getting the above behavior of Combo in CCombo will require more computations during each drop-down action.

I'm fixing Bug 377155 so thought of fixing this too as its in the same code.

The native Combo behavior on Windows seems to have changed on Windows 7, the horizontal scrollbar doesn't appear for long text and it behaves like CCombo.

The fix just shows the horizontal scrollbar when the list exceeds the screen width.
The fix is similar to patch in comment#6, but uses the display width instead of max width.

    <WithStack>With the current plugin dependency it is impossible to separate the Log Viewer 
or statistical data viwers in a low level feature, to be available only when 
data visualizers are required ( this is a valid packaging scenario which was 
available in 3.3 ). The reason is that the statistical.ui plugin depends on 
log.views ( for the open with action ), while perfmon dependes on 
statistical.ui.
As a result, if we want to take the Log Viewer out of the Platform function, 
the perfmon launch configuration should go out as well since it depends on it 
indirectly through the statistical.ui plugin; this is wrong though, the perfmon 
launch capabilities should be part of the Platform project

The dependecy from perfmon to statistical.ui is due to :
- Debugger class; internal debug, can be moved to the perfmon plugin
- GData - this class is already available in the perfmon plugin
- ImageManager - since this is intended to be a base class for the statistical

    <WithOutStack>With the current plugin dependency it is impossible to separate the Log Viewer 
or statistical data viwers in a low level feature, to be available only when 
data visualizers are required ( this is a valid packaging scenario which was 
available in 3.3 ). The reason is that the statistical.ui plugin depends on 
log.views ( for the open with action ), while perfmon dependes on 
statistical.ui.
As a result, if we want to take the Log Viewer out of the Platform function, 
the perfmon launch configuration should go out as well since it depends on it 
indirectly through the statistical.ui plugin; this is wrong though, the perfmon 
launch capabilities should be part of the Platform project

The dependecy from perfmon to statistical.ui is due to :
- Debugger class; internal debug, can be moved to the perfmon plugin
- GData - this class is already available in the perfmon plugin
- ImageManager - since this is intended to be a base class for the statistical 
images, it should be defined in the perfmon plugin and shared with the 
statistical.ui or any other perfmon ui plugins
- ui widgets - they should be moved to a core component ( perfmon more likely, 
if not hyades.ui )
Updating the summary..made it less convoluted :)

    <WithStack>I have been trying to add a server and a runtime for WTP Web Services
wizard. I added a server 'MyServer'.

After doing this I did the following-
Created a new 'J2EE Web Project'. Set the default server to 'MyServer'
Created a new Web Service.
Select 'Java Bean web service'. Click Finish.

Now the runtime used is Axis while the server used is 'MyServer'. Even
though this combination of server-runtime-type is invalid still it is taken
as default. This obviously causes problems. If I go up to the 3rd page of
the wizard then an error is displayed saying that the project runtime and
selected one doesn't match and at this point the 'Next' and 'Finish' buttons
are disabled. I dont think this makes sense i.e. allowing to complete the
creation process on the first page itself while when on 3rd page its not
allowed. I logically fail to understand how a process can be completed
initially using some (wrong) default values but if I go ahead then at some
later point when the wrong combination is detected then in that case I cant
proceed.

I feel WTP should verify this server-runtime-type combination when I click
finish and display and error or disable the Finish button on the first
screen.

Looks to be like theres a bug/flaw in WTP.
This is a bug. The wizard should always choose a viable default server/RT 
configuration (when one exists) over a non-viable one. In rare cases where no 
viable server/RT exists for a given artifact type, the wizard should produce a 
clear error message when you strike Finish from page 1.
This bug now presents itself as a NullPointerException between page 2 and 3. 
The same Exception occurs on a page 1 Finish. I targeted my project to a JBoss 
server (which the Axis 1.1 Web service runtime currently does not declare 
support for in WTP) and got the following Exception in the bottom-up Web 
service scenario:

Rupam, I'm in the midst of deferring normal or lower severity out of WTP 1.0 
per [1]. This one, however, I'd rather see reverified first. With our move to 
facets this issue may no longer exist.
Created attachment 30640

patch 1 of 1
The attached patch is ready to be committed.
The problem here was that there was validation happening on page 3 of the wizard that was not being done anywhere in the commands, thus the inconsistency in behviour between clicking Finish on page 1 and clicking Next all way to page 3. The fix involves adding some validation in the ServerExtensionDefaultingCommand and ClientExtensionDefaultingCommand to ensure that the selected server, runtime, and type are compatible. 

I also changed the error message in the case of a server/runtime incompatibility so that it tells the user which Web service runtime and server are not compatible.

    <WithOutStack>I have been trying to add a server and a runtime for WTP Web Services
wizard. I added a server 'MyServer'.

After doing this I did the following-
Created a new 'J2EE Web Project'. Set the default server to 'MyServer'
Created a new Web Service.
Select 'Java Bean web service'. Click Finish.

Now the runtime used is Axis while the server used is 'MyServer'. Even
though this combination of server-runtime-type is invalid still it is taken
as default. This obviously causes problems. If I go up to the 3rd page of
the wizard then an error is displayed saying that the project runtime and
selected one doesn't match and at this point the 'Next' and 'Finish' buttons
are disabled. I dont think this makes sense i.e. allowing to complete the
creation process on the first page itself while when on 3rd page its not
allowed. I logically fail to understand how a process can be completed
initially using some (wrong) default values but if I go ahead then at some
later point when the wrong combination is detected then in that case I cant
proceed.

I feel WTP should verify this server-runtime-type combination when I click
finish and display and error or disable the Finish button on the first
screen.

Looks to be like theres a bug/flaw in WTP.
This is a bug. The wizard should always choose a viable default server/RT 
configuration (when one exists) over a non-viable one. In rare cases where no 
viable server/RT exists for a given artifact type, the wizard should produce a 
clear error message when you strike Finish from page 1.
This bug now presents itself as a NullPointerException between page 2 and 3. 
The same Exception occurs on a page 1 Finish. I targeted my project to a JBoss 
server (which the Axis 1.1 Web service runtime currently does not declare 
support for in WTP) and got the following Exception in the bottom-up Web 
service scenario:

Rupam, I'm in the midst of deferring normal or lower severity out of WTP 1.0 
per [1]. This one, however, I'd rather see reverified first. With our move to 
facets this issue may no longer exist.

    <WithStack>This is related to bug #82641.  With the new preference "Insert new line after 
annotations" set to true the behavior when adding a new Annotation is different 
based on whether the field has access modifiers.  If the field does not have 
any access modifiers then the following behavior is seen when adding an 
Annotation ast node to a field declaration

Example: 

String foo;

Add an annotation:

@MyAnnotation String foo;

Add second annotation:

@MyAnnotation
@AnotherAnnotation String foo;


If an access modifier exists then the code looks like this after the 2nd 
annotation is added.

@MyAnnotation
@AnotherAnnotation
public String foo;

Behavior should be the same whether the declaration has access modifiers or not.
The related bug is actually #82461
The code formatter is putting each annotation on its own line.
Do you use the ASTRewrite to add the new annotation? 
Yes, here is some of my code used to do this:

AST ast = astRewrite.getAST();
NormalAnnotation annotation = ast.newNormalAnnotation();
annotation.setTypeName(ast.newSimpleName("MyAnnotation"));

astRewrite.getListRewrite(bodyDeclaration,     
bodyDeclaration.getModifiersProperty()).insertAt(annotation, 0, null);

Martin,

do you have a special handling for new annotation when no modifiers are specified?
its a bug in the AST rewriter. 
Here's how to reproduce in Eclipse I20050617-0010:

import java.util.List;
class Try {
    Object m(List&lt;?&gt; arg) {
        return (List&lt;? extends String&gt;) arg; //Quick Fix 'Add @SuppressWarnings'
    }
}

=&gt; The annotation is inserted on the method declaration line. When the method
has e.g. a 'public' modifier, then it is correctly inserted on the line before.
Created attachment 38399
suggested fix
Philippe, this is one of the fixes I mentioned. Can you approve?

The fix doesn't solve all cases, but solves the simple, most common scenario when one or multople new annotations are added.
The complete fix that also does the right thing when (noremal) modifiers are removed at the same time. This is more work and I'll have a look at this in 3.3.
David - pls look at the patch
Philippe - the patch looks good for me and as said by Martin, cases don't cover by the fix are not common cases.

    <WithStack>The model vs. UI functionality should be cleaningly split so "model"
features/plugins can be correctly componentized independent from UI components. 

I've marked this as "major" since I think this is a flaw that prevents 
correct features/components from being defined. As it is now, wsdl would have 
to be included in UI featues .. which I don't think is the intent.
David, I think this can be solved by leaving the WSDL validator along with the
ant and command line UI's in the org.eclipse.wst.wsdl.validation plugin and
moving the Eclipse UI specific code to org.eclipse.wst.wsdl.ui. 

Will this work for you?
Yes, If I'm looking at it right, that would allow 
both 
 org.eclipse.ui 
 org.eclipse.wst.xml.validation
to be removed from pre-reqs. 

the org.eclipse.ui is obvious, but even 
 org.eclipse.wst.xml.validation pre-reqs org.eclipse.ui, so 
 the end-goal is to have no UI dependancies in "model" plugins. 

I've downgraded the priority to P4. As of now this will be targetted to post 0.7
as it has no affect on the end user.
Fixed and released Nov. 7. WSDL validation UI is now contained in the wsdl.ui
plug-in.

If you add a source folder inside another source folder, the outer folder's
exclusion filters are updated to avoid ambiguity.  Now, remove the inner folder
from the class path, and re-add it.  Every time this is done, the inner folder
is added to the outer folder's exclusion filter, ad infinitum.
David, how did you add the source folder.

Martin, IMO not critical. Speak up if you think different.
In the build path dialog, using the "Add Folder..." button.  I just realized
that the problem is more that the automatic exclusion is not removed when the
source folder is removed: this means that if I accidentally add "org" as a
source folder under "src", and then realize my mistake and remove "org" from the
class path, I am left with no class files, because the exclusion on org remains.
I agree that we should automatically remove the exclusions that we added.

In fact, the best thing would be if jdt.core does an automatic exclusion of
nested source folders.

!MESSAGE Resource /org.eclipse.ui.examples.job is not open.
I am not able to reproduce this. The exceptions will be properly handled so 
their is no impact on functionality (although they may require the user to 
manually reset the synchronize view). Can you give any more details of your 
setup that migh be helpful in reproducing this (or you could show it to me if 
it is reproducable for you).
I was able to get the following error. The general problem is that sync state 
accumulation does not do any locking so the state can change when information 
is being collected (not sure it that's what happened in Nick's case but it is 
here). As these cases come in, we should find the appropriate place to catch 
the exception and ignore it if it is for a closed project. We fail gracefully 
enough that we do not need to address this for 3.1.

I can reproduce it, every time I open or close that project.
I suspect the sync view needs to be open, with the closed projects being covered
by an open sync.

The stack in comment 2 looks like a different problem.
The first one involving Container.members() seems pretty clear to be caused by
the fix for bug 98740.  Apparently we should not be calling members() on closed
projects.

I agree. My point was that a pre-check would only catch some of the potential 
problems since it is also possible that the project is closed while the change 
is being processed. Also, in testing for this, I was unable to reproduce the 
failure you saw but got a slightly different one after several attempts, 
indicating to me that it is a timing issue and does notoccur all the time. As 
such, I didn't feel that a fix for 3.1 was required. If you disagree, let me 
know and we can discuss it.

!MESSAGE Resource /org.eclipse.ui.examples.job is not open.
I am not able to reproduce this. The exceptions will be properly handled so 
their is no impact on functionality (although they may require the user to 
manually reset the synchronize view). Can you give any more details of your 
setup that migh be helpful in reproducing this (or you could show it to me if 
it is reproducable for you).
I was able to get the following error. The general problem is that sync state 
accumulation does not do any locking so the state can change when information 
is being collected (not sure it that's what happened in Nick's case but it is 
here). As these cases come in, we should find the appropriate place to catch 
the exception and ignore it if it is for a closed project. We fail gracefully 
enough that we do not need to address this for 3.1.


org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSException[372]: 

I can reproduce it, every time I open or close that project.
I suspect the sync view needs to be open, with the closed projects being covered
by an open sync.

The stack in comment 2 looks like a different problem.
The first one involving Container.members() seems pretty clear to be caused by
the fix for bug 98740.  Apparently we should not be calling members() on closed
projects.

I agree. My point was that a pre-check would only catch some of the potential 
problems since it is also possible that the project is closed while the change 
is being processed. Also, in testing for this, I was unable to reproduce the 
failure you saw but got a slightly different one after several attempts, 
indicating to me that it is a timing issue and does notoccur all the time. As 
such, I didn't feel that a fix for 3.1 was required. If you disagree, let me 
know and we can discuss it.

In a new workspace, install the Geronimo 1.0 server and then create a Web 
module targeting Geronimo 1.0.  After creating a Geronimo server, I right-click 
on ther server to "Add project to server".  However, the Web module created 
does not show up on the left-hand side as available module to add.

If I then install Tomcat 5.0 and create a Tomcat 5.0 targetting module, both 
the Geronimo and Tomcat module are availabe to be added to a Tomcat 5.0 
server.  If I go back to try to add module to the Geronimo server, both the 
Geronimo and Tomcat modules are available as well.
Gorkem, 
 - this problem is caused by an NPE
  - which is caused because the GenericServerRuntime.getServerDefinitionId() is null
   - which is because GenericServerRuntime.setServerDefinitionId() is never called
    - which is because that method is (as far as I can tell) only invoked in one
place.

The id is actually set (only) in ServerTypeDefinitionRuntimeDecorator.validate().

Ignoring the question of whether a validate() method is the right place to save
data, this method is only invoked (as far as I can tell) in the
ServerTypeDefinitionDecorator.PathModifyListener.modifyText() method.

Unwinding all that, it means that if the user enters any changes in the path
field, the data is saved and all works (Kathy, you can use this as a
workaround).  However, the Geronimo adapter uses reasonable defaults for these
fields, so people do not always need to make any changes to the text.  In that
case, the modifyText method is never call, the validate is then not called, the
id is not set...  and I get an NPE later on.

I believe the best fix would be to move the following setup methods from
ServerTypeDefinitionRuntimeDecorator.validate(), and into a method that must be
called on exit of the page.  

   fRuntime.setServerDefinitionId(fRuntime.getRuntime().getRuntimeType().getId());
   fRuntime.setServerInstanceProperties(getValues());       
   fRuntime.getRuntimeWorkingCopy().setLocation(new Path(wDir));

A simpler solution may just be to force the validate method to be invoked more
robustly.

Tim you are right the name validate is confusing, I should change it to someting
more explaining validateAndSet(). But I could not reproduce this and I am not
sure this is a case of validate not being called for defaults because validate
for all decorators are called in the enter() of wizard fragments. As a result
the default values for a runtime should be set if
- there is a runtime retrieved from task model(sth like 98098)
- enter for wizard fragment is called
- the default values are validated OK
Changed Version field given new release numbering.

I could not reproduce with generic jboss server. 
I can reproduce this problem.  I'm still trying to figure out the cause, but the
behavior is that the server runtime is being partially created.  Then the
GenericServerRuntime.getServerDefinitionId() returns null, which results in the NPE.

You are correct that the validate method is being called, I have traced through
that now... but I can't figure out why the data is not correct.  To reproduce
this problem, you need to delete all the installed server runtimes (from the
preferences dialog) - for some reason (as Kathy noted), even the existance of
another runtime is enough to get the code working.   

The most detail I've observed so far is looking at the servers.xml (in the
.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core directory).  When the file is
created as the only server (ie, in the bad case), here's the file: 
  &lt;server server-type-id="org.eclipse.jst.server.geronimo.10" 
     runtime-id="Apache Geronimo v1.0" hostname="localhost" 
     name="Apache Geronimo 1.0(Generic)" id="6_15_05_4_27_PM4" 
     server-type="org.eclipse.jst.server.geronimo.10" /&gt;

When the file is created after I've created a Tomcat server (ie, delete
everything, create Tomcat, then create the new server) (this is the working
case), here's what I see: 

  &lt;server server-type-id="org.eclipse.jst.server.geronimo.10" 
     runtime-id="Apache Geronimo v1.0(Generic)" hostname="localhost" 
     name="Apache Geronimo 1.0(Generic)" id="6_15_05_4_27_PM4" 
     server-type="org.eclipse.jst.server.geronimo.10" /&gt;

Notice the runtime-id - in the second scenario, it includes (Generic), but in
the first case, it does not.

This is only a half-done investigation, and therefore a half-baked theory - but
what I'm exploring is whether some piece of code (mine or yours) is (or should
be) appending this string to the id.  Subsequent usages of the data therefore
fail because it's missing the (Generic) tag - and that results in the null ID
and subsequent NPE.

Either way, this is a valid defect, so please reactivate it - pass the ownership
over to me if you wish, as I'm quite willing to believe (now) that the problem
is in my code somewhere....

Tim, I could not reproduce this one using I0623 but I was not able to reproduce
before that either. I am transfering it to you since I can not progress.
I can no longer reproduce this, using eclipse 3.1 &amp; the WTP 6/30 build.  If you
still see the problem, please reopen the bug.
Using Eclipse 3.1 with WTP0.7RC1, I am able to see the geronimo-targetted 
projects and add them to Geronimo server.  However, if I right-click on a 
Geronimo or Tomcat server and select "Add or remove project", I can add 
projects regardless of whether them are targetted to Tomcat and Geronimo.  Is 
this supposed to be the case or should only the project targetted to a specific 
server be visible?
Hi Kathy,

That is the correct behaviour - we never use a runtime target to filter or
restrict where the user can deploy an application. It is equivalent to the JDT,
where you can compile against one JRE and run on a different one, or even
multiple different ones.

Although targetting a project to a specific runtime may allow the user to use
some runtime-specific features, we have no way of knowing that this is the case.
They may also have targetted to a generic J2EE library or a previous version of
a runtime, which would allow the app to run fine. In the end, it is the user's
decision (and choice of risk) if they want to compile and run against different
runtimes.
Problem fixed in WTP0.7RC1.  Closing.</WithStack>

This happens with or without the fix for bug 52921. Examples see there.
This seems to fail for the same kind of reason as bug 52921.
If the code contains a space after the '*', a new space gets added.
It not only shifts everything one space to the right, it also adds an empty line
before and after the text which is even more anoying.

It seems that

 &lt;pre&gt;
 whatever
 &lt;/pre&gt;

stays okay while

The spacing problem remaining as of comment 4 still happens with:

Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050627-1435

triggers the problem:

Formatting this snippet repeatedly adds a space in front of &amp;lt; with each

&lt;pre&gt; elements with only one line of content do not trigger the bug but as the

Well, so what happens with this bug? It has been detected in 3.1 and still can be found in 3.2. Is there any plan to fix it in 3.3?

Please keep in mind, that documentation is very important and shall not be inhibited by tedious bugs like this.
Yes, this is intended to be fixed for 3.3. Right now I have to focus on other things. But if you want to provide a patch, I'll review it.

Olivier, is there any chance we can fix this for 3.2.2? From the number of dups, it seems like it's really causing grief for people.
I can investigate a fix. A solution for 3.2.2 will depend on the risk involved with the fix. I cannot make any promise for 3.2.2 for now.
Risk? This bug means that no one can put code examples in their JavaDoc! Certainly in our project we're endeavouring to do that as we have many users who are new to the GUI toolkit we present and so need to embed all kinds of code snippets. At the moment, every time you hit code format, everything precesses to the right one character, and your version control tool thinks you've got a change on those lines. Endlessly removing single space characters manually is getting really really old. Is there any shred of hope you can offer us?

The behavior of build M20070112-1200 on the test case of comment #6 is not perfect, but it is different from the one which triggered this bug. I opened the fup bug 170580 to track that separate issue.
The original defect is fixed.

This happens with or without the fix for bug 52921. Examples see there.
This seems to fail for the same kind of reason as bug 52921.
If the code contains a space after the '*', a new space gets added.
It not only shifts everything one space to the right, it also adds an empty line
before and after the text which is even more anoying.

It seems that

 &lt;pre&gt;
 whatever
 &lt;/pre&gt;

stays okay while

 &lt;pre&gt;
 whatever
 whatever
 &lt;/pre&gt;

starts moving...
Please read comment 0 and bug 52921 mentioned there.

The Project Explorer fails to show me the file I'm editing when I first bring up
the workbench.

From the J2EE perspective, open a file from a non-flexible non-Web non-Java
project and be sure the Project Explorer has "Link Editor" enabled.  Restarting
the workbench reopens the right editor but doesn't expand the Project Explorer
to show me the location of my file, despite "Link Editor" still being enabled. 
Toggling "Link Editor" has no effect.  Only opening the Other Projects node
seems to make it start working.

Part of a mass update. Based on 9/22/2005 development review meeting, it's 
determined this was an open bug/enhancement with tartget mistakenly set to M8. 
Since this will not be in M8, I am changing to "unspecified". 

If this is an error, please correct (for example the bug really has been fixed
in M8, change back to M8, and "fixed".)

This is still one of the most annoying bugs of the Project Explorer.

on a machine supporting the Windows Terminal Server.
- Log in from a remote terminal
- Start Workbench from the remote terminal (Note 1)
- Start Profiling an application on the same machine.
Note 1: on a machine configured for quick user switching, workbench may also be 
started from any other named terminal session.

You get the error message:
"“IWAT0004W Problems occurred while launching the Java Process.  Reason:  
Profiler unable to establish connection with RAC.  Possible fix: Add more 
memory or reduce dataChannelSize in serviceconfig.xml."

The problem turns out to be a mismatch in the namespace for named objects. The 
RAC, started as described above, causes all of its named objects to be created 
in the global namespace. The shared memory between the RAC and piAgent is one 
such named object.

The Workbench (and the SUT) when started by a user logged in from a remote 
terminal or on a machine configured for quick user switching, from a 
differently named terminal session, creates all named objects prefixed with the 
session name.

The end result of this mismatch in the namespaces for the RAC and the SUT is 
that the SUT cannot locate the shared memory object created by the RAC.

The object names for the shared memory as reported by procExp are:
RAService.exe 	\BaseNamedObjects\OSSMEMrabuffer0
java.exe	\Sessions\12\BaseNamedObjects\OSSMEMrabuffer0
(In ProcExp, select the process and do a Find -&gt; Find Handle...)

How to fix:
	All named objects, both in the RAC and in the Workbench should be 
created in the Global namespace. This may be achieved by adding the "Global\" 
prefix to all named object at creation time. For example,

CreateFileMapping(….,”Global\MySharedMemory”);

The default is local or session namespace.
Note that this change should be implemented for all shared named objects on 
both RAC and Workbench sides.
I am assigning this to Samson for RAC.

---------
From EAR Wizard, choose new modules button to create a number of J2EE modules.
Modules were created successfully.
Select the new modules
Then clicked on the Finish button of the EAR wizard to create the EAR with its 
modules. 
The EAR was created but its modules are missing. Basically the modules were not 
added to the EAR.


Defect#2:
---------
Trying to save the EAR (Ctl-S) and the following dialog is displayed:
"Could not edit binary projects. All changes will be lost when you click OK. 
Are you sure you want to continue?"

How could I create an EAR where I could save the changes?
Changed Version field given new release numbering.

Not sure what build you are using however in current drivers this working just
fine.  There was a fix put in last week to fix Defect #1....its in last weeks
I-build.  In terms of defect #2 I created an ear then edited the application.xml
manually and hit ctrl-s and things saved just fine.  If you did something else
let me know.

    <WithStack>You aren't required to specify implicit dependencies in plugin.xml (or
manifest.mf). PDE figures them out and sets the expanded dependencies in your
Build Path. But when you do a Build/Build All in the update .site editor for a
site that specifies a plug-in project that builds fine in Eclipse, the same
project has build errors, apparently due to the implied dependencies.

From his comment in the newsgroup, apparently Pascal thinks that the dependency
expansion done automatically or by Compute Classpath is not a feature and that
you have to explicitly specify all dependencies. a) This isn't the way it works
and b) if it were, it would be horrible; it would be impossible to specify the
dependencies in a platform-independent way.

Another user commented: This is bug, probably.There are more example
emf,gef,ve,webtools - all build in workspace, but export for deployment
doesn't work
Could you give steps on how to reproduce?
Apparently, you can just install GEF as a source project and try it.

But, for example, I have a project with an explicit dependency on
org.eclipse.jface.text but no explicit dependency on org.eclipse.jface. The
Build Path computed by PDE includes org.eclipse.jface.

If I try to do, e.g., an update build from this project, any references to
org.eclipse.jface packages are compile errors.
The Build Path also contains a dependency on org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86
when there is only an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.swt. I didn't start
with this example because it may be special-cased, but it is a fairly key feature.

PS I'm still trying to figure out how to do n platform-dependent builds from one
"manifest".
Example of such an error in a project that compiles without error in Eclipse
using a PDE-generated build path:

I'm rather surprised that _any_ project builds.
Do you have projects loaded as linked folder in your workspace?
No, all projects are physically in the workspace folder.
I got GEF from HEAD of the repository and exported it and everything worked fine.
Please build me a reproduceable test case from a fresh workspace.
Can I shine your shoes while I'm up? ;-}

You could try to make your own example, you know. I described what to do pretty
clearly. The GEF thing was some other user's experience, not mine.
Today I spent my day building various projects and RCP app without problems.
If I'm asking it is because I can't reproduce...


Fair enough.

Looking back, I may have answered one of your questions incorrectly. I said no
to linked project folders because I'm not conscious of them as linked folders.
Apparently linked project folders don't show the decoration that user-defined
linked folders in projects do. But yes I have every SDK plugin in my workspace
as a linked folder. And you're right, it's hard to reproduce this problem unless
you do.

    <WithStack>Remove all references to CPL and make sure all copyright holders resubmit under
the new licensing.
Must be done for 3.0.
Someone at QNX has written some Python scripts to do source license updates - 
maybe we could reuse this to remove the CPL references. If there's interest, I 
will provide more info. 
The eclispe releng plugin already handles this, for the IBM contribution its
simple, just run the action to fix copyrights, for anyone else you just need to
change the code slightly so that is detect your copyright (replace "IBM Corp" in
a few places with "your company") I have already tried this for QNX copyright
files and if works fine. 
Looks like everyone else is done. I'll do IBM's and the sweep to make sure we've
got everything.
Doug, I have both QNX and IBM copyright changes ready to checkin, now that M7 is
out I can check these in if you'd like, or I can just do QNX.... Let me know.
Thanks, Dave. Please do the QNX ones. In theory, the copyright holders are the
only ones that can change the licensing so I'll take care of the IBM ones.
I have updated the feature goodies and all of the about.html's that weren't
already updated.

Dave, most of the C source files for the libraries do not have copyrights in
them. Do you plan on updating them as well since they should by copyright QNX?

Once the QNX and IBM copyrights are updated, I'll do a sweep (i.e. read 'grep')

(In reply to comment #7)
&gt; I have updated the feature goodies and all of the about.html's that weren't
&gt; already updated.
&gt; 
&gt; Dave, most of the C source files for the libraries do not have copyrights in
&gt; them. Do you plan on updating them as well since they should by copyright QNX?
&gt; 
&gt; Once the QNX and IBM copyrights are updated, I'll do a sweep (i.e. read 'grep')
&gt; to make sure we've got everything.
&gt; 
Ok, I'm done &gt; 2600 files updated (including he C source) with &gt; 700 still
containing "legal/cpl", which at a glance looks like Rational copyrights a some
non-standard IBM copyrights.  Do you want to take a stab at whats left?

opps, I missed you comment about you changing the IBM copyrights.... I hope that
doesn't mess things up for you
Shouldn't really matter.

I think I'll have to change the Rational copyrights to IBM copyrights as I
update the licensing. It looks like the script will be able to handle that.
I can't find anymore occurances of cpl- that aren't on purpose. I think we're done.
While the CPL to EPL transition appears to be done, I've come across numerous files that either don't 
have any license text at all, or they have a simple copyright statement.  These should all be updated to 
use the EPL template as well.

I ran this shell command (from the workspace dir) to generate a list of files that need to be updated:

  for x in {java,properties}; do for f in `find . -name *.$x`; do grep -L "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/
epl-v10.html" $f; done; done

I get 303 files listed.

Reopening this bug until all files can be accounted for.

Thanks chris, this seem to be very old stuff when Hoda, myself and other
folks were working on the CDT,  at that time the copyright was simply:

/*
 * (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 2000, 2001.
 * All Rights Reserved.
 */

For Hoda

and something similar for me but with "QNX software system".

I'll review this.  Doug, I'll grab this one for now.

Thanks.

My !! I should apologize to Hoda must of the stuff that had
the IBM copyright ... was written by me !!!
sigh, fixing this in the head.  I beleive in those old days
I had some code Template when creating the file..
reassigning to you doug.

3 plugins left.

- org.eclipse.debug.win32.core
- org.eclipse.debug.win32.ui
- org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests

you are the most like Copyright holder of this

There is one more file in the refactoring code own by windRiver system
I fixed up the last remaining files I could find.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Remove all references to CPL and make sure all copyright holders resubmit under
the new licensing.
Must be done for 3.0.
Someone at QNX has written some Python scripts to do source license updates - 
maybe we could reuse this to remove the CPL references. If there's interest, I 
will provide more info. 
The eclispe releng plugin already handles this, for the IBM contribution its
simple, just run the action to fix copyrights, for anyone else you just need to
change the code slightly so that is detect your copyright (replace "IBM Corp" in
a few places with "your company") I have already tried this for QNX copyright
files and if works fine. 
Looks like everyone else is done. I'll do IBM's and the sweep to make sure we've
got everything.
Doug, I have both QNX and IBM copyright changes ready to checkin, now that M7 is
out I can check these in if you'd like, or I can just do QNX.... Let me know.
Thanks, Dave. Please do the QNX ones. In theory, the copyright holders are the
only ones that can change the licensing so I'll take care of the IBM ones.
I have updated the feature goodies and all of the about.html's that weren't
already updated.

My test workspace has 30 projects in it, some quite large.  When I initially
expand the Other Projects node in the Project Explorer, the Progress view fills
up with a large number of "Extract the Content Descriptor of children" Jobs. 
Too many, possibly, since everything becomes unresponsive for a while.
Part of a mass update. Based on 9/22/2005 development review meeting, it's 
determined this was an open bug/enhancement with tartget mistakenly set to M8. 
Since this will not be in M8, I am changing to "unspecified". 

If this is an error, please correct (for example the bug really has been fixed
in M8, change back to M8, and "fixed".)

Can this still be reproduced?
Jobs are no longer used to preload extensions. Closing as Invalid. 
Closing bug, although I would have rather seen the resolution as "Fixed".</WithStack>

In bug 69000 comment 43, Pat asks about some issues with the configured features
section in the config details (geenrated by ConfigLogUpdateSection

Why is the order somewhat random (not sorted by id for instance)?
Why is the version id null?  A version id kind of required don't you think?

My test case on 0608:
 Configured features:
  ID: org.eclipse.platform, Version: null
  ID: com.ibm.jdg2e.extensionpoint, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.rcp, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.platform.source, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.jdt, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.jdt.source, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.pde, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.sdk, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.pde.source, Version: null
  ID: org.eclipse.rcp.source, Version: null
  ID: com.ibm.jdg2e.extensionpoint.rootfeature, Version: null
  ID: com.ibm.jdg2e.extensionpoint.test, Version: null


The null version looks like a bug that should be fixed for 3.1.
It would be nice to have them appear in sorted order as well, for ease of
reading when diagnosing any problems.
It may also be worth showing the features' paths, as is done for the plug-ins.

This is a mass update of Platform Update bugs that have had no activity in three years. Platform Update was replaced in Eclipse 3.4 (2008) by a new provisioning system called Equinox p2. If this bug or enhancement is not already addressed in p2 please enter a new bug report against p2 (RT &gt; Equinox &gt; p2). If you still want to see this bug addressed in the deprecated Platform Update component, please reopen this bug. Patches welcome.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>TableTree was deprecated during one of the 3.1Milestone levels.  When that
happened, the border-painting code in FormToolkit was changed.  It used to say
in one part:
   else if (inactiveBorder || c instanceof Table
	|| c instanceof Tree || c instanceof TableTree) {
     ... code to paint the border

After TableTree was deprecated, the "c instanceof TableTree" was removed in the
above clause.  The result is that TableTrees no longer have their border
painted.  This is a problem.  We can't switch to the replacement for TableTrees
without pre-reqing level 3.1 of Eclipse.  But our code needs to run on 3.0
levels as well.

Please restore the painting of borders for TableTrees, even though it is
deprecated.
RC3 candidate.

We will restore the support by adding TableTree back in the 'or' clause.
Risk: slim to none. We had that code before.
Mazen, can you serve as approver for this bug?
sounds like a safe fix. reverting to tested code. you have my blessings! :)

"??? QUESTION???"
***********************
When I look at the Help preference page I still see the items in the doc 
screenshot that you are saying no longer exist...I 

don't know where to go from here...I'll wait to update the table once I can 
view the final version of the preference page.


#25 - Text and image updated.

#26 - Text and image updated.

#27 - Text, links and image updated.

#28 - Will contact CVS team.

#29 - Text and image updated.

#30 - Text and image updated.
#6 - ignore I'm not sure what I was getting at here
#7 - talk to Daniel Megert
#9 - please use "Use this option to specify the line delimiter to use for new
text files.  NOTE this will generally not effect the file line delimiter for
existing files."
#24 - the mismatch is in what you find in the table of options vs what is in the
image.  The second item in the table is "Current web browser adapter" for
example, but this is not on the page.
Hi Daniel,

Could you provide me with some information that I can  add to the Accesibility 
Preferences page doc?  

Basically, I need a short description for the following items:
-Use custom caret
-Enable thick caret
-Use characters to show changes on line number bar

Please let me know if there's any other information that I should add.

Thanks,

AC
Hi Andrea.

&gt;-Use custom caret
Replaces the caret that is provided by the Platform widget with the one that we
provide and shows a different caret for Overwrite and Insert mode.

&gt;-Enable thick caret
The caret is a bit thicker so that it is more visible.

&gt;-Use characters to show changes on line number bar
Quick Diff shows the changes in a vertical ruler using colors. Color blind
persons can enable to show the differences with different characters in the line
number ruler.
OK, I have made the updates based on the answers provided to my questions. 
Thanks!

The only remaining items are CVS/Team related. (See: comment#13 number 28 &amp; 
comment#4 number 7 Team team items)

I have noticed that some of these docs have been updated by others in the past 
few days. 

Team people - Are you updating these pages?

Thanks,

AC
Yes, I have updated the content of the Team pages for 3.1. I didn't realize I 
had the option not to;-) There are a few things I haven't done:

1) I haven't added any images. If it is felt that these add to the doc, then 
they can be added.

2) I haven't divided the general page into it's tab sections but it probably 
should be.

3) All the CVS preference pages are covered on the same page. There could be 
split out into separate pages.

Andrea, will you take care of these or should I? I do have spare cycles if you 
are short of time.

On a side note, why isn't the preferences index hierarchical? This would makes 
sense to me since that is how the preference pages themselves are organized.


Hi Michael (Valenta),

I would love it if you could take care of those pages, I am quite busy at the 
moment and that would be greatly appreciated.  

As far as your side note, good point, Michael (Van Meekeren) just suggested 
ordering them alphabetically and I have since reordered the pages.  While I 
think from a logical point of view your suggestion makes sense, I think it may 
be easier to maintain alphabetically.  I can see it getting missed in the doc 
when the hierarchical order changes in the product. I'm not against it either, 
I just think it could become a problem.

Thanks,
AC
OK, I'll take care of it. As for the indexing, I'm fine with alphabetical but 
I'll need to update some of the titles of the doc pages. MVM missed some of 
the preference pages because the title was the name of the preference page 
(e.g. Ignore Resources) instead of the path (e.g. Team Ignored Resources). 
I'll make the appropriate changes.
The Team and CVS preference page doc has been updated.
Marking as fixed.

- Files and Folders Tab not mentioned
- Connection tab not mentioned

I give up, the Team team needs to re-visit all this, the sub pages under CVS are
only partially covered in the doc and also whole pages are missing, e.g.
"sychronize/compare"

#29) Ignored Resources
- no image of the page exists
- there is no "Add" button as mentioned it is "Add Pattern..."

#30) File Content
- no image of the page exists
- there is no "Add" button as mentioned it is "Add Extension..."



Although I have tried to address all of the issues in this bug, I do require 
clarification on a few of them, as indicated by 

the 
***********************

"??? QUESTION???"
***********************
When I look at the Help preference page I still see the items in the doc 
screenshot that you are saying no longer exist...I 

don't know where to go from here...I'll wait to update the table once I can 
view the final version of the preference page.


#25 - Text and image updated.

#26 - Text and image updated.

#27 - Text, links and image updated.

#28 - Will contact CVS team.

#29 - Text and image updated.

#30 - Text and image updated.
#6 - ignore I'm not sure what I was getting at here
#7 - talk to Daniel Megert
#9 - please use "Use this option to specify the line delimiter to use for new
text files.  NOTE this will generally not effect the file line delimiter for
existing files."
#24 - the mismatch is in what you find in the table of options vs what is in the
image.  The second item in the table is "Current web browser adapter" for
example, but this is not on the page.
Hi Daniel,

Could you provide me with some information that I can  add to the Accesibility 
Preferences page doc?  

Basically, I need a short description for the following items:
-Use custom caret
-Enable thick caret
-Use characters to show changes on line number bar

Please let me know if there's any other information that I should add.

Thanks,

AC
Hi Andrea.

&gt;-Use custom caret
Replaces the caret that is provided by the Platform widget with the one that we
provide and shows a different caret for Overwrite and Insert mode.

&gt;-Enable thick caret
The caret is a bit thicker so that it is more visible.

&gt;-Use characters to show changes on line number bar
Quick Diff shows the changes in a vertical ruler using colors. Color blind
persons can enable to show the differences with different characters in the line
number ruler.
OK, I have made the updates based on the answers provided to my questions. 
Thanks!

The only remaining items are CVS/Team related. (See: comment#13 number 28 &amp; 
comment#4 number 7 Team team items)

I have noticed that some of these docs have been updated by others in the past 
few days. 

Team people - Are you updating these pages?

Thanks,

AC
Yes, I have updated the content of the Team pages for 3.1. I didn't realize I 
had the option not to;-) There are a few things I haven't done:

1) I haven't added any images. If it is felt that these add to the doc, then 
they can be added.

2) I haven't divided the general page into it's tab sections but it probably 
should be.

3) All the CVS preference pages are covered on the same page. There could be 
split out into separate pages.

Andrea, will you take care of these or should I? I do have spare cycles if you 
are short of time.

On a side note, why isn't the preferences index hierarchical? This would makes 
sense to me since that is how the preference pages themselves are organized.


Hi Michael (Valenta),

I would love it if you could take care of those pages, I am quite busy at the 
moment and that would be greatly appreciated.  

As far as your side note, good point, Michael (Van Meekeren) just suggested 
ordering them alphabetically and I have since reordered the pages.  While I 
think from a logical point of view your suggestion makes sense, I think it may 
be easier to maintain alphabetically.  I can see it getting missed in the doc 
when the hierarchical order changes in the product. I'm not against it either, 
I just think it could become a problem.

Thanks,
AC
OK, I'll take care of it. As for the indexing, I'm fine with alphabetical but 
I'll need to update some of the titles of the doc pages. MVM missed some of 
the preference pages because the title was the name of the preference page 
(e.g. Ignore Resources) instead of the path (e.g. Team Ignored Resources). 
I'll make the appropriate changes.
The Team and CVS preference page doc has been updated.
Marking as fixed.

    <WithStack>Chuck has OK'd adding commonu.uriresolver as a dependency for common.modulecore
so the extension can be supplied by that plugin.
Created org.eclipse.wst.common.componentcore.internal.util.ComponentResolver and
committed to HEAD.  It is associated with projects having the
org.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNature nature only.
There's a flaw in resolving references not beginning with "/" when the reference
itself is absolute.
Should check if the given system reference is a file on the filesystem and
return null if so.

    <WithStack>I've looked at the JEM dependancies common frameworks has on JEM, and they 
are all extremely minor. 

Appears could be cleaned up by 15 minutes of copying utility classes and 
"organize imports". 

I've marked as 'major' since this prevents proper dependancy trees, and 
scares people away from using org.eclipse.wst.common.frameworks.

    <WithStack>This is an unneccesary dependancy that complicates the life of all that 
want to extend/implement validation. Seems only reason its done this way 
is for some common "utility" functions like logging, which should be 
re-implemented in validation code itself. 

wst.validation framework needs to be very light weight. 

I marked as major since this complicates whole dependancy tree, and 
is preventing other plugin consolidataion.
It is the same issue as 99797: org.eclipse.wst.validation should not depend on

I'll be more than happy to provide additional information or testing - just 
feel free to ask!

Thanks!
Doesn't happen on XP.  Veronika to try 2000.
Just F.Y.I., I created a simple SWT application, using Eclipse's same SWT 
libraries.  Starting with FileDialog.open(), I was able to retrieve the file 
name, without causing the 100% processor usage, which would lead me to believe 
it's _not_ a problem with anything there or higher up the stack trace, 
including org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.  (Unless there were other options 
or settings in effect that I didn't duplicate...)

I tried to do the same starting at FilePrompt(), but things became a bit too 
integrated within Eclipse for me to easily extract out at that point.

I've also since upgraded to 3.1 RC2, with no changes.

Also note, the 100% processor usage only happens while the window is in focus.  
Moving focus to another window drops the CPU to 0%.  Moving focus back to the 
FileDialog raises javaw's CPU usage back to 100%.
Doesn't happen with SWT.  What is the fully quailified name for FilePrompt?
I'm not sure what the FQN is for FilePrompt; for some reason the debugger can't 
find the source for either PromptingResolver or FilePrompt, or show the FQN's.  
A Google search finds Eclipse bug 65051, which suggests 
org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.stringsubstitution.FilePrompt.
Nick, do you have any idea who owns the FQN FilePrompt?
From Eclipse, choose File -&gt; Open File ...

On Windows 2000, this consistently makes the CPU go to 100%.  On Windows XP it 
does not.

If I just run the ControlExample, the FileDialog does not peg the CPU. 
I do not see 100% CPU usage on my laptop running Win2K SP4.

The code for File &gt; Open File... is in OpenExternalFileAction in the
org.eclipse.ui.editors plug-in.

It's created with the following style bits and other configuration:

FileDialog dialog= new FileDialog(fWindow.getShell(), SWT.OPEN | SWT.MULTI);
dialog.setText(TextEditorMessages.OpenExternalFileAction_title);
dialog.setFilterPath(fFilterPath);

where fFilterPath is initialized using:
fFilterPath= System.getProperty("user.home"); //$NON-NLS-1$

In the standalone example, does SWT.MULTI or setting the filter path change things?

See also 88958.
... bug 88958.
Probably a dup of bug 88958, but I won't mark it that until I know what the 
problem is.

I can replicate this on XP using the steps in either comment 0 or comment 6, 
particularly if I click on "My Computer" in the dialog (get the "searching 
flashlight" in the dialog, and CPU is 100% until I click on some other app).

I can't as yet replicate with a simple SWT snippet, and no, | SWT.MULTI and 
setFilterPath don't make any difference, but thanks for suggesting.

I suspect strongly that it is something in the area of UISynchronizer, and I 
will look first in that direction.
Thanks for looking at this.  I'd just like to note I also have the same 
symptoms described in bug #88958 comment #6 with the directory dialog.  (I'm 
curious to see where Eclipse Bugs links the #6.  :-)


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 88958 ***
i don't think this bug should be a duplicate of that one for windows xp!
on windows xp there is a workaround using the manifest file, windows 2000 has 
no such workaround.
in my opinion the problem should have higher priority for windows 2000!</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>To reproduce:

- Choose Run, "Run...".

either "file_prompt" or "folder_prompt" to prompt the user for a variable(s) to 
pass to main(...).

Running Eclipse I20050513-1415 (3.1M7).
I'll be more than happy to provide additional information or testing - just 
feel free to ask!

Thanks!
Doesn't happen on XP.  Veronika to try 2000.
Just F.Y.I., I created a simple SWT application, using Eclipse's same SWT 
libraries.  Starting with FileDialog.open(), I was able to retrieve the file 
name, without causing the 100% processor usage, which would lead me to believe 
it's _not_ a problem with anything there or higher up the stack trace, 
including org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.  (Unless there were other options 
or settings in effect that I didn't duplicate...)

I tried to do the same starting at FilePrompt(), but things became a bit too 
integrated within Eclipse for me to easily extract out at that point.

I've also since upgraded to 3.1 RC2, with no changes.

Also note, the 100% processor usage only happens while the window is in focus.  
Moving focus to another window drops the CPU to 0%.  Moving focus back to the 
FileDialog raises javaw's CPU usage back to 100%.
Doesn't happen with SWT.  What is the fully quailified name for FilePrompt?
I'm not sure what the FQN is for FilePrompt; for some reason the debugger can't 
find the source for either PromptingResolver or FilePrompt, or show the FQN's.  
A Google search finds Eclipse bug 65051, which suggests 
org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.stringsubstitution.FilePrompt.
Nick, do you have any idea who owns the FQN FilePrompt?
From Eclipse, choose File -&gt; Open File ...

On Windows 2000, this consistently makes the CPU go to 100%.  On Windows XP it 
does not.

If I just run the ControlExample, the FileDialog does not peg the CPU. 
I do not see 100% CPU usage on my laptop running Win2K SP4.

The code for File &gt; Open File... is in OpenExternalFileAction in the
org.eclipse.ui.editors plug-in.

It's created with the following style bits and other configuration:

FileDialog dialog= new FileDialog(fWindow.getShell(), SWT.OPEN | SWT.MULTI);
dialog.setText(TextEditorMessages.OpenExternalFileAction_title);
dialog.setFilterPath(fFilterPath);

where fFilterPath is initialized using:
fFilterPath= System.getProperty("user.home"); //$NON-NLS-1$

In the standalone example, does SWT.MULTI or setting the filter path change things?

See also 88958.
... bug 88958.
Probably a dup of bug 88958, but I won't mark it that until I know what the 
problem is.

I can replicate this on XP using the steps in either comment 0 or comment 6, 
particularly if I click on "My Computer" in the dialog (get the "searching 
flashlight" in the dialog, and CPU is 100% until I click on some other app).

I can't as yet replicate with a simple SWT snippet, and no, | SWT.MULTI and 
setFilterPath don't make any difference, but thanks for suggesting.

I suspect strongly that it is something in the area of UISynchronizer, and I 
will look first in that direction.
Thanks for looking at this.  I'd just like to note I also have the same 
symptoms described in bug #88958 comment #6 with the directory dialog.  (I'm 
curious to see where Eclipse Bugs links the #6.  :-)


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 88958 ***
i don't think this bug should be a duplicate of that one for windows xp!
on windows xp there is a workaround using the manifest file, windows 2000 has 
no such workaround.
in my opinion the problem should have higher priority for windows 2000!</WithOutStack>

Doesn't the org.eclispe runtime interfaces suffice for

The problem with using IRunnableWithProgress is that that interface is in the org.eclipse.jface plugin, which pulls in UI plugins.  IHeadlessRunnableWithProgress is identical, but does not cause us to prereq UI plugins in our non-UI plugins... hence the naming convention with "Headless".

I am going to close this as WONTFIX, but if you so desire, we could reopen this and ask that IRunnableWithProgress be moved down to a non-UI plugin in base Eclipse.</WithStack>

The standalone SWT download has an about_files directory containing the LGPL and
MPL licenses.  This shows up as a java package in the JDT package explorer view.
 I think it would be cleaner to just remove the subdirectory and put these files
in the root.
You can not remove the subdirectory because the about.html license file makes 
reference to it.
Why not fix it to not reference the directory?
This is how Adrian wanted it set up.  You would have to get his approval.  

From my own point of view, we don't want a different about.html for the 
standalone versus eclipse.  Having the folder simplifies our build scripts and 
Sonia's build scripts.  I really don't see the issue here.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>As far as I can tell, this is a minor dependancy on Logger, and 
should be easy to cleanup with a little copy and organize imports. 

I marked as 'major' since this prevents other plugin owners from 
cleaning up their dependancies trees.
David, We already tried copying the Logger class from jem.util to validation 
plugin and it resulted in copying more than one class i,e classes Logger 
depends on like
1. ILogRenderer
2. ILogRenderer2
3. JDKConsoleRenderer
4. LogEntry
5. DefaultPluginTraceRenderer
6. AbstractWorkBenchRenderer
...
There were around 10 classes and an extension point too that had to be copied 
and we stepped back on it. This also included the cleanup of subclassing from 
the WTPPlugin.

The fix for this problem is all the jem utilities that we depend in
org.eclipse.jem.util plugin  moving down to emf utilities that is going to
happen in M8 for 1.0
I disagree that you should depend on utilities in EMF for "logging". 
At least ... I don't see the need or purpose for that? 
Can you explain why Eclipe's loging framework is not sufficient?

Even if you needed something "special", it would be far better to 
use copies of some small "logging" classes than to introduce a dependancy 
for just logging. 
Hi - no one is disputing that these dependencies can be broken,  but this needs
to wait until M8.   By pushing the EMF ext classes to EMF, and pulling up the
Logging/Resistry classes into our plugins, this can be done, but it will be
destabilizing at this point.
Thanks all. Please let me know if/how I can help. 
(e.g. if you have some special logging requirements that are not being 
met, I'd like to understand ... really! :)

    <WithStack>On the 20050608 build I ran into a problem where the Project Explorer in the 
J2EE perspective created an empty webservices.xml file.  Automatic validation 
of this new file started and generated an error.  Here is what the details of 
the validation error message said:

The errors below were detected when validating the 
file "j2ee_web_services_1_1.xsd" via the file "webservices.xml".  In most cases 
these errors can be detected by validating "j2ee_web_services_1_1.xsd" 
directly.  However it is possible that errors will only occur when 
j2ee_web_services_1_1.xsd is validated in the context of webservices.xml.

White spaces are required between publicId and systemId.

To reproduce this problem perform the following:
1) Create a Flexible project with one module in a blank workspace.
2) Open the J2EE perspective.
3) In the Project Explorer view expand the Web Services entry in the tree.
4) Then expand the Services folder and the Client folder.  At this point the 
empty webservices.xml file is generated and the validation is kicked off.

It seems a bit odd that a deployment descriptor would be generated just by 
viewing the Project Explorer.  However, I could live with this as long as there 
was no validation error generated.
This is fixed for the 0627 WTP I build.
Verified that this is fixed in the I20050628 driver.
Fixed.</WithStack>

The idea here is that not all rcp templates should be that rich.  We provide a

McQ is seeing crashes ...
I saw a total of three yesterday. Each time it was when doing "close all", but I did many "close all" 
operations that did not fail. I did not notice any obvious pattern for the failing cases.
Happened again today. Here's another crash log:

McQ, you still seeing random crashes?
I am doing more html editing right now, but haven't tried "Close All" recently ('cause it scares me &lt;g&gt;). I'll do a bit of testing and comment further.

Closing report, platform is discontinued.</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>I had several embedded browsers open on .html files, then hit Command-Shift-W to close them all, and 
immediately clicked on another .html file and got the crash shown below. I have single click activation 
enabled.

I saw a total of three yesterday. Each time it was when doing "close all", but I did many "close all" 
operations that did not fail. I did not notice any obvious pattern for the failing cases.
Happened again today. Here's another crash log:

McQ, you still seeing random crashes?
I am doing more html editing right now, but haven't tried "Close All" recently ('cause it scares me &lt;g&gt;). I'll do a bit of testing and comment further.

The recursive part creation warning could be omitted with no ill-effects. This
enhancement suggests only logging the exception when in debug mode. 

I'm filing this bug for discussion because some clients find the warning
annoying. However, I'm not sure this is a good idea. Most clients are unaware
that creating cyclic dependancies between views is a bug, and they find the
warning annoying because they believe the bug is in the workbench - not their
own code. The likely result of omitting the warning is that the bugs will remain
 undetected and unfixed. Suggest closing this as WONTFIX.
There are currently no plans to work on this feature.

On creation of a new rcp app, none of the example contains a product file. I'm
not sure why it is the case, but one sure thing is that it makes very little
sense for a user which for the first time of its life wants to try the coolness
of RCP.

I'm marking as major not only to get Wassim's attention, but because I think it
is unfortunate that such a tremendous effort has been spent on making RCP easy
to use, but we are missing this little thing that would complete the story.
This is a good idea for an ENHANCEMENT.

It is actually not that easy to implement.
Generating a pre-canned product file with the template is actually a lot of work and complex and not portable.

However, with the recent addition of the option to add branding to all the rcp templates and the context-sensitivity of the Product configuration wizard, 
dreating a product configuration after-the-fact becomes trivial.</WithStack>

- Create a new RCP app using the Hello template. 
- Create a new product definition (notice that first a random product is being
defined, I think this is kind of bogus as users tend to just go with the default
settings), and pick the last option.
- Once on the product editor open, create a product and save. You will notice
that immediatly the plugin.xml is marked of a red X, indicating that the name
has not been specified.
- Go back to the product editor, type a product name and save again. The red X
does not go away. 

I think that when the product name is being entered a synchronization with the
plugin.xml should be done so users can have an opportunity to fix the errors
they see.

Marking as major since most products don't ship with a product and people will
be exposed to this puzzling pb.

    <WithStack>When no prenormalization extensions are defined for the ExtensibleURIResolver,

Patch to ExtensibleURIResolver.java to respect "/"

Treats URIs beginning with "/" differently when an in-workspace file has been

Created attachment 22972
updated patch

Attached new patch that only normalizes with project as root if no
prenormalization result was obtained
Routing for Craig for review/comment. 
Are you saying that in general, for all artifacts in the workspace we should
resolve the leading '/' to be workspace relative instead of file system
relative?  Or does this only apply only in the context of web projects?

If the former, then we'll need to have a larger discussion on this.

If the latter, and it's just the case that web projects want to use special
'mapping rules' that must apply before the URI is normalized, then I'd suggest
registering a 'prenormalization' resolver extension that knows how to expand the
leading slash accordingly (e.g. '/foo/main.html' --&gt; 
file:///D:/eclipse/workspace/foo/main.html').
Yes, I do mean the former and not specifically for web projects (web/flexible
projects have their own semantics which is why the patch only has an effect
after prenormalization extensions have been given a chance to run).  The
resolution of resources from inside of the workspace should respect the
sandboxing that the workspace represents and resolve "/" as inside of the
workspace.  Does it really make sense for an XML file referring to the system ID
"/foo.dtd" require that every user place foo.dtd in the root of their
workspace's drive?  On Win32 this is merely silly but in a multi-user Unix
environment it might be impossible.
Thanks for clarifying Nitin.  I agree that it would be a nice convenience to be
able to specify workspace relative resources as '/foo/main.html' with the
assumption that if a user ever wanted to specify the root of his Unix file
system they'd specify 'file:///foo/main.html'.  The default EMF behaviour uses
the same convention, so I agree we should add this to the 'base' resolution
behaviour.

How do you think we should expand the '/foo/main.html'?  AFAIK we have 2 choices
here

1) 'platform:/resource/foo/main.html'. 
2) 'file:///D:/myworkspace-location/foo/main.html'

In the vast majority of cases it won't make a difference.  But if resources
contain relative URI's (e.g. '../../blah/foo.xsd') that 'back out' of a project
then (1) would enable '..' to cross projects and (2) would enable '..' to go
outside of the workspace.  The EMF behaviour uses option (1).  I'd suggest we do
the same.


Nitin, I'm a little confused.  I thought from the description that "/" indicated
the workspace root but your patch seems to interpret "/" as the containing
project folder.  Can you clarify?
Yes, my intent with the patch is to use the project itself as the "root".  I'm
not sure how to solve the cross-project reference issue, but I think lookups
should otehrwise be jailed into the conceptual root:  "../../../" from
workspace/project/1 should only go up to workspace/project and never go outside
the workspace.
When considering the workspace vs. project as root issue, cross-project mappings
would best be handled by a separate URI resolver extension, since every project
nature might treat them differently.  Some natures would forbid it while others
might allow it with specially formed URIs.
I'd like to defer this bug until after 0.7 since I think we need to think this
thru carefully before making any changes this late in the release.</WithStack>

    <WithStack>We have a couple of plugins which aren't really plugins, in that they are really 
non-PDE projects that we have converted to plugins so that an RCP project can 
use them.  The problem is that the other non-RCP main development stream relies 
on the use of build.xml files, but unfortunately exporting our Eclipse product 
blows away those build.xml files(with RC1), and we have to be careful not to 
check in the deletion.  I would like to ask that PDE use a different build file 
name that is guaranteed to be a unique temporary file name so that it won't 
overwrite our existing build.xml files.  I notice that https://bugs.eclipse.
org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=87729 essentially addresses the same problem, although 
they were looking for the build.xml to be written to an entirely different 
directory.  Although marked as such, that bug is NOT a true duplication of 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85013.  Whatever worked in those 
cases could maybe be used for this issue?
If those plugins are not real plugins, then I recommend you the following
approach to do only once:
- right click on plugin.xml, and generate the build script
- add in the build.properties, custom=true (which will indicate pde build to not
overwrite the script)
- add your own targets to the generated build.xml and you are done.

Thanks Pascal - I looked at the generated build.xml file, and noted that our own 
build.xml gets almost all its targets through an import tag and that several of 
our target names conflict with those of PDE's generated targets, and then I lost 
my motivation to figure out how to do this!  In the meantime I'll live with 
having to do CVS Override and Update of our own build.xml files after I export 
my RCP product.

Now while I'm here, let me see if I've figured out how to link to bugs better:  
in my initial report I was trying to say that this issue is similar to those of 
bug 87729 and bug 85013.
Of all the targets, the only ones that are used by pde build on product exports are:
- gather.bin.parts
- build.jars (and the targets used to build individual jars)
Isn't that bug directly related to bug 82302?
In the other bug it is requested that pde generates a file with another name
than build.xml, because people don't want to put custom=true in their
build.properties in order not to loose the content of their file. If your
request is the same then close this bug as dup of the other.

Eric, what is the outlook on this defect?  Can this be contained this week?
EM: the serializer writes the XML chart description by using the UTF-8 encoding.
So if the user writes its input file by using an XML syntax for the character
(&amp;#&lt;integer value&gt;;) the same characters will be written in UTF-8 in the output
file.

(ex: &lt;chartTitle label="&amp;#21517;&amp;#21069;"/&gt; becomes 
     &lt;chartTitle label="&lt;hex: e5908d e5898d&gt;"&gt;

I tested to read, write and reread an input xml file with this chart title
definition and it works fine.

&lt;chartTitle label="&amp;#21517;&amp;#21069;"/&gt;   (\u540d\u524d)

2) Called:
 		IChart chart = SerializerImpl.instance().read(document);

3) This calls SerializerImpl.serializeGeneratedDocumentToString() which 
corrupts the input to:

&lt;chartTitle label="å&amp;#65533;&amp;#65533;å‰&amp;#65533;"/&gt;

4) The reporting objects (DGraphic, etc) are populated incorrectly, and the 
rendered chart looks corrupted.  (attaching screenshot)

bad title - screenshot
Misidentified this defect as one of the many Serializer related defects that 
were targeted to 4.1.

Eric, what is the outlook on this defect?  Can this be contained this week?
EM: the serializer writes the XML chart description by using the UTF-8 encoding.
So if the user writes its input file by using an XML syntax for the character
(&amp;#&lt;integer value&gt;;) the same characters will be written in UTF-8 in the output
file.

(ex: &lt;chartTitle label="&amp;#21517;&amp;#21069;"/&gt; becomes 
     &lt;chartTitle label="&lt;hex: e5908d e5898d&gt;"&gt;

I tested to read, write and reread an input xml file with this chart title
definition and it works fine.

    <WithStack>If you start RAServer on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0 update 4, when you bring 
it down with RAStop.sh (or just with kill) it crashes with the following 
console output:

JVMDG217: Dump Handler is Processing Signal 11 - Please Wait.
JVMDG303: JVM Requesting Java core file

The same problem does not occur on SLES 9. The JRE is an IBM 1.4.2 JRE:

J2RE 1.4.2 IBM build cxia32142-20050411

It appears that the culprit may be the file transfer service. If you stomp on 
serviceconfig.xml to set the "jvm" attribute of AgentControllerConfiguration to 
an empty string (and thereby prevent the file transfer service from starting), 
the crash goes away.
Created attachment 22959
Java core dump from crash (Unix text file)

This is the dump created by the crash. Dunno if it is of any use or not.
Scott, can you take a look? Thanks.

I am also seeing this in Windows as well using the IBM JRE 1.4.2 -- it does 
not show up in 3.3 though, I'm investigating.  Not all the code has been 
migrated from 3.3 into 4.0 for the file transfer service but I would still not 
expect to see such a nasty crash to occur.
Sorry, in my haste to go to lunch (never let a hungry developer file a bug :-), 
I forgot some details:

I reproduced this with the v3.3 20050613_0754 dev build. We originally noticed 
it with a 6/8 build. I'm pretty sure we were *not* seeing it with a build from 
around 6/1 or 6/2...sorry, I don't remember the precise archaeology. In any 
case, it looks like something that crept in the first week of June.

Also, all you have to do to reproduce the behavior is:

  RAStart.sh
  RAStop.sh

(or kill, in lieu of RAStop). No need to actually *use* RAServer for anything.

I don't believe we've seen this on Windows, but we might not, given that we 
usually run it as a service.

Yikes, I thought this was a 4.0 only issue, do not at first see you reported 
this against a 3.3 build.  Okay, I will look at this right away and keep the 
defect up to date with status.  There is another defect in Windows with the 
same type of java core dump that occurs after file transfer / deployment has 
completed and when the startProcess0 native method is invoked.  

We recently fixed another issue a week or so ago in and around this code (both 
Java and native code sides) that might have brought this on.  I will update 
this defect with the defect # of the other.

bugzilla_98166 might be related or this could be totally different, but just 
in case I'm adding a dependency on the other defect for cross-reference 
purposes.

Per 6/15 platform call, this defect severity is reduced (even though its a 
crash, it is when RAC is shutting down and is not as major) and will not be 
fixed for 3.3 -- it will be investigated in 4.0 though to get a handle on what 
is really failing.

A readme defect will be opened for 3.3 so as to not alarm end-users when this 
expected SEGV occurs.

[ sizing = 1 day ]

I will verify if this is still the case in TPTP 4.1 -- there were some changes
made in the way RAC allocates and de-allocates memory in certain situations that
fixed another crash-bug like this.

I am no longer able to reproduce this using RHEL 3.0 with the latest TPTP 4.1 i2
bits.  Please re-open if the problem still exists for you in 4.1 or comes back.
 Thanks.

Tobias, can you please investigate if the is an AST rewrite problem or local to
Move member type.
It is a problem with the member visibility adjustor, which tries to correct 
the visibility of all fragments of a field declaration.

Fix is to handle the rewrite of all fragments in a separate case
Created attachment 23137
Patch

This patch fixed the rewriting of field declaration in
MemberVisibilityAdjustor. The field declaration is correctly deleted if all
fragments need to be rewritten.
In the example above, the modifiers (including annotations) are not copied to 
the new field declaration. This patch also accounts for that.

Patch fixes following problems:
- When extracting a variable declaration fragment to a new field declaration, 
it correctly copies all annotations and modifiers (except visibility). It uses 
ModifierRewrite afterwards to set the visibility to the desired flag value
- In case that all fragments have been rewritten, a spurious field declaration 
remained in the code, yielding compile errors. This empty field declaration is 
now removed as well.
+1 for RC3.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 85133 ***</WithStack>
    <WithOutStack>Got the following exception when trying to rename an inner class.  

Steps to reproduce:
1.  Restart workbench.  This only happens the first time I did a refactor.  I 
cannot reproduce after the first failure.
2.  Add a breakpoint in method #printSomething(...)
3.  Rename the MyInnerClass to something else.
4.  Got the exception.

Testcase:
public class MyClass {

	int i=15;
	
	class MyInnerClass{
		public MyInnerClass()
		{
			
		}
		void printSomething()
		{			
			for ( i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
				System.out.println("print something");
		}
	}
	
	public MyClass()
	{
		i++;
		MyInnerClass x = new MyInnerClass();
		x.printSomething();
	}
}

1. Open an xml file using XML Source Page editor
2. dirty it
3. Window-&gt;New Editor
4. now you have 2 editors open on the same file, both dirty
5. close 1 editor
6. editor closes without informing you file was modified and ask you if you 
want to save

If you perform the same type of operation on Text editor, you will get Save 
resource dialog.
This is because in StructuredTextEditor#isSaveOnCloseNeeded it checks to see 
if the current StructuredModel is shared for edit, if it is still shared by 
another, it will not ask to save.

Besides source editor not following the same behaviour as Text editor, it 
seems safer to ask the user if they want to save before closing the main 
editor, regardless of whether or not more editors on the file are open.  What 
if the second editor is hidden somewhere (like embedded in a hidden view)?  Or 
what if the other editor never saves on close?
Changed Version field given new release numbering.

also found issues with if other parts of the editor, like xml design page, has 
modelforedit.  when editor is closed, first thing it does is check if save on 
close is needed.  then it proceeds to close editor.  so if another client is 
using model for edit, it won't have a chance to release before save on close 
is checked.
fix is in isSaveOnCloseNeeded:
Original:
public boolean isSaveOnCloseNeeded() {
	if (getInternalModel() == null)
		return false;
==&gt;	getInternalModel().isSaveNeeded();
}

Fix:
public boolean isSaveOnCloseNeeded() {
	if (getInternalModel() == null)
		return false;
==&gt;	// BUG99793 - always prompt for save if dirty (even if others have
==&gt;	// model for edit)
==&gt;	return getInternalModel().isDirty();
}
adding dependency to bug 106620 because this bug fix is included in that bug's 
fix.
David, please mark this bug as fixed when you apply patches for bug 106620.
Amy, how about removing that method altogether?
Nitin, I thought about that too but I didnt dig deep enough to see if
if (getInternalModel() == null)
	return false;
return getInternalModel().isDirty();

Is equivalent to
IDocumentProvider p= getDocumentProvider();
return p == null ? false : p.canSaveDocument(getEditorInput());

if you can vouch that it is, I can update the patch.
They should be the same at this point, and the error handling for bug 106620
implies that we have to make it the same.  When we don't have a structured
model, the document provider is the only one who knows if a save is needed.
Fixed, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=106620#c8

(Apple 1.5 VM)
Did not actually change the name of the .launch files. I still have both, but this caused another problem...
I tried to rename my "null" config to "Evaluations" and an Error was logged:

Launch configuration null at /Users/kevinbarnes/Desktop/testpass/.metadata/.plugins/
org.eclipse.debug.core/.launches/null.launch does not exist.
restarted my workbench, the Evaluations launch (the one that was renamed null) is there and works. The 
other launch is not.
*** Bug 99795 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
CC'ing Dirk for RC3 approval. Is reproduceable.
+1 for RC3
Fixed in LaunchConfigurationProjectMainTypeChange (simple typo caused rename 
of config when not intended).
Please verify, Kevin.

This works for me using the following steps:

- copy the dlls to a directory thats on your PATH environment variable
- put swt.jar onto the build path of the project
- create main class

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Display d= new Display();
		d.dispose();
	}
}

- execute Main

    <WithStack>There seem to be some severe problems with ScalableRootEditPart in mirrored 
mode.  I noticed several problems when I changed the logic example's root 
editpart to ScalableRootEditPart from ScalableFreeformRootEditPart (and 
LogicDiagramEditPart's figure's layout to XYLayout).  Figures are painting at 
the wrong location (as if they are not mirrored).  The marquee rectangle does 
weird things as well.  The symptoms are much like those described in bug 
99564.  However, advanced graphics is not enabled.
Forgot to mention that the flow example, which also uses the 
ScalableRootEditPart, is not having these problems in mirrored mode.
Okay, so apparently, somewhere along the line advanced graphics is being 
enabled, although I don't think it's explicitly being set anywhere.  Most 
likely another SWT bug.  I'll dig deeper later.
Found the problem.  ScalableLayeredPane is not using ScaledGraphics and is 
setting the scale directly on SWTGraphics.  As a result, advanced graphics is 
being initialized (and transform's being set).  However, even that should 
work.  So that perhaps is a bug in SWTGraphics.
Pratik, ScaledGraphics must be used to avoid requiring advanced graphics 
support. I mistakingly released this change when fixing another bug in 
ScalableLayeredPane.  We need another RC2 to correct this. I suppose we can 
call in RC2a?
BTW, you can't swap the root editpart without also changing the contents figure 
and layout manager. I assume you did this as well and still saw problems?
The remaining problem is a dupe of 99564.  I've updated the summary of this 
bug and am marking it fixed.</WithStack>
